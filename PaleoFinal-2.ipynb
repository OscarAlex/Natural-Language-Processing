       " 'author': 'Enrico de Lazaro',\n",
       " 'date': 'Mar 19, 2021',\n",
       " 'doc': 'A new species of shark with hypertrophied, slender pectoral fins has been identified from the fossilized remains discovered in northern Mexico. The newly identified shark species, named Aquilolamna milarcae, swam in the Late Cretaceous oceans, approximately 93 million years ago. The complete specimen was found in 2012 in Vallecillo, Mexico, a locality yielding remarkably preserved fossils, said lead author Dr. Romain Vullo from the University of Rennes and the CNRS and colleagues. This site, already famous for its many fossils of ammonites, bony fish and other marine reptiles, is most useful for documenting the evolution of oceanic animals. Aquilolamna milarcae belongs to Lamniformes, an order of sharks in the subclass Elasmobranchii. Elasmobranchs are the highly successful group of cartilaginous fishes, including sharks, skates and rays, the paleontologists said. They first appeared in Earths oceans roughly 380 million years ago and have since evolved to fill a diverse array of ecological roles. Modern plankton feeding elasmobranchs are characterized by two distantly related clades  those with a more traditional shark like body shape, such as whale and basking sharks, and those with the sleek, flattened bodies and winglike fins of Mobulidae rays. Standing out among both living and fossil planktivorous plankton eating sharks and rays, Aquilolamna milarcae resides somewhere in between. Aquilolamna milarcae had many features similar to modern manta rays, notably long, slender fins and a mouth adapted to filter feeding, suggesting that it was planktivorous. It had a caudal fin with a well developed superior lobe, typical of most pelagic sharks, such as whale sharks and tiger sharks, Dr. Vullo said. Thus, its anatomical features thus give it a chimeric appearance that combines both sharks and rays. With its large mouth and supposed very small teeth, it must have fed on plankton.  Aquilolamna milarcae was a relatively slow swimmer, using both its long pectoral fins and tail to glide through the water while scooping up suspended plankton using its large, gaping mouth. Its body plan represents an unexpected evolutionary experimentation with underwater flight among sharks, more than 30 million years before the rise of Mobulidae rays, and shows that winglike pectoral fins have evolved independently in two distantly related clades of filter feeding elasmobranches, the researchers said. The discovery of Aquilolamna milarcae is reported in a paper in the journal Science. '}"

      "[{'title': ' Meet Yamatosaurus izanagii, New Hadrosaur from Japan', 'author': 'Enrico de Lazaro', 'date': 'Apr 28, 2021', 'doc': 'Yamatosaurus izanagii roamed our planet 71.8 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous epoch. Hadrosaurs, or duck billed dinosaurs, were successful herbivorous dinosaurs during the Cretaceous period. Their fossil record is known mainly from the Early Cretaceous deposits of Europe and eastern Asia, whereas derived forms are known from the Late Cretaceous rocks of all continents except Australia and the Indian subcontinent. Uniquely adapted to chewing, hadrosaurs had hundreds of closely spaced teeth in their cheeks. As their teeth wore down and fell out, new teeth in the dental battery, or rows of teeth below existing teeth, grew in as replacements. The dental structure of Yamatosaurus izanagii distinguishes it from known hadrosaurs, said Dr. Anthony Fiorillo, a paleontologist in the Institute for the Study of Earth and Man at Southern Methodist University and the Hokkaido University Museum. Unlike other hadrosaurs, the new hadrosaur has just one functional tooth in several battery positions and no branched ridges on the chewing surfaces, suggesting that it evolved to devour different types of vegetation than other hadrosaurs. Yamatosaurus izanagii also is distinguished by the development of its shoulder and forelimbs, an evolutionary step in hadrosaurids gait change from a bipedal to a quadrupedal dinosaur. The fossilized remains of the new hadrosaur  a lower jaw, teeth, neck vertebrae, shoulder bone, and tail vertebra  were found in 2014 by amateur fossil hunter Shingo Kishimoto. They were recovered from blocks of dark gray mudstones of the upper part of the Kita ama Formation exposed at a quarry in Yura Town on Japans Awaji Island. In the far north, where much of our work occurs, hadrosaurs are known as the caribou of the Cretaceous, Dr. Fiorillo said. They most likely used the Bering Land Bridge to cross from Asia to present day Alaska and then spread across North America as far east as Appalachia. The discovery of Yamatosaurus izanagii is reported in a paper in the journal Scientific Reports. '}, {'title': ' Ancient DNA Sheds Light on Evolutionary History of Extinct ‘Horned’ Crocodile', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Apr 27, 2021', 'doc': 'An international team of scientists has recovered and analyzed partial mitochondrial genomes from 1,300 1,400 year old specimens of Voay robustus, a recently extinct species of horned crocodile that lived in Madagascar. Their results indicate that this endemic represented the sister lineage to true crocodiles Crocodylus and that the ancestor of modern crocodiles likely originated in Africa. The arrival of modern humans in Madagascar between 9,000 and 2,500 years ago preceded the extinction of much of the islands vertebrate megafauna including giant tortoises, elephant birds that ranged to enormous size, dwarf hippos, and several lemur species. One lesser known extinction that occurred during this period was the demise of Voay robustus. Early explorers to the island noted that Malagasy peoples consistently referred to two types of living crocodiles on the island, a large robust crocodile and a more gracile form with a preference for rivers. This suggests that both types persisted until very recently, but only the gracile form, now recognized as an isolated population of the Nile crocodile Crocodylus niloticus, is currently found on the island. Voay robustus was hiding out on the island of Madagascar during the time when people were building the pyramids and was probably still there when pirates were getting stranded on the island, said Dr. Evon Hekkala, a researcher at Fordham University and the American Museum of Natural History. They blinked out just before we had the modern genomic tools available to make sense of the relationships of living things. And yet, they were the key to understanding the story of all the crocodiles alive today. Despite nearly 150 years of investigation, the position of Voay robustus in the tree of life has remained controversial. In 1872, French naturalists Alfred Grandidier and Léon Vaillant described it as a new species and placed it within the true crocodile group, which includes the Nile, Asian, and American crocodiles. Then, in the early part of the 20th century, it was thought that the specimens simply represented very old Nile crocodiles. And finally, in 2007, a study based on physical characteristics of the fossil specimens concluded that the horned crocodile was actually not a true crocodile, but in the group that includes dwarf crocodiles. Teasing apart the relationships of modern crocodiles is really difficult because of the physical similarities, Dr. Hekkala said. Many people dont even realize that there are multiple species of crocodiles, and they see them as this animal thats unchanging through time. But weve been trying to get to the bottom of the great diversity that exists among them. To fully examine the place of Voay robustus in the evolutionary tree, Dr. Hekkala and her colleagues made a number of attempts to sequence mitochondrial DNA from fossil specimens. This project weve tried to do on and off for many years, but the technology just hadnt advanced enough, so it always failed, said Dr. George Amato, emeritus director of the Institute for Comparative Genomics at the American Museum of Natural History. But in time, we had both the computational setup and the paleogenomic protocols that could actually fish out this DNA from the fossil and finally find a home for this species. The results place Voay robustus right next to the true crocodile branch of the evolutionary tree, making it the closest species to the common ancestor of the crocodiles alive today. This finding was surprising and also very informative to how we think about the origin of the true crocodiles found around the tropics today, Dr. Amato said. The placement of this individual suggests that true crocodiles originated in Africa and from there, some went to Asia and some went to the Caribbean and the New World. We really needed the DNA to get the correct answer to this question. The results appear in the journal Communications Biology. '}, {'title': ' New Titanosaur Species Unearthed in Chile', 'author': 'Enrico de Lazaro', 'date': 'Apr 26, 2021', 'doc': 'A new genus and species of lithostrotian titanosaur has been identified from a partial skeleton found in northern Chile. Arackar licanantay lived in what is now the Atacama region of Chile during the Late Cretaceous epoch, between 84 and 66 million years ago. The species belongs to Lithostrotia, a large group of derived sauropod dinosaurs in the clade Titanosauria. The Titanosauria is very broad and diverse, with repeated finds in what is now Argentina and Brazil, said Dr. David Rubilar Rogers, a paleontologist at the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural in Chile. However, it is much less frequent to find them on this side of the mountain range. There are very few records of titanosaurs in this territory, which makes Arackar licanantay a very valuable find. The partial skeleton of Arackar licanantay, including cervical and dorsal vertebrae, humerus, femur and ischium, was recovered from the Hornitos Formation in northern Chile. It is the most complete sauropod dinosaur recorded in Chile and the south Pacific margin of South America. It is also the third dinosaur named from Chile, after Atacamatitan chilensis and Chilesaurus diegosuarezi.  Arackar licanantay is a new lithostrotian titanosaur represented by associated and disarticulated bones that belong to a single sub adult specimen of around 6.3 m 20.7 feet long, the paleontologists said. This sauropod is diagnosed by a unique association of features of dorsal vertebrae and appendicular bones. It shares some characters with Rapetosaurus and Bravasaurus, and do not belong to the derived clade Saltasaurinae from Patagonia. Another peculiarity of Arackar licanantay is related to the disposition of its limbs, said Dr. Alexander Vargas, a paleontologist at the Universidad de Chile. A characteristic of many titanosaurs is that their legs were at an open angle. The new dinosaur does not have that angle, it is quite straight compared to the femur of other titanosaurs. The teams paper was published in the journal Cretaceous Research. '}, {'title': ' Paleontologists Find Fossils of Extinct Giant Cloud Rats in Philippines', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Apr 23, 2021', 'doc': 'Paleontologists have unearthed the 67,000 year old fossilized remains from three extinct species of giant cloud rats in several caves on the Philippine island of Luzon. Cloud rats are 18 living species of rodents with fluffy tails in the tribe Phloeomyini. They can be found in the misty mountain forests of the Philippines. They range in size from 18 g to 2.7 kg, typically live in trees, and eat leaves, buds and seeds. Their evolutionary history in the region stretches back around 14 million years, when their ancestors first arrived in the Philippine archipelago from the Asian mainland. The three newly discovered species of cloud rats  Crateromys ballik, Carpomys dakal, and Batomys cagayanensis  are thought to be extinct. Their fossils were found in Callao Cave, where a previously unknown species of human, Homo luzonensis was found in 2019, as well as smaller caves in the Cagayan province. Specimens of all three of the new species of fossil rodent were found in the same deep layer of the cave as the enigmatic Homo luzonensis indicating that they co existed some 60,000 years ago, said Professor Philip Piper, a researcher in the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University. Our records show they were able to adapt and survive profound climatic changes over millions of years, so the question is what might have caused their final extinction? The timing of the last recorded occurrence of two of the species might offer a clue  around 2,000 years ago or shortly after. This is after the first arrival of agricultural societies and the introduction of animals like domestic dogs, pigs and macaque monkeys to the Philippines. That seems significant, because that is roughly the same time that pottery and Neolithic stone tools first appear in the archeological record, and when dogs, domestic pigs, and probably monkeys were introduced to the Philippines, probably from Borneo, said Professor Armand Mijares, a researcher at the University of Philippines. While we cant say for certain based on our current information, this implies that humans likely played some role in their extinction. Crateromys ballik and Carpomys dakal became extinct just a few thousand years ago. They were giants among rodents, both weighing about a kilogram  big enough that it might have been worthwhile to hunt and eat them. We have had evidence of extinct large mammals on the Philippine island of Luzon for a long time, but there has been virtually no information about fossils of smaller sized mammals, said Dr. Janine Ochoa, a researcher at the University of the Philippines The reason is probably that research had focused on open air sites where the large fossil mammal faunas were known to have been preserved, rather than the careful sieving of cave deposits that preserve a broader size range of vertebrates including the teeth and bones of rodents. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the Philippines has the greatest concentration of unique species of mammals of any country, most of which are small animals, less than half a pound, that live in the tropical forest, said Dr. Larry Heaney, a researcher at Field Museum. These recently extinct fossil species not only show that biodiversity was even greater in the very recent past, but that the two that became extinct just a few thousand years ago were giants among rodents, both weighing more than two pounds. By comparing the fossils to the 18 living cloud rat species, the scientists have a decent idea of what Crateromys ballik, Carpomys dakal and Batomys cagayanensis would have looked like. The bigger ones would have looked almost like a woodchuck with a squirrel tail, Dr. Heaney said. Cloud rats eat plants, and theyve got great big pot bellies that allow them to ferment the plants that they eat, kind of like cows. They have big fluffy or furry tails. Theyre really quite cute. The findings were published in the Journal of Mammalogy. '}, {'title': ' Young Tyrannosaurs Had More Slender Feet than Adults, Study Finds', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Apr 23, 2021', 'doc': 'An international team of paleontologists has examined a collection of 72.5 million year old tyrannosaur  probably Albertosaurus  footprints from the Wapiti Formation of Alberta, Canada, to learn more about the way these predatory dinosaurs aged and how they moved. Fossil footprints have long been used to infer aspects of the biology of non avian dinosaurs that are not readily apparent from skeletal remains, including estimated speeds and inferred social behaviors. The footprints can be ambiguous and hard to interpret correctly  the shape of a footprint may be influenced by the type of ground surface that is stepped on and the motions of the animal making the footprints. In addition, the exact identity of the animal may not always be clear. These challenges have previously limited the use of fossil footprints in understanding dinosaur growth. The answer lay in the Grande Prairie region of Alberta in Canada, where University of New England Ph.D. student Nathan Enriquez and his colleagues worked with well preserved samples of footprints of different sizes that are suggested to belong to the same type of animal. We explored a remote dinosaur footprint site where we discovered a new set of large carnivorous dinosaur footprints within very similar rocks to those which have produced tyrannosaur tracks in the past, Enriquez said. Based on the relatively close proximity between these discoveries and their nearly equivalent ages  about 72.5 million years old  we suggest they may indeed belong to the same species. We were also careful to assess the quality of preservation in each footprint, and only considered specimens which were likely to reflect the shape of the actual feet that produced them. Once the paleontologists had a suitable sample, they analyzed the outlines of each specimen using a method called geometric morphometrics. This process removes the effect of overall size differences between each footprint and shows what the most important differences in track shape are. The greatest difference in shape was found to be the relative width and surface area of the heel impression, which significantly increased in size between smaller and larger footprints, Enriquez said. The smaller tracks are comparably slender, while the biggest tyrannosaur tracks are relatively broader and had much larger heel areas. This makes sense for an animal that is becoming larger and needs to support its rapidly increasing body weight. It also suggests the relative speed of these animals decreased with age. Increasingly bulky feet in the adults align with previous suggestions that juvenile tyrannosaurs would have been faster and more agile for their body size in comparison to their parents, and means that we can add footprints as another line of evidence in the debate over tyrannosaur growth. Lastly, it demonstrates the usefulness of footprints for investigating a potentially wider range of ideas about the lives of extinct species than has been considered previously. The findings were published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. '}, {'title': ' Tyrannosaurus rex Walked Slower than Previously Thought', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Apr 21, 2021', 'doc': 'Animals display a variety of gaits and walking speeds. It is commonly assumed that they minimize locomotor energy expenditure by selecting gait kinematics tuned to the natural frequencies of relevant body parts. In a new study, Pasha van Bijlert, a researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Naturalis Biodiversity Center, and his colleagues demonstrated that this allows estimation of the preferred step frequency and walking speed of Tyrannosaurus rex. There were already some studies investigating dinosaur walking speed, but they mostly looked at the legs and ignored the tail  which is what makes dinos so unique, Van Bijlert said. They usually found much higher walking speeds. The one we calculated is lower, but its similar to that of other animals. Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs to ever roam the Earth. The ancient animal lived in the forested river valleys of western North America between 68 and 66 million years ago Late Cretaceous epoch. It measured an average of 12 m long and 4.5 to 6 tall, had large jaws and serrated teeth. Tyrannosaurus rex didnt just have two legs, it also had an enormous tail that helped it move around. Like the bones in our necks, the bones in tails are held together by ligaments. You could compare it with a suspension bridge. A suspension bridge with a ton of muscle in it, Van Bijlert said. Every step the tail swings up and down. That means that like the swing, it has a natural frequency at which it resonates.  To find out what that frequency is, Van Bijlert and co authors built a 3D model of Trix, an individual of Tyrannosaurus rex on display at the Dutch National Museum of Natural History, Naturalis. The paleontologists added digital muscles to the famous skeleton, and on this muscular model they could perform biomechanical analyses. They determined the tail natural frequency of Tyrannosaurus rex 0.66 timess, range 0.41 0.84, and the walking speed 1.28 ms, range 0.8 1.64. Our results for preferred walking speed of Tyrannosaurus rex are lower than previous estimations for large theropods, but more closely match the preferred walking speeds of a variety of extant animals, regardless of gait pattern and body size, they said. The teams results were published in the journal Royal Society Open Science. '}, {'title': ' Tyrannosaurs Lived in Groups, New Evidence Suggests', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Apr 21, 2021', 'doc': 'Tyrannosaurs  theropod dinosaurs that lived in what is now North America and Asia between 100 and 66 million years ago Cretaceous period  may not have been solitary hunters as popularly envisioned. The idea that tyrannosaurs were social with complex hunting strategies was first formulated by Canadian paleontologist Professor Philip Currie in 1998. It was based on the discovery of skeletons of over 12 Albertosaurus sarcophagus individuals at a site in Alberta, Canada. The idea has been widely debated, with many paleontologists doubting the giant predators had the brainpower to organize into anything more complex than what is observed in modern crocodiles. Because the Alberta site appeared to be an isolated case, skeptics claimed it represented unusual circumstances that did not reflect normal tyrannosaur behavior. The 2005 discovery of a second tyrannosaur mass death site in Montana again raised the possibility of social tyrannosaurs, but that site was still not widely accepted by the scientific community as evidence for social behavior. Localities that produce insights into the possible behavior of extinct animals are especially rare, and difficult to interpret, Professor Currie said. In the new research, Bureau of Land Management paleontologist Alan Titus and colleagues examined a recently discovered large bonebed containing at least four individuals of the tyrannosaur species Teratophoneus curriei. Called the Rainbows and Unicorns Quarry, the site is located in the northern Kaiparowits Plateau area of Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. Using analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes and concentrations of rare earth elements within the bones and rock, the researchers found that the remains from the site all fossilized in the same environment and were not the result of an attritional assemblage of fossils washed in from a variety of areas. They concluded that a group of Teratophoneus curriei died together during a seasonal flooding event that washed their carcasses into a lake, where they sat, largely undisturbed until the river later churned its way through the bone bed. Traditional excavation techniques, supplemented by the analysis of rare earth elements, stable isotopes and charcoal concentrations convincingly show a synchronous death event at the Rainbows site of four or five tyrannosaurids, Professor Currie said. Undoubtedly, this group died together, which adds to a growing body of evidence that tyrannosaurids were capable of interacting as gregarious packs. The new Utah site adds to the growing body of evidence showing that tyrannosaurs were complex, large predators capable of social behaviors common in many of their living relatives, the birds, said Dr. Joe Sertich, curator of dinosaurs at the Denver Museum of Nature  Science. This discovery should be the tipping point for reconsidering how these top carnivores behaved and hunted across the northern hemisphere during the Cretaceous. The study was published online in the journal PeerJ.

Fossil records are incomplete, and many species of mammals, in particular those that lived at low population densities, are seldom found. For these ancient species, destructive DNA extraction from fossil remains has the potential to reveal new insights into population and evolutionary history however, it also causes irreversible damage to high value specimens. The discovery that DNA from past populations of organisms could be obtained directly from sediment, therefore, held great promise for ancient population genetics and phylogenetics. Commonly known as environmental DNA eDNA research, this approach relies on sequencing DNA fragments derived from shed cells, hair, feces, and urine preserved within sediment. Standard eDNA techniques allow species composition to be determined in the absence of macrofossils across a variety of environments including sediments, cave formations, ice cores, lakes, rivers, and oceans. To date, however, analyses of ancient eDNA have been restricted to mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA or, more recently, to short and highly diverse sequences generated using a shotgun sequencing approach. When an animal or a human urinates or defecates, cells from the organism are also excreted. And the DNA fragments from these cells are what we can detect in the soil samples, said Professor Eske Willerslev, a researcher in the Department of Zoology at the University of Cambridge and the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre at the University of Copenhagen. Using extremely powerful sequencing techniques, we reconstructed genomes  genetic profiles  based on these fragments for the first time. We have shown that hair, urine and feces all provide genetic material which, in the right conditions, can survive for much longer than 10,000 years. In the study, Professor Willerslev and his colleagues retrieved ancient genome wide data from 16,000  to 14,000 year old sediments in Chiquihuite Cave in Astillero Mountains, Mexico. Their analysis shows that the Late Pleistocene black bear population in Mexico is ancestrally related to the present day Eastern American black bear population, and that the extinct giant short faced bears present in Mexico were deeply divergent from the earlier Beringian population. The short faced bears that lived in northern Mexico were distinctly different from the population of black bears living in north western Canada, said Dr. Mikkel Winther Pedersen, a researcher in the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre at the GLOBE Institute at the University of Copenhagen. This is an excellent example of the new knowledge that suddenly becomes available when you reconstruct genomes based on eDNA fragments extracted from soil. All over the world, everyone scientifically involved in the study of ancient DNA recognised the need to reconstruct genomes from fragments found in soil or sediment, Professor Willerslev said. Being able to do that for the first time means we have opened up a new frontier. Analysis of DNA found in soil could have the potential to expand the narrative about everything from the evolution of species to developments in climate change  this is the moon landing of genomics because fossils will no longer be needed. A paper describing the research was published in the journal Current Biology. '}, {'title': ' How Many Tyrannosaurus rex Individuals Ever Roamed Earth?', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Apr 16, 2021', 'doc': 'Paleontologists estimate that the abundance of one of the best known dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex, at any one time was about 20,000 individuals, that the species persisted for 127,000 generations, and that the total number of Tyrannosaurus rex that ever lived was 2.5 billion individuals. Much can be learned from the fossil record about extinct species like the dinosaurs. However, due to the records fragmented nature, understanding ecological variables such as population density and abundance remains challenging. In living species, one way to understand more about these variables is by using the established relationship between population density and body mass, or Damuths Law, which states that the average population density of a species decreases with body size at a predictable rate. Using this law and the large body of paleontological data for Tyrannosaurus rex, Professor Charles Marshall from the University of California Museum of Paleontology and his colleagues estimated population level traits and the rate of fossil preservation for the species. The researchers mined the scientific literature for data they used to estimate that the likely age at sexual maturity of a Tyrannosaurus rex was 15.5 years its maximum lifespan was probably into its late 20s and its average body mass as an adult was about 5.2 tons. They also used data on how quickly Tyrannosaurus rex grew over their life span they had a growth spurt around sexual maturity and could grow to weigh about 7 tons. From these estimates, they calculated that each generation lasted about 19 years, and that the average population density was about one dinosaur for every 100 km2. Then, estimating that the total geographic range of Tyrannosaurus rex was about 2.3 million km2, and that the species survived for roughly 2.5 million years, they calculated a standing population size of 20,000. Over a total of about 127,000 generations that the species lived, that translates to about 2.5 billion individuals overall. Whats more, the scientists estimate that the population density of the species equated to 3,800 Tyrannosaurus rex in an area the size of California. The results also allowed them to determine that only about 1 in 80 million Tyrannosaurus rex survived the eons as fossilized remains. There are about 32 relatively well preserved, post juvenile Tyrannosaurus rexes in public museums today, Professor Marshall said. Of all the post juvenile adults that ever lived, this means we have about one in 80 million of them. If we restrict our analysis of the fossil recovery rate to where Tyrannosaurus rex fossils are most common, a portion of the famous Hell Creek Formation in Montana, we estimate we have recovered about one in 16,000 of the Tyrannosaurus rexes that lived in that region over that time interval that the rocks were deposited. We were surprised by this number this fossil record has a much higher representation of the living than I first guessed. It could be as good as one in a 1,000, if hardly any lived there, or it could be as low as one in a quarter million, given the uncertainties in the estimated population densities of the beast. The teams results were published today in the journal Science. '}, {'title': ' World’s Smallest Stegosaur Footprint Found', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Apr 16, 2021', 'doc': 'An international team of paleontologists has discovered a 5.7 cm long stegosaur footprint in Xinjiang province, China. The newly discovered stegosaur footprint was left around 110 million years ago Early Cretaceous epoch. It belongs to the ichnogenus Deltapodus and co occurs with the tracks of larger individuals. Found in the Tugulu Group, Chinas Xinjiang province, it is only 15 as long as the type of Deltapodus curriei from the same locality. This footprint was made by an herbivorous, armored dinosaur known broadly as a stegosaur  the family of dinosaurs that includes the famed Stegosaurus, said Dr. Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Queensland. Like Stegosaurus, this little dinosaur probably had spikes on its tail and bony plates along its back as an adult. With a footprint of less than 6 cm, this is the smallest stegosaur footprint known in the world. Its in strong contrast with other stegosaur prints found at the Chinese track site which measured up to 30 cm, and prints found in places like Broome in Western Australia where they can be up to 80 cm. The tiny stegosaur footprint has similar characteristics of other stegosaur footprints with three short, wide, round toe impressions. However, Dr. Romilio and colleagues found the print wasnt elongated like larger counterpart prints discovered at the track sites, which suggests the young stegosaur had a different behavior. Stegosaurs typically walked with their heels on the ground, much like humans do, but on all fours which creates long footprints, Dr. Romilio said. The tiny track shows that this dinosaur had been moving with its heel lifted off the ground, much like a bird or cat does today. Weve only previously seen shortened tracks like this when dinosaurs walked on two legs. It was plausible young stegosaurs were toe walkers, said Dr. Lida Xing, a paleontologist in the State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology and the School of the Earth Sciences and Resources at the China University of Geosciences. This could be possible as this is the ancestral condition and a posture of most dinosaurs, but the stegosaur could also have transitioned to heel walking as it got older. A complete set of tracks of these tiny footprints would provide us with the answer to this question, but unfortunately we only have a single footprint. The study was published online in the journal Palaios. '}, {'title': ' Paleontologists Unlock Secret of Azhdarchid Pterosaurs’ Extremely Long Necks', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Apr 15, 2021', 'doc': 'Paleontologists have found that the thin neck vertebrae of the azhdarchid pterosaurs got their strength from an intricate internal structure. Pterosaurs  flying reptiles of the Mesozoic era  made their first appearance in the fossil record in the Late Triassic and survived until the end of the Cretaceous approximately 66 million years ago. Although some pterosaurs were small, with wingspans of less than 1 m, members of the enigmatic pterosaur family Azhdarchidae achieved wingspans of up to 10 m, possibly even as high as 12 m. The azhdarchids are notable for elongation of the neck as a result of hyper elongation of their cervical vertebrae. These animals had ridiculously long necks, said Cariad Williams, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. In some species, the fifth vertebra of the neck from the head end is as long as the animals body. It makes a giraffe look perfectly normal. We wanted to know a bit about how this incredibly long neck functioned, as it seems to have very little mobility between each vertebra. Williams and colleagues investigated the internal micro architecture of a well preserved cervical vertebra from the Cretaceous azhdarchid pterosaur Alanqa sp. found in the Kem Kem Group of Morocco. One of our most important findings is the arrangement of cross struts within the vertebral centrum, said Dr. Dave Martill, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth. It is unlike anything seen previously in a vertebra of any animal. The neural tube is placed centrally within the vertebra and is connected to the external wall via a number of thin rod like trabeculae, radially arranged like the spokes of a bicycle wheel and helically arranged along the length of the vertebra. They even cross over like the spokes of a bicycle wheel. Evolution shaped these creatures into awesome, breathtakingly efficient flyers. The teams analysis suggests that as few as 50 of the spoke like trabeculae increased the amount of weight azhdarchid necks could carry without buckling by 90. Together with the basic tube within a tube structure, it explains how the relatively light weight animals could capture and carry heavy prey items without breaking their necks. It appears that this structure of extremely thin cervical vertebrae and added helically arranged cross struts resolved many concerns about the biomechanics of how these creatures were able to support massive heads  longer than 1.5 m  on necks longer than that of the modern day giraffe, all whilst retaining the ability of powered flight, Dr. Martill said. While pterosaurs are sometimes thought of as evolutionary dead ends, the new findings reveal them as fantastically complex and sophisticated. Their bones and skeletons were marvels of biology  extremely light yet strong and durable, the paleontologists said. Theres still much to learn in future work about pterosaurs, including seemingly basic questions about their flight abilities and feeding ecology. The findings appear in the journal iScience. '}, {'title': ' 98-Million-Year-Old Pollen-Feeding Beetle Found Preserved in Amber', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Apr 14, 2021', 'doc': 'Paleontologists have found an exceptionally preserved short winged flower beetle and associated pollen aggregations and coprolites in a piece of mid Cretaceous amber originating from northern Myanmar. The discovery provides the direct evidence of pollen feeding in a Cretaceous beetle and confirms that diverse beetle lineages visited early angiosperms flowering plants in the Cretaceous period. Beetles are often cited as likely candidates for the earliest pollinators of angiosperms due to their long evolutionary history. Ii has been suggested that early associations between beetles and angiosperms in the Cretaceous played a key role in the diversification of both groups. Until now, pollination in beetles has been determined only on the basis of amber inclusions being preserved alongside pollen grains, possessing morphological features interpreted as possibly facilitating pollination, and having living relatives that are known to feed on pollen. The newly identified pollen feeding beetle, named Pelretes vivificus, lived 98.2 million year ago in what is now Myanmar. Its closest relatives are short winged flower beetles family Kateretidae that today occur in Australia, visiting a diverse range of flowers and feeding on their pollen. Pelretes vivificus is associated with clusters of pollen grains, suggesting that short winged flower beetles visited angiosperms in the Cretaceous, said Professor Chenyang Cai, a paleontologist at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. Some aspects of the beetles anatomy, such as its hairy abdomen, are also adaptations associated with pollination. The piece of amber examined by the team came from a mine in the Hukawng Valley, Kachin State, northern Myanmar. Besides the unparalleled abundance of fossil insects, the amber dates back to the mid Cretaceous, right when angiosperms were taking off, said Dr. Erik Tihelka, an entomologist and paleontologist at the University of Bristol. While Pelretes vivificus is not the first pollinating beetle to be described from Cretaceous amber, this unique specimen preserves a bizarre clue about its diet. The fossil is associated with beetle coprolites that provide a very unusual but important insight into the diet of short winged flower beetles in the Cretaceous. The coprolites are completely composed of pollen, the same type that is found in clusters surrounding the beetle and attached to its body, which suggest that Pelretes vivificus visited angiosperms to feed on their pollen. This finding provides a direct link between early flowering plants in the Cretaceous and their insect visitors. It shows that these insect fossils were not just incidentally co preserved with pollen, but that there was a genuine biological association between the two. The pollen associated with the beetle can be assigned to the fossil genus Tricolpopollenites, said Dr. Liqin Li, a fossil pollen specialist at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. This group is attributed to the eudicots, a living group of derived angiosperms, that includes the orders Malpighiales and Ericales. This shows that pollinators took advantage of early angiosperms soon after their initial diversification and visited a diverse range of groups by the mid Cretaceous, Professor Cai added. The teams paper was published in the journal Nature Plants. '}, {'title': ' Small Jurassic Pterosaur Had an Opposed Thumb', 'author': 'Enrico de Lazaro', 'date': 'Apr 13, 2021', 'doc': 'Opposed thumbs are adaptations to arboreal life and rare for non mammal vertebrates Kunpengopterus antipollicatus, a newly discovered species of arboreal pterosaur that inhabited a unique forest ecosystem in what is now China during the Jurassic period, shows the oldest record of such a feature. Kunpengopterus antipollicatus is thought to have lived between 161 and 158 million years ago Jurassic period. The flying reptile had a small body, a primitive, elongate tail, and an estimated wingspan of 85 cm 33.5 inches. It was a type of a darwinopteran, a primitive subgroup of predatory pterosaurs with transitional anatomy. Darwinopterans are a group of pterosaurs from the Jurassic of China and Europe, named after Charles Darwin due to their unique transitional anatomy that has revealed how evolution affected the anatomy of pterosaurs throughout time, explained Dr. Rodrigo V. Pêgas, a paleontologist at the Federal University of ABC. Nicknamed Monkeydactyl, Kunpengopterus antipollicatus is the first known pterosaur with an opposed pollex thumb. This species also represents the earliest record of a true opposed thumb in Earths history. The fingers of Monkeydactyl are tiny and partly embedded in the slab, said Dr. Fion Waisum Ma, a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Birmingham. Thanks to micro CT scanning, we could see through the rocks, create digital models and tell how the opposed thumb articulates with the other finger bones. This is an interesting discovery. It provides the earliest evidence of a true opposed thumb, and it is from a pterosaur  which wasnt known for having an opposed thumb. By studying its forelimb morphology and musculature, the paleontologists suggest that Kunpengopterus antipollicatus could have used its hand for grasping, which is likely an adaptation for arboreal life. A true opposed pollex is mostly present in mammals e.g. primates and some tree frogs, but extremely rare among extant reptiles except for chameleons, the researchers said. This discovery adds to the list that darwinopteran pterosaurs such as Kunpengopterus antipollicatus also evolved an opposed thumb. The two fossilized specimens of Kunpengopterus antipollicatus  one of which with two associated eggs  were recovered form the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning in China. Tiaojishan paleoforest is home to many organisms, including three genera of darwinopteran pterosaurs, said Dr. Xuanyu Zhou, a paleontologist at China University of Geosciences. Our results show that Kunpengopterus antipollicatus has occupied a different niche from Darwinopterus and Wukongopterus, which has likely minimized competition among these pterosaurs. On top of that, a particular darwinopteran fossil has been preserved with two associated eggs, revealing clues to pterosaur reproduction, Dr. Pêgas said. Theyve always been considered precious fossils for these reasons and it is impressive that new darwinopteran species continue to surprise us The study was published in the journal Current Biology.

Life restoration of Ornatops incantatus. Illustration by Brian Engh  httpdontmesswithdinosaurs.com, commissioned by Western Science Center. Dubbed Ornatops incantatus, the new dinosaur roamed Earth around 80 million years ago Late Cretaceous epoch. Its partial skeleton, including part of the skull, was found at a single locality in the Menefee Formation in San Juan County, New Mexico. The Menefee Formation represents one of the most promising frontiers for exploring the early evolution of major dinosaur groups in Laramidia, the Upper Cretaceous landmass consisting of Mexico, the western United States, western Canada, and Alaska, Dr. Andrew McDonald from the Western Science Center and colleagues wrote in their paper. Dating to approximately 84 78 million years ago, the Menefee Formation predates the most productive Upper Cretaceous dinosaur bearing units in western North America, such as the Kirtland Formation of New Mexico, the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, and the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta. Ornatops incantatus is a member of Brachylophosaurini, a group of hadrosaurid dinosaurs that inhabited western North America during the Campanian age 84 72 million years ago of the Cretaceous period. Features of the skull roof and braincase identify the new hadrosaurid as a member of Brachylophosaurini, one of several subclades within Saurolophinae, the solid crested hadrosaurids, the paleontologists explained. The new species is closely related to  and possibly intermediate between  two other brachylophosaurin species Probrachylophosaurus bergei and Brachylophosaurus canadensis. Ornatops incantatus is the first brachylophosaurin hadrosaur from New Mexico and the southernmost occurrence of the group, the researchers wrote. It is also the first crested brachylophosaurin discovered in the southern part of Laramidia. The teams paper was published online April 2, 2021 in the journal PeerJ.

A research team led by Dr. Danielle Fraser from the Canadian Museum of Nature, Carleton University, and Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, investigated if and how diets of Yukon gray wolves changed from the Pleistocene 50,000 to 26,000 years ago to the recent times. We can study the change in diet by examining wear patterns on the teeth and chemical traces in the wolf bones, said Zoe Landry, a student at Carleton University. These can tell us a lot about how the animal ate, and what the animal was eating throughout its life, up until about a few weeks before it died. Dr. Fraser, Landry and their colleagues relied on established models that can determine an animals eating behavior by examining microscopic wear patterns on its teeth. Scratch marks indicate the wolf would have been consuming flesh, while the presence of pits would suggest chewing and gnawing on bones, likely as a scavenger. The analysis showed that scratch marks prevailed in both the ancient and modern wolf teeth, meaning that the wolves continued to survive as primary predators, hunting their prey. Their modern diet is well established the diet of the ancient wolves was assessed by looking at the ratios of carbon and nitrogen isotopes extracted from collagen in the bones. Relative levels of the isotopes can be compared with established indicators for specific species. The results showed that horses, which went extinct during the Pleistocene, accounted for about half of the gray wolf diet. About 15 came from caribou and Dalls sheep, with some mammoth mixed in. At this time, the ancient wolves would have co existed with other large predators such as scimitar cats and short faced bears. The eventual extinction of these predators could have created more opportunity for the wolves to transition to new prey species. This is really a story of Ice Age survival and adaptation, and the building up of a species towards the modern form in terms of ecological adaptation, said Dr. Grant Zazula, a paleontologist with the Palaeontology Program of Government of Yukon.

Jueconodon cheni is a eutriconodontan, a distant cousin of modern placental mammals and marsupials, and was 17.8 cm 7 inches long. Fossiomanus sinensis is an herbivorous mammal like animal called a tritylodontid, and was 31.6 cm 12.2 inches in length. It is the first of its kind to be identified in the Jehol Biota. The Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota has generated many well preserved fossils that have furnished a great deal of information on the morphology and evolution of early mammals, said Dr. Jin Meng from the American Museum of Natural History and colleagues. The two new species expand the diversity of the mammaliamorph assemblage and increase its morphological disparity, as they show unequivocal evidence of convergent adaptation for a fossorial lifestyle. The two specimens also provide an opportunity to learn more about the biology such as axial skeletal development of these extinct forms. Mammals that are adapted to burrowing have specialized traits for digging. Dr. Meng and co authors found some of these hallmark features  such as shorter limbs, strong forelimbs with robust hands, and a short tail  in both Fossiomanus sinensis and Jueconodon cheni. In particular, these characteristics point to a type of digging behavior known as scratch digging, accomplished mainly by the claws of the forelimbs. There are many hypotheses about why animals dig into the soil and live underground, Dr. Meng said. For protection against predators, to maintain a temperature thats relatively constant or to find food sources like insects and plant roots. These two fossils are a very unusual, deep time example of animals that are not closely related and yet both evolved the highly specialized characteristics of a digger. Fossiomanus sinensis and Jueconodon cheni also share another unusual feature an elongated vertebral column. Typically, mammals have 26 vertebrae from the neck to the hip. However, Fossiomanus sinensis had 38 vertebrae, while Jueconodon cheni had 28. To try to determine how these animals got their elongated trunks, the paleontologists turned to recent studies in developmental biology. They found that the variation could be attributed to gene mutations that determine the number and shape of the vertebrae in the beginning of the animals embryotic development. These fossils shed light on the evolutionary development of the axial skeleton in mammaliamorphs, which has been the focus of numerous studies in vertebrate evolution and developmental biology, they said. The discovery of Fossiomanus sinensis and Jueconodon cheni is reported in the journal Nature. '}, {'title': ' Trilobites were Leg Breathers, New Research Shows', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Apr 2, 2021', 'doc': 'Trilobites had well developed gill like structures in their upper leg branches, according to a new imaging study led by the University of California, Riverside. Trilobites are extinct marine arthropods that dominated the ecosystems of the Paleozoic era. They appeared in ancient oceans in the Early Cambrian period, about 540 million years ago, well before life emerged on land, and disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the Permian period, about 252 million years ago. They were extremely diverse, with about 20,000 species, and their fossil exoskeletons can be found all around the world. Up until now, scientists have compared the upper branch of the trilobite leg to the non respiratory upper branch in crustaceans, but our paper shows, for the first time, that the upper branch functioned as a gill, said lead author Dr. Jin Bo Hou, a doctoral student in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of California, Riverside. Dr. Hou and colleagues examined the pyritized remains of two trilobite species Olenoides serratus from the Burgess Shale and Triarthrus eatoni from the Beechers Beds. Triarthrus eatoni lived approximately 450 million years ago Ordovician period Olenoides serratus lived during the Cambrian period, about 500 million years ago. These were preserved in pyrite  fools gold  but its more important than gold to us, because its key to understanding these ancient structures, said co author Professor Nigel Hughes, a paleontologist in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of California, Riverside, and the Geological Studies Unit at the Indian Statistical Institute. Using a CT scanner, the researchers created 3D models of dumbbell shaped filaments in the upper limb branches of both Olenoides serratus and Triarthrus eatoni. It allowed us to see the fossil without having to do a lot of drilling and grinding away at the rock covering the specimen, said Dr. Melanie Hopkins, a paleontologist in the Division of Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. This way we could get a view that would even be hard to see under a microscope  really small trilobite anatomical structures on the order of 10 to 30 microns wide. The researchers could see how blood would have filtered through chambers in these delicate structures, picking up oxygen along its way as it moved. They appear much the same as gills in modern marine arthropods like crabs and lobsters. In the past, there was some debate about the purpose of these structures because the upper leg isnt a great location for breathing apparatus, Dr. Hopkins said. Youd think it would be easy for those filaments to get clogged with sediment where they are. Its an open question why they evolved the structure in that place on their bodies. The findings appear in the journal Science Advances. '}, {'title': ' Dinosaur-Killing Chicxulub Asteroid Gave Rise to Modern Neotropical Rainforests, Study Shows', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Apr 2, 2021', 'doc': 'About 66 million years ago the end of the Cretaceous period, a 10 km wide asteroid crashed into Earth near the site of the small town of Chicxulub in what is now Mexico. The impact unleashed an incredible amount of climate changing gases into the atmosphere, triggering a chain of events that led to the extinction of non avian dinosaurs and 75 of life on the planet. In an analysis of thousands of fossil pollen and leaves from before and after the Chicxulub impact, scientists from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and elsewhere found that the cataclysmic impact also caused 45 of plants in what is now Colombia to go extinct, setting the stage for the evolution of the Neotropical rainforests. In the study, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute paleontologist Dr. Carlos Jaramillo and colleagues examined fossil pollen over 50,000 occurrences and leaves over 6,000 specimens from before and after the Chicxulub impact from 39 localities in Colombia. We wondered how tropical rainforests changed after a drastic ecological perturbation such as the Chicxulub impact, so we looked for tropical plant fossils, explained first author Dr. Mónica Carvalho, a postdoctoral researcher at Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Universidad del Rosario. Pollen and spores obtained from rocks older than the impact show that rainforests were equally dominated by ferns and flowering plants. Conifers were common and cast their shadows over dinosaur trails. After the impact, conifers disappeared almost completely from the New World tropics, and flowering plants took over. Plant diversity did not recover for over 6 million years after the impact. The researchers found evidence that pre impact tropical forest trees were spaced far apart, allowing light to reach the forest floor. Within 6 million years post impact, some tropical forests were dense, like those of today, where leaves of trees and vines cast deep shade on the smaller trees, bushes and herbaceous plants below. The sparser canopies of the pre impact forests, with fewer flowering plants, would have moved less soil water into the atmosphere than did those that grew up in the millions of years afterward. It was just as rainy back in the Cretaceous, but the forests worked differently, Dr. Carvalho said. The team found no evidence of legume trees before the extinction event, but afterward there was a great diversity and abundance of legume leaves and pods. Today, legumes are a dominant family in tropical rainforests, and through associations with bacteria, take nitrogen from the air and turn it into fertilizer for the soil. The rise of legumes would have dramatically affected the nitrogen cycle. How did the after effects of the impact transform sparse, conifer rich tropical forests of the dinosaur age into the rainforests of today  towering trees dotted with yellow, purple and pink blossoms, dripping with orchids? Based on evidence from both pollen and leaves, Dr. Jaramillo, Dr. Carvalho and their colleagues propose three explanations for the change, all of which may be correct. One idea is that dinosaurs kept pre impact forests open by feeding and moving through the landscape. A second explanation is that falling ash from the impact enriched soils throughout the tropics, giving an advantage to the faster growing flowering plants. The third explanation is that preferential extinction of conifer species created an opportunity for flowering plants to take over the tropics. Our study follows a simple question How do tropical rainforests evolve?, Dr. Carvalho said. The lesson learned here is that under rapid disturbances  geologically speaking  tropical ecosystems do not just bounce back they are replaced, and the process takes a really long time. A paper on the findings was published in the journal Science.

Llukalkan aliocranianus roamed our planet during the Late Cretaceous epoch, about 80 million years ago. The dinosaur was a member of Abelisauridae, a family of big predators known from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. It grew to about 5 m\\xa016.4 feet in length, and had extremely powerful bite, very sharp teeth, huge claws, and keen sense of smell. It also had a strange short skull with rough bones, so in life its head had bulges and prominences like some living reptiles. But the most distinctive feature of Llukalkan aliocranianus is a small posterior air filled sinus in the middle ear zone that has not been seen in any other abelisaurid found so far, said Dr. Ariel Mendez, a paleontologist at the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. It means that this dinosaur likely heard differently to other abelisaurids  most probably better and similar to that of a modern day crocodile. This finding implies a different hearing adaptation from other abelisaurids, and likely a keener sense of hearing. The fossilized cranial remains of Llukalkan aliocranianus were recovered from the Bajo de la Carpa Formation at La Invernada fossil area in northwestern Patagonia, Argentina. According to the team, the ancient predator lived in the same small area and period of time as Viavenator exxoni, another species of furileusaurian abelisaurid from the Bajo de la Carpa Formation. This is a particularly important discovery because it suggests that the diversity and abundance of abelisaurids were remarkable, not only across Patagonia, but also in more local areas during the dinosaurs twilight period, said Dr. Federico Gianechini, a paleontologist at the National University of San Luis. Llukalkan aliocranianus was similar in many respects to Viavenator exxoni, except that it was smaller, the holes in the skull through which the veins pass were larger and more widely separated from the supraoccipital crest, among other differences. This discovery also suggests that there are likely more abelisaurid out there that we just havent found yet, so we will be looking for other new species and a better understanding of the relationship among furilesaurs, Dr. Gianechini said. The discovery of Llukalkan aliocranianus is reported in a paper published this week in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. '}, {'title': ' Giant Extinct Australian Birds Had Well-Developed Stereoscopic Vision and Small Brain', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Mar 25, 2021', 'doc': 'Paleontologists from Flinders University have examined the brains of four species of extinct giant mihirungs dromornithid birds Ilbandornis woodburnei and three species of the genus Dromornis. Dromornithids are an extinct group of large flightless birds that lived in Australia from the Eocene to the Late Pleistocene epoch. Four genera and eight species are currently recognized, with diversity highest in the Miocene epoch. Collectively known as mihirungs an Aboriginal word for a giant bird, these birds not only reached much larger sizes than ratites emus, cassowaries, ostriches, kiwis and kin, but were much more intimidating in appearance. Unlike the small headed ratites, they had massive skulls, with sail like bills. Even the smallest of these birds was as large as an emu, while others grew to the size of a horse, with males weighing up to 650 kg. Despite their size, all were gentle giants, browsing on fruit and leaves of shrubs. Together with their large, forward facing eyes and very large bills, the shape of their brains and nerves suggested these birds likely had well developed stereoscopic vision, or depth perception, and fed on a diet of soft leaves and fruit, said Dr. Warren Handley, a vertebrate paleontologist in the Palaeontology Group at Flinders University. The shape of their brains and nerves has told us a lot about their sensory capabilities, and something about their possible lifestyle which enabled these remarkable birds to live in the forests around river channels and lakes across Australia for an extremely long time. Its exciting when we can apply modern imaging methods to reveal features of dromornithid morphology that were previously completely unknown. In the study, Dr. Handley and his colleagues, Dr. Trevor Worthy from the Palaeontology Group at Flinders University, compared the brain structures of four mihirung species from the earliest Dromornis murrayi that lived 24 million years ago to Dromornis planei and Ilbandornis woodburnei from 12 million years ago and Dromornis stirtoni from 7 million years ago. Ranging from cassowary in size to whats known as the worlds largest bird, the largest and last species Dromornis stirtoni was an extreme evolutionary experiment, Dr. Worthy said. The researchers found that mihirung brains and nerves were most like those of modern day chickens and Australian mallee fowl. The unlikely truth is these birds were related to fowl  chickens and ducks  but their closest cousin and much of their biology still remains a mystery, Dr. Worthy said. While the brains of dromornithids were very different to any bird living today, it also appears they shared a similar reliance on good vision for survival with living ratities such as ostrich and emu. Dromornis stirtoni had the largest skull but behind the massive bill was a weird cranium, he added. To accommodate the muscles to wield this massive bill, the cranium had become taller and wider than it was long, and so the brain within was squeezed and flattened to fit. It would appear these giant birds were probably what evolution produced when it gave chickens free reign in Australian environmental conditions and so they became very different to their relatives the megapodes  or chicken like landfowls which still exist in the Australasian region. The results were published in the March 2021 issue of the journal Diversity. '}, {'title': ' Paleontologists Uncover Remains of Extinct Tree-Climbing Kangaroo', 'author': 'Enrico de Lazaro', 'date': 'Mar 25, 2021', 'doc': 'Congruus kitcheneri, an extinct species of\\xa0kangaroo that lived in Australia between 2.6 million and 12,000 years ago, was adapted for climbing trees, although it was larger and not as specialized for arboreal living as the tree kangaroos. Kangaroos and their relatives family Macropodidae descended from arboreal possum like ancestors during the Paleogene period before becoming the main ground dwelling mammalian herbivores of the Australian continent over the past 20 million years, said Flinders Universitys Professor Gavin Prideaux and Dr. Natalie Warburton of Murdoch University. There are more than 60 living species, including bettongs, wallabies and kangaroos, and many more extinct species, including giant short faced kangaroos. Smaller extant macropodids are mainly solitary fungivores or browsers, while larger species tend to be grass consumers. Eleven of the 12 living macropodine genera are characterized by species that are principally ground dwelling. They employ a bipedal hopping when moving at speed, and a pentapedal mode, involving the use of the tail as a fifth limb when moving slowly. These locomotory styles are facilitated by striking adaptations in physiology and skeletal anatomy, including elongation of the hindlimbs and feet, and reconfiguration of the ankle joint to minimize lateral and rotational movement during hopping. The one living genus that deviates from this pattern is Dendrolagus, which contains the tree kangaroos of New Guinea and extreme northeastern Australia. They descended from ground dwelling ancestors by ascending into the trees. Tree kangaroos can hop bipedally as well as move their hindlimbs alternately. In a paper published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, the researchers presented the first published skeletal description of an extinct Australian macropodine that is not a tree kangaroo. The specimens we analyzed suggest this species would climb and move slowly through trees, Dr. Warburton said. The team examined several cranial specimens and two near complete\\xa0kangaroo skeletons, a male and a female, from the Thylacoleo Caves of the Nullarbor Plain in south central Australia. The Thylacoleo Caves are famous for both the remarkably complete preservation of the fossil remains and the insights they provide into the unexpectedly high level of diversity of large marsupial species that inhabited what is now an arid treeless plain, Professor Prideaux said. Despite purportedly being an expert in fossil kangaroos, it took me most of that time to work out that these two skeletons belonged to a species first described decades earlier from jaw fragments from a cave in southwestern Australia. By undertaking a painstaking process of identifying and describing the anatomical details of every single bone that was recovered from the skeletons, we have been able to reveal that this species of extinct\\xa0kangaroo was adapted for climbing trees in order to browse on plant material not available to animals that are stuck on the ground, Dr. Warburton said. This extinct species was first described as Wallabia kitcheneri in 1989 from Pleistocene deposits of Mammoth Cave in southwestern Australia. Professor Prideaux and Dr. Warburton reallocated it to the previously monotypic genus Congruus. These fossils have unusually long fingers and toes with long, curved claws, in comparison to other kangaroos and wallabies, for gripping powerful arm muscles to raise and hold themselves up in trees, and a longer, more mobile neck than other kangaroos that would be useful for reaching out the head in different directions for browsing on leaves, Dr. Warburton said. This is really interesting, not just from the point of view of unexpected tree climbing behavior in a large kangaroo, but also as these specimens come from an area that is now bare of trees, and so tells us that the habitat and environment in the area were really different to what they are now, and perhaps different to what we might have previously interpreted for that time. This is unexpected and exciting and it provides us with new information as we try to understand the changing environments of Australia through time. '}, {'title': ' Cretaceous Plankton-Eating Shark Had Long, Wing-Like Fins', 'author': 'Enrico de Lazaro', 'date': 'Mar 19, 2021', 'doc': 'A new species of shark with hypertrophied, slender pectoral fins has been identified from the fossilized remains discovered in northern Mexico. The newly identified shark species, named Aquilolamna milarcae, swam in the Late Cretaceous oceans, approximately 93 million years ago. The complete specimen was found in 2012 in Vallecillo, Mexico, a locality yielding remarkably preserved fossils, said lead author Dr. Romain Vullo from the University of Rennes and the CNRS and colleagues. This site, already famous for its many fossils of ammonites, bony fish and other marine reptiles, is most useful for documenting the evolution of oceanic animals. Aquilolamna milarcae belongs to Lamniformes, an order of sharks in the subclass Elasmobranchii. Elasmobranchs are the highly successful group of cartilaginous fishes, including sharks, skates and rays, the paleontologists said. They first appeared in Earths oceans roughly 380 million years ago and have since evolved to fill a diverse array of ecological roles. Modern plankton feeding elasmobranchs are characterized by two distantly related clades  those with a more traditional shark like body shape, such as whale and basking sharks, and those with the sleek, flattened bodies and winglike fins of Mobulidae rays. Standing out among both living and fossil planktivorous plankton eating sharks and rays, Aquilolamna milarcae resides somewhere in between. Aquilolamna milarcae had many features similar to modern manta rays, notably long, slender fins and a mouth adapted to filter feeding, suggesting that it was planktivorous. It had a caudal fin with a well developed superior lobe, typical of most pelagic sharks, such as whale sharks and tiger sharks, Dr. Vullo said. Thus, its anatomical features thus give it a chimeric appearance that combines both sharks and rays. With its large mouth and supposed very small teeth, it must have fed on plankton.  Aquilolamna milarcae was a relatively slow swimmer, using both its long pectoral fins and tail to glide through the water while scooping up suspended plankton using its large, gaping mouth. Its body plan represents an unexpected evolutionary experimentation with underwater flight among sharks, more than 30 million years before the rise of Mobulidae rays, and shows that winglike pectoral fins have evolved independently in two distantly related clades of filter feeding elasmobranches, the researchers said. The discovery of Aquilolamna milarcae is reported in a paper in the journal Science. '}, {'title': ' Pollen-Feeding Flies Pollinated Flowers 47 Million Years Ago', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Mar 17, 2021', 'doc': 'Hirmoneura messelense, a newly described species of nemestrinid fly that lived approximately 47.5 million years ago Eocene period, pollinated flowers of at least two plant genera. Bees, bumblebees, and butterflies are widely known pollinators of flowering plants who, to some degree, also feed on pollen, said Dr. Sonja Wedmann, a researcher at the Senckenberg Research Institute and the Natural History Museum in Frankfurt. Yet, it is often ignored that flies also play an important role in this regard. Our latest research results show that dipterans fed on pollen as long as approximately 50 million years ago Dr. Wedmann and her colleagues analyzed the contents of the conspicuously swollen abdomen of Hirmoneura messelense, which was discovered at the famous Messel Pit paleontological site near Darmstadt in Germany. They found pollen grains from at least four plant families Lythraceae, Vitaceae, Sapotaceae, and Oleaceae mainly from two extant plant genera Decodon water willows and Parthenocissus Virginia creepers. This is the first indication that flies from the family Nemestrinidae fed on pollen in the past  and possibly continue to do so until today, Dr. Wedmann said. Such fossil food remnants are extremely rare on a global scale, she added. They allow inferences as to the animals lifestyle and feeding behavior as well as the environmental conditions under which the animals lived at the time. The large volume of Parthenocissus pollen supports the hypothesis that Hirmoneura messelense fed on plants that grew along the edge of an ancient forest and the Messel lake. The flies undoubtedly avoided long distance flights between their food plants to save energy, Dr. Wedmann said. We therefore assume that the plants associated with the pollen could be found within a relatively small area. We assume that the flies played an important role in transporting the pollen, and thus in the propagation of several plant families, she concluded. It is possible that flies were  and still are  more important than bees for the pollination of tropical plants. The findings were published in the journal Current Biology.

Ice sheets typically pulverize and destroy everything in their path, but what we discovered was delicate plant structures  perfectly preserved, said Dr. Andrew Christ, a researcher in the Department of Geology and the Gund Institute for Environment at the University of Vermont. Theyre fossils, but they look like they died yesterday. Its a time capsule of what used to live on Greenland that we wouldnt be able to find anywhere else. Dr. Christ and colleagues analyzed sediment at the bottom of the Camp Century ice core, collected 120 km\\xa075 miles from the coast in northwestern Greenland. The subglacial sediment from the Camp Century ice core was collected in 1966, they explained. The sediment was stored frozen, initially at University at Buffalo from 1966, until it was transferred to Niels Bohr Institute in 1994 and 1996. The sediment, frozen under nearly 1.4 km\\xa00.9. miles of ice, contained well preserved fossil plants and biomolecules sourced from at least two ice free warm periods in the past few million years. We used a series of advanced analytical techniques  none of which were available to researchers fifty years ago  to probe the sediment, fossils, and the waxy coating of leaves found at the bottom of the Camp Century ice core, the scientists said. For example, we measured ratios of rare isotopes of both aluminum and the element beryllium that form in quartz only when the ground is exposed to the sky and can be hit by cosmic rays. Another test used rare forms of oxygen, found in the ice within the sediment, to reveal that precipitation must have fallen at much lower elevations than the height of the current ice sheet, demonstrating ice sheet absence. The authors concluded that the Greenland Ice Sheet persisted through much of the Pleistocene but melted and reformed at least once since 1.1 million years ago. Our study shows that Greenland is much more sensitive to natural climate warming than we used to think  and we already know that humanitys out of control warming of the planet hugely exceeds the natural rate, Dr. Christ said. Greenland may seem far away, but it can quickly melt, pouring enough into the oceans that New York, Miami, Dhaka  pick your city  will go underwater, added Dr. Paul Bierman, a researcher in the Department of Geology, the Gund Institute for Environment, and the Rubenstein School of the Environment and Natural Resources at the University of Vermont. '}, {'title': ' Jurassic Gliding Mammal Relative Sheds New Light on Evolution of Mammalian Middle Ear', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Mar 16, 2021', 'doc': 'Paleontologists from the United States and China have examined the middle ear bones ossicles of Vilevolodon diplomylos, a gliding haramiyidan that lived during the Middle Jurassic epoch, some 160 million years ago, and found them remarkably similar to those of modern monotremes egg laying mammals. Paleontologists know that the three ossicles  the malleus, incus and stapes  in extant mammals close non mammal relatives were attached to the lower jaw and functioned with it, serving in both chewing and hearing. In many mammal lineages, these bones eventually detached from the lower jaw and came to serve only auditory functions. The details of this transition have been mysterious. In the new research, Professor Shundong Bi from Yunnan University and the Indiana University of Pennsylvania and colleagues analyzed computed tomographic CT images of the well preserved malleus and incus of Vilevolodon diplomylos. They found the ancient animals malleus and incus remarkably similar to those of modern monotremes. Since haramiyidans and monotremes are not thought to be closely related, this resemblance demonstrates a surprising instance of convergent evolution. Although separated by 160 million years of geologic time, it is remarkable how similar these bones are in Vilevolodon diplomylos and the living monotremes, the platypus and echidna, said Dr. John Wible, a researcher at Yunnan University and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The preservation of these ossicles in the fossil is amazing the incus is just a little over a millimeter across The malleus and incus of monotremes have long been considered to be unique adaptations as they are wholly unlike these bones in the remaining living mammals, marsupials and placentals. This type of malleus and incus represent an evolutionary stage between fossils with ossicles attached to and functioning with the lower jaw and those where the ossicles are detached from the lower jaw and exclusively function for hearing, the researchers said. We hope the discovery advances the understanding of how mammals, including humans, developed their unique sense of hearing. The results were published in the journal Nature. '}, {'title': ' New Elasmosaurid Plesiosaur Unearthed in Chile', 'author': 'Enrico de Lazaro', 'date': 'Mar 15, 2021', 'doc': 'A new genus and species of aristonectine elasmosaurid plesiosaur has been described from a partial skeleton found in central Chile. The newly discovered plesiosaur lived approximately 67 million years ago during the Maastrichtian stage of the Cretaceous period. Dubbed Wunyelfia maulensis, the animal belongs to Aristonectinae, a group of plesiosaurs in the family Elasmosauridae. It is only the second representative of this group known to date in the southeastern Pacific during the late Maastrichtian stage. The Aristonectinae was a monophyletic lineage of elasmosaurid plesiosaurs morphologically and ecologically distinct from other typically long necked elasmosaurids, said University of Chile paleontologists Dr. Rodrigo Otero and Dr. Sergio Soto Acuña. The first were characterized by the acquisition of enlarged skulls, an increased tooth number, as well as shortened and thickened necks, which spanned mostly along the Weddellian Province during the Late Cretaceous. They are frequent in the Maastrichtian of the southern hemisphere, with occurrences in Argentinean Patagonia, central and southern Chile, New Zealand and Antarctica. The growing body of evidence currently shows that among austral elasmosaurid plesiosaurs, at least one monophyletic lineage Aristonectinae reached a provincial diversity with endemic forms in Antarctica, New Zealand and southern South America during the Late Cretaceous. The near adult, partial postcranial skeleton of Wunyelfia maulensis was recovered from the upper Maastrichtian levels of the Quiriquina Formation in central Chile. The studied skeleton was recovered from strata exposed in the locality of Mariscadero, south of Pelluhue, 320 km 199 miles southwest from Santiago, the researchers explained. The specimen was found 20 cm 7.9 inches above a second partial postcranial skeleton of an indeterminate elasmosaurid. Its small almost adult size differs from coeval larger forms previously described in South America, particularly Aristonectes parvidens and Aristonectes quiriquinensis, with estimated lengths over 10 m 33 feet, they noted. Aristonectines seem to have exploited a unique trophic niche unrecorded among other plesiosaurs. The presence of Aristonectes and Wunyelfia during the late Maastrichtian of central Chile may correlate with a highly productive ecosystem able to support a taxonomic diversity within this distinctive ecomorphotype, the scientists said. Further studies on this new taxon and other early aristonectines will be key to understanding the origin and evolution of this singular clade of elasmosaurids. The discovery is reported in a paper in the February 2021 issue of the journal Cretaceous Research. '}, {'title': ' Devonian Lamprey Hatchling-to-Adult Growth Series Sheds New Light on Vertebrate Origins', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Mar 12, 2021', 'doc': 'Paleontologists from Canada, the United States and South Africa have unearthed the fossilized remains of larval and juvenile forms of four lamprey species that lived during the Paleozoic era, including a hatchling to adult growth series of the lamprey genus Priscomyzon from the Late Devonian of Gondwana. The discovery is overturning long held ideas as to what modern lampreys may tell us about the origin of vertebrates. Lampreys are an extremely primitive lineage of jawless fish. They are found in temperate regions around the world, except Africa, and live mostly in coastal and fresh waters, although some species travel significant distances in the open ocean. They feed by latching onto other fish with a sucker around their mouth, securing their grip with circles of teeth and then drinking their victims blood after rasping a hole with special teeth on their tongue. Until now, it was commonly believed that modern lampreys were swimming time capsules that could give unique insights into the biology and genome of a truly ancient lineage. This belief was supported by the discovery of Priscomyzon riniensis, a lamprey species that lived 360 million years ago in what is now South Africa. The discovery was met with excitement worldwide as it was the oldest lamprey ever found, yet it appeared to have been essentially almost identical to modern adult lampreys. In many ways, modern lampreys indeed provide unique insights into their ancient ancestry. But new evidence shows that this is not the case when it comes to the juvenile larval stage. Lampreys and modern hagfish are the only jawless fish alive that branched off from the family tree of vertebrates before they got jaws, said Dr. Rob Gess, a paleontologist at the Albany Museum and the Department of Geology at Rhodes University. This makes them very interesting for researchers attempting to understand the earliest stages of vertebrate history. Called ammocoetes, the blind, filter feeding, worm like larvae of modern lampreys burrow in stream beds and filter water for minute food particles before slowly transforming into free swimming, eyed, actively feeding adults. Crucially, this strange life history was thought to echo transformations some 500 million years ago, which gave rise to all fish lineages, including the one that ultimately led to humans. Hence, the last invertebrate ancestor of vertebrates is often portrayed as ammocoete like, and the earliest vertebrate as being lamprey like. But for this to be a reasonable model, both ammocoetes and lampreys would need to hark back to the dawn of vertebrate history. Now, for the first time, the conventional wisdom that our long chain of ancestors included an ammocoete like form can be directly tested, and the evidence strongly contradicts such an assumption, Dr. Gess said. Lampreys are virtually never fossilized as they had no bones or spines and just minute teeth, but in the 360 million old Waterloo Farm black shales near Makhanda Grahamstown in South Africas Eastern Cape province, impressions of their soft bodies are preserved as silvery white films in the black shale. Details of their cartilaginous skeletons show through like X rays. This is incredibly special. Nowhere else in the world are such ancient lamprey remains found. Painstaking excavation of these shale samples has revealed the growth series of Priscomyzon illustrating its development from hatchling to adult, he said. Remarkably, the smallest preserved individual, barely 15 mm in length, still carried a yolk sac. This signals that they had only just hatched before entering the fossil record. Of crucial importance even the hatchlings were already sighted with large eyes and armed with a toothed sucker, much like the blood sucking adult phase of modern lampreys and completely unlike their modern ammocoete counterparts. This drastically different structure of ancient lamprey infants provides evidence that modern lamprey larvae are not evolutionary relics. Rather, the modern filter feeding phase is a more recent innovation that allowed lampreys to populate and thrive in rivers and lakes. Less complete and previously unpublished partial growth series of three types of slightly younger lampreys from North America support the finding. Distant human ancestry seemingly did not include a lamprey larva like stage, he concluded. Lampreys now appear to be a highly evolved side branch which shared a common ancestor with us probably a jawless fish enclosed in bony armor. The findings are published in the journal Nature.

Although their diversity and distribution are well known, their place on the plant family tree remained enigmatic because their anatomy was unknown. In new research, paleobiologists in China discovered and reconstructed a new species of noeggerathialean tree that existed 298 million years ago during the Permian period their analysis shows that Noeggerathiales are more closely related to seed plants than to other fern groups. Noeggerathiales were recognized as early as the 1930s, but scientists have treated them as a taxonomic football, endlessly kicked around without anyone identifying their place in the Story of Life, said Dr. Jason Hilton, a paleobiologist at the Institute of Forest Research at the University of Birmingham. The spectacular fossil plants found in China are becoming renowned as the plant equivalent of Pompeii. Thanks to this slice of life preserved in volcanic ash, we were able to reconstruct a new species of Noeggerathiales that finally settles the groups affinity and evolutionary importance. The fate of the Noeggerathiales is a stark reminder of what can happen when even very advanced life forms are faced with rapid environmental change. Dr. Hilton and colleagues uncovered the fossilized remains of a new noeggerathialean species  named Paratingia wuhaia  within a 66 cm thick volcanic ash fall horizon previously termed the Chinese vegetational Pompeii at Wuda open coalmine, Inner Mongolia, China. They found that Noeggerathiales are in fact advanced tree ferns that evolved complex cone like structures from modified leaves. Despite their sophistication, they fell victim to the profound environmental and climate changes of 251 million years ago that destroyed swamp ecosystems globally. Many specimens were identified in excavations in 2006 2007 when a few leaves were visible on the surface of the ash, said Professor Jun Wang, a paleobiologist at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. It looked they might be connected to each other and a stem below  we revealed the crown on site, but then extracted the specimens complete to take them back to the lab. It has taken many years to study these fully and the additional specimens we have found more recently. The complete trees are the most impressive fossil plants I have seen and because of our careful work they are also some of the most important to science. The results were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. '}, {'title': ' Paleontologists Find Remains of Oviraptorid Dinosaur and Embryo-Bearing Egg Clutch', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Mar 10, 2021', 'doc': 'Paleontologists in China have discovered what they say is the first non avialan dinosaur fossil known to preserve an adult skeleton atop an egg clutch that contains embryonic remains. Dinosaurs preserved on their nests are rare, and so are fossil embryos, said Dr. Shundong Bi, a paleontologist in the Centre for Vertebrate Evolutionary Biology at the Yunnan Universitys Institute of Palaeontology and the Department of Biology at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania. This is the first time a non avian dinosaur has been found, sitting on a nest of eggs that preserve embryos, in a single spectacular specimen. The 70 million year old fossil was recovered from the Upper Cretaceous Nanxiong Formation near the Ganzhou railway station of Ganzhou city, Jiangxi Province, China. The specimen is a partial skeleton of a medium sized oviraptorid theropod preserved atop an undisturbed clutch of at least 24 eggs, some of which are broken, exposing embryonic bones. The eggs are 21.5 cm in length and 8.5 cm in width across their equatorial regions. The outer surface of all eggs exhibits ornamentation made up of fine, densely packed ridges approximately 2 3 mm in width. Embryonic material is exposed in seven eggs, but ossified bones with identifiable morphologies are observed only in four eggs. The late stage of development of the embryos and the close proximity of the adult to the eggs strongly suggests that the latter died in the act of incubating its nest, like its modern bird cousins, rather than laying its eggs or simply guarding its nest crocodile style. This kind of discovery, in essence fossilized behavior, is the rarest of the rare in dinosaurs, said Dr. Matthew Lamanna, a researcher in the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Though a few adult oviraptorids have been found on nests of their eggs before, no embryos have ever been found inside those eggs. In the new specimen, the babies were almost ready to hatch, which tells us beyond a doubt that this oviraptorid had tended its nest for quite a long time. This dinosaur was a caring parent that ultimately gave its life while nurturing its young. The researchers also conducted oxygen isotope analyses that indicate that the eggs were incubated at high, bird like temperatures, adding further support to the hypothesis that the adult perished in the act of brooding its nest. Moreover, although all embryos were well developed, some appear to have been more mature than others. This suggests that oviraptorid eggs in the same clutch might have hatched at slightly different times. Known as asynchronous hatching, this characteristic appears to have evolved independently in oviraptorids and some modern birds. Another interesting aspect of the specimen is that the adult preserves a cluster of gastroliths stomach stones in its abdominal region. This is the first time that undoubted gastroliths have been found in an oviraptorid, and as such, these stones may provide new insights into the diets of these animals. Its extraordinary to think how much biological information is captured in just this single fossil, said Dr. Xing Xu, a researcher at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology and the Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Were going to be learning from this specimen for many years to come. The findings appear in the journal Science Bulletin. '}, {'title': ' New Bird-Like Dinosaur Identified in Spain', 'author': 'Enrico de Lazaro', 'date': 'Mar 8, 2021', 'doc': 'A new genus and species of troodontid dinosaur that lived 66 million years ago at the very end of the Cretaceous period has been identified from an isolated bone found in Catalonia, Spain. Tamarro insperatus lived in what is known as the Ibero Armorican island during the latest Maastrichtian age of the Cretaceous period, about 200,000 years before the end Cretaceous mass extinction. During the latest Cretaceous 77 66 million years ago in the run up to the end Cretaceous mass extinction, Europe was a series of islands populated by diverse and distinctive communities of dinosaurs and other vertebrates, said Dr. Albert Sellés, a paleontologist in the Institut Català de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafon at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona and the Museu de la Conca Dellà, and his colleagues. Many of these animals exhibited peculiar features that may have been generated by lack of space and resources in their insular habitats. Tamarro insperatus was a type of troodontid Troodontidae, a group of bird like theropod dinosaurs that includes kiwi size i.e. 0.8 kg for Mei long to rhea size species i.e. 47 kg for Troodon formosus. The presence of troodontids in Europe has been debated for a long time, mainly because its record was entirely based on isolated teeth, until now, the paleontologists said. The oldest troodontid evidence in Europe dates back to the Early Cenomanian age 100 94 million years ago and is based on the discovery of one isolated tooth in western France. The discovery of Tamarro insperatus in the latest Maastrichtian deposits from southern Pyrenees represents the first unequivocal bone evidence of this group of small sized non avian theropods in Europe, and confirms the occurrence of troodontids in the theropod faunal assemblage of that continent. The 66 million year old isolated bone of Tamarro insperatus was discovered in September 2003 by a team of paleontologists from the Museu de la Conca Dellà at the site of Sant Romà dAbella in Catalonia, Spain. Its unique combination of anatomical characters allows its identification as a new species, the researchers said. Furthermore, its histology shows a growth pattern in which it grew fast in early ontogeny but reached subadult size quickly. According to the authors, Tamarro insperatus appeared within the faunal turnover on the Ibero Armorican island in the early Maastrichtian age, which helps define the origins and timings of the migratory waves that brought the newcomers to the European archipelago. We hypothesize that it could have migrated from Asia to reach the Ibero Armorican island no later than Cenomanian or during the Maastrichtian dispersal events, they said. The teams paper was published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The remains of Pleistocene megafauna, including proboscideans elephant like animals, are well documented in northeastern North America, but well dated finds are rare in New England with only eight examples in the region and none from the state of Vermont. The Mount Holly mammoth discovered during railroad construction in the summer of 1848 is the most complete and best documented set of proboscidean remains from Vermont, but remained undated. One molar, two tusks, and an unknown number of bones were excavated from a hilltop bog near Mount Holly. It has long been thought that megafauna and humans in New England did not overlap in time and space and that it was probably ultimately environmental change that led to the extinction of these animals in the region but our research provides some of the first evidence that they may have actually co existed, said Dartmouth College researchers Dr. Nathaniel Kitchel and Dr. Jeremy DeSilva. The researchers goal was to obtain a radiocarbon date for the fragmentary rib bone of the Mount Holly mammoth. They took a 3D scan of the material prior to taking a small one gram sample from the broken end of the rib bone. They then sent the sample to the Center for Applied Isotope Studies at the University of Georgia for radiocarbon dating and a stable istotopic analysis. The Mount Holly mammoth was one of the last known occurring mammoths in the Northeast, Dr. DeSilva said. The radiocarbon date for the fossil of 12,800 years old overlaps with the accepted age of when humans may have initially settled in the region, which is thought to have occurred during the start of the Younger Dryas. The findings were published in the journal Boreas. '}, {'title': ' New Sauropod Dinosaur Discovered in Uzbekistan', 'author': 'Enrico de Lazaro', 'date': 'Mar 2, 2021', 'doc': 'Paleontologists have identified a new genus and species of rebbachisaurid dinosaur from a fossil uncovered in Uzbekistan. The newly discovered dinosaur roamed Earth approximately 92 million years ago, during the Turonian stage of the Late Cretaceous epoch. Dubbed Dzharatitanis kingi, it belongs to Rebbachisauridae, a large family of plant eating dinosaurs. A single isolated vertebra of the new dinosaur was recovered from the Bissekty Formation at Dzharakuduk in Navoi Viloyat, Uzbekistan. The specimen was found by paleontologists during the URBAC international expedition in 1997. This is the first rebbachisaurid reported from Asia and one of the youngest rebbachisaurids in the known fossil record, Dr. Alexander Averianov of St. Petersburg Zoological Institute and Dr. Hans Dieter Sues of Smithsonian Institution wrote in their paper. The Rebbachisauridae is the second sauropod group identified in the assemblage of non avian dinosaurs from the Bissekty Formation, in addition to a previously identified indeterminate titanosaurian. All previous records of rebbachisaurid dinosaurs came from a narrow band extending from southernmost South America through the northeastern South America and northwestern Africa to Europe. The discovery of Dzharatitanis kingi now considerably extends the known distribution of this group to the east. It is most likely that these dispersed to Central Asia from Europe but it is not clear when this could have occurred. The Rebbachisauridae possibly dispersed from Europe to Asia via a land bridge across the Turgai Strait sometime between the Barremian and Turonian, the paleontologists wrote. The discovery is reported in a paper published this month in the journal PLoS ONE. '}, {'title': ' 65-Million-Year-Old Primate Fossils Uncovered in Montana', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Mar 1, 2021', 'doc': 'Paleontologists in the United States have discovered and analyzed the fossilized remains from two species of Purgatorius, the oldest genus in a group of the earliest known primates called Plesiadapiformes. Plesiadapiformes first appeared during the Paleocene epoch, between 65 and 55 million years ago, although many were extinct by the beginning of the Eocene epoch. These ancient primates were small bodied and ate specialized diets of insects and fruits that varied by species. They are crucial to understanding the evolutionary and ecological origins of primates, treeshrews, and colugos as well as the traits that separate those groups from other mammals. Five new isolated plesiadapiform teeth were recovered from the Harleys Point locality of the Fort Union Formation in northeastern Montana. The fossils are estimated to be 65.9 million years old, about 105,000 to 139,000 years after the end Cretaceous mass extinction event. Two three from the sample are from a previously known species of plesiadapiform called Purgatorius janisae. Three other specimens represent a new species named Purgatorius mckeeveri. Its mind blowing to think of our earliest archaic primate ancestors, said co lead author Professor Wilson Mantilla, a vertebrate paleontologist in the Department of Biology at the University of Washington and the Department of Paleontology at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. They were some of the first mammals to diversify in this new post mass extinction world, taking advantage of the fruits and insects up in the forest canopy. Based on the age of the fossils, Professor Mantilla and colleagues estimate that the ancestor of all primates  including plesiadapiforms and todays primates  likely emerged by the Late Cretaceous epoch and lived alongside large dinosaurs. This was a really cool study to be a part of, particularly because it provides further evidence that the earliest primates originated before the extinction of non avian dinosaurs, said co author Brody Hovatter, a graduate student in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington. They became highly abundant within a million years after that extinction. This discovery is exciting because it represents the oldest dated occurrence of archaic primates in the fossil record, added co lead author Dr. Stephen Chester, a researcher at Brooklyn College and the City University of New York. It adds to our understanding of how the earliest primates separated themselves from their competitors following the demise of the dinosaurs. The research was published in the journal Royal Society Open Science. '}, {'title': ' Paleontologists Discover Oldest Known Titanosaur', 'author': 'Enrico de Lazaro', 'date': 'Mar 1, 2021', 'doc': 'Ninjatitan zapatai lived approximately 140 million years ago Early Cretaceous epoch in what is now Patagonia, Argentina. Ninjatitan zapatai belongs to Titanosauria, a diverse group of sauropod long necked plant eating dinosaurs. This group includes species ranging from the largest known terrestrial vertebrates to dwarfs no bigger than elephants. During evolutionary history, sauropods had different moments, different pulses of gigantism, which were not only related to the group of titanosaurs, said Dr. Pablo Ariel Gallina, a paleontologist at the Fundación Azara in Maimonides University and CONICET. There were large animals towards the end of the Jurassic period, such as Apatosaurus and Brachiosaurus. And, already in the line of titanosaurs, the pulse with the largest giants occurs towards the middle of the Cretaceous period, with species such as Patagotitan, Argentinosaurus or Notocolossus. Ninjatitan zapatai was about 20 m 66 feet in length, and had a long neck and tail. The main importance of Ninjatitan zapatai, beyond the fact that it is a new species of titanosaur, is that it is the earliest record worldwide for this group, Dr. Gallina said. This discovery is also very important for the knowledge of the evolutionary history of sauropods, because the fossil records of the Early Cretaceous epoch, in around 140 million years ago, are really very scarce throughout the world. The 140 million year old postcranial remains of Ninjatitan zapatai were discovered in the Bajada Colorada Formation in Neuquén province, Patagonia region, Argentina. The presence of a basal titanosaurian sauropod in the lowermost Cretaceous of Patagonia supports the hypothesis that the group was established in the southern hemisphere and reinforces the idea of a Gondwanan origin for Titanosauria, the researchers said. The discovery of Ninjatitan zapatai is described in a paper in the journal Ameghiniana. '}, {'title': ' Geologists Find Asteroid Dust inside Chicxulub Impact Crater', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Feb 25, 2021', 'doc': 'Geologists believe they have closed the case of what killed non avian dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period. About 66 million years ago, the end Cretaceous mass extinction eradicated roughly 75 of the animal and plant species on Earth, including whole groups like non avian dinosaurs and ammonites. In the geologic record, this extinction event is marked by a thin layer of clay with elevated concentrations of iridium  a metal that occurs in higher concentrations in meteorites but only in low concentrations in Earths crust. First detected in Gubbio, Italy, and Caravaca, Spain, in the 1980s, the iridium layer was used to propose a large scale impact of an extraterrestrial body as the cause for the end Cretaceous extinction. In the 1990s, high energy deposits were identified around the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, culminating in the discovery of the 180  to 200 km wide Chicxulub crater on the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. In a new study, an international team of researchers found iridium in drill core recovered by IODP ICDP Expedition 364 from the Chicxulub impact structure. In the crater, the sediment layer deposited in the days to years after the strike is so thick that the scientists were able to precisely date the dust to a mere two decades after impact. The circle is now finally complete, said Professor Steven Goderis, a researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. We are now at the level of coincidence that geologically doesnt happen without causation, said Professor Sean Gulick, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. It puts to bed any doubts that the iridium anomaly in the geologic layer is not related to the Chicxulub crater. The highest concentrations of iridium were found within a 5 cm section of the rock core retrieved from the top of the Chicxulub craters peak ring. In addition to iridium, the crater section showed elevated levels of other elements associated with asteroid material. This asteroid was vaporized and ejected from the impact site at high speed, said Professor Joanna Morgan, a researcher at Imperial College London. Iridium, and other asteroidal material, then circled the Earth above the stratosphere within a fast moving dust cloud, and may have taken up to two decades to settle through the atmosphere and ocean before being deposited at the impact site. We combined the results from four independent laboratories around the world to make sure we got this right, Professor Goderis said. The findings appear in the journal Science Advances. '}, {'title': ' 360,000-Year-Old DNA Sheds New Light on Evolutionary History of Cave Bears', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Feb 25, 2021', 'doc': 'An international team of researchers has extracted and sequenced DNA from a 360,000 year old petrous bone of the extinct cave bear Ursus kudarensis found in a cave in the Caucasus Mountains  the oldest genome sequence from a non permafrost environment. Using this and other cave bear genomes, theyve determined nuclear and mitochondrial substitution rates and revised the evolutionary history of cave bears. The fossil analyzed by the team belongs to a Middle Pleistocene cave bear subspecies called Ursus kudarensis praekudarensis, which is thought to be ancestral to the Late Pleistocene Caucasian cave bear Ursus kudarensis kudarensis. The specimen was found in Kudaro 1 cave located in the Southern Caucasus in South Ossetia, Georgia. Our analysis of the whole genome data has revealed a new evolutionary history for cave bears, said Dr. Axel Barlow, a researcher at Nottingham Trent University and the University of Potsdam. He and his colleagues produced billions of individual short DNA sequences which represented a mixture of DNA from the cave bear and contaminants the bone had picked up over hundreds of thousands of years. Our study shows that this amazing molecule can survive even longer than previously thought, opening up new opportunities for genetic investigation over previously unimaginable timescales, Dr. Barlow said. We analyzed a petrous bone that was around seven times older than any we had previously studied, showing that genome data can be recovered from temperate zone samples spanning more than 300,000 years. To put this in context, this cave bear probably lived before our own species, Homo sapiens, even came into existence. The scientists then used computational analysis to sort the target sequences from the contamination, which is done my matching the short sequences to a reference genome of a related organism, in this case the polar bear. From a total of 2.6 billion sequenced molecules, we were able to map 2.1 Gb of sequence with high confidence to the reference genome assembly of the polar bear, they explained. In order to learn more about the evolution of cave bears, once they had the genome data for Ursus kudarensis praekudarensis, they were able to compare with others from between 35,000 and 70,000 years ago to provide broad sampling of all the major cave bear lineages. Because the time difference between the cave bear samples was so great, they were able to count how many DNA mutations had occurred during this period. From here they could calculate the rate of DNA mutation in the cave bear genome, as well as the time that the different lineages diverged. Using the newly calculated mutation rate, they found that cave bears and their living relatives  the brown bear and polar bear  diverged from a common ancestor about 1.5 million years ago. And while they had previously shown that cave bears interbred with brown bears, with the mutation rate they are now able to date these events. The authors found that cave bears exchanged mitochondrial DNA frequently during their evolution, which until now had obscured their true evolutionary relationships. They also found that many significant events in bear evolution may have been driven by major global climate change about one million years ago, when cold phases became longer and more intense and warm phases much shorter. We have been able to determine the mutation rate of the cave bear genome for the first time, Dr. Barlow said. Using this information, we have discovered that major climatic changes may have been a factor driving major evolutionary events in these giant bears. A paper on the findings was published in the journal Current Biology. '}, {'title': ' Researchers Sequence Mitochondrial Genome of Early Dog from Alaska', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Feb 24, 2021', 'doc': 'Scientists have extracted and sequenced mitochondrial DNA from a partial femur of an ancient dog that lived in Alaska 10,150 years ago. Their results, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, demonstrate that the animal belonged to a lineage of dogs that diverged from Siberian dogs around 16,700 years ago and may be a close relative of the earliest domesticated dogs that accompanied humans during their migrations to the New World. Pre contact American dogs arrived alongside people over 10,000 years ago and dispersed throughout North and South America. Illustration by John James Audubon and John Bachman 1845 1848. The 10,150 year old partial femur of an early dog was excavated from Lawyers Cave on the Alaskan mainland east of Wrangell Island in the Alexander Archipelago of southeast Alaska. Known as PP 00128, the specimen represents the oldest bone remains found in that cave, and is the oldest genetically confirmed dog discovered in the New World. Dr. Charlotte Lindqvist, an evolutionary biologist at the University at Buffalo, and colleagues extracted and sequenced mitochondrial genome from PP 00128 and compared it to those of modern dog breeds, historical Arctic dogs and American precontact dogs from before European arrival. Their analysis showed that the Southeast Alaskan dog shared a common ancestor about 16,000 years ago with American canines that lived before the arrival of European colonizers. We now have genetic evidence from an ancient dog found along the Alaskan coast, Dr. Lindqvist said. Because dogs are a proxy for human occupation, our data help provide not only a timing but also a location for the entry of dogs and people into the Americas. Our study supports the theory that this migration occurred just as coastal glaciers retreated during the last Ice Age. There have been multiple waves of dogs migrating into the Americas, but one question has been, when did the first dogs arrive? And did they follow an interior ice free corridor between the massive ice sheets that covered the North American continent, or was their first migration along the coast? The fossil record of ancient dogs in the Americas is incomplete, so any new remains that are found provide important clues, said Flavio Augusto da Silva Coelho, a Ph.D. student at the University at Buffalo. Before our study, the earliest ancient American dog bones that had their DNA sequenced were found in the U.S. Midwest. Carbon isotope analysis of the PP 00128 bone indicates that the dog likely had a marine diet, which may have consisted of foods such as fish and scraps from seals and whales. Canines did not arrive all at once. For example, some Arctic dogs arrived later from East Asia with the Thule culture, while Siberian huskies were imported to Alaska during the Gold Rush. Other dogs were brought to the Americas by European colonizers, Dr. Lindqvist said. Our early dog from Southeast Alaska supports the hypothesis that the first dog and human migration occurred through the Northwest Pacific coastal route instead of the central continental corridor, which is thought to have become viable only about 13,000 years ago, Coelho said. '}, {'title': ' Cretaceous-Era Coelacanths Grew As Big As Great White Sharks', 'author': 'Enrico de Lazaro', 'date': 'Feb 22, 2021', 'doc': 'Paleontologists in Morocco have unearthed a crushed ossified lung of an enormous marine coelacanth that lived during the Late Cretaceous epoch, about 66 million years ago. Coelacanths are a group of primitive deep dwelling fish closely related to tetrapods, four limbed vertebrates including amphibians, mammals and reptiles. They were thought to have been extinct for 66 million years, until the accidental capture of a living specimen by a South African fisherman in 1938. Coelacanths first appeared in the Early Devonian epoch, diversified a little in the Devonian and Carboniferous period, and attained a maximum of diversity in the Early Triassic epoch. During the Cretaceous period, they are known by two families only, the Latimeriidae, which survived to the present with the genus Latimeria, and the\\xa0Mawsoniidae, which went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous. The newly discovered specimen belongs to the latter family, and is the last record of coelacanths before their pseudo extinction 66 million years ago. The thin bony plates were arranged like a barrel, but with the staves going round instead of from top to bottom, said Professor David Martill, a paleontologist in the School of the Environment, Geography and Geosciences at the University of Portsmouth. Only one animal has such a structure and that is the coelacanth  wed found a lung of this remarkable and bizarre looking fish. The fossil was recovered from the uppermost Cretaceous deposits of Oued Zem in Morocco. It had been embedded in a block of phosphate, backed with plaster and covered in a coating of lacquer, which had caused the bones to turn brown. It was found next to a pterodactyl which proves the giant coelacanth lived in the Cretaceous period. The specimen is also the first record of a marine coelacanth in the Mesozoic of Morocco and the first occurrence of coelacanths in the phospahte deposits of North Africa, the researchers said. The large size of the lung suggests the ancient fish estimated at between 3.65 m and 5.52 m\\xa012 18 feet total body length  substantially larger than modern day coelacanths, which only grow to a maximum length of 2 m 6.6 feet. We only had a single, albeit massive lung so our conclusions required some quite complex calculations, Professor Martill said. It was astonishing to deduce that this particular fish was enormous  quite a bit longer than the length of a stand up paddleboard and likely the largest coelacanth ever discovered. The study was published in the journal Cretaceous Research. '}, {'title': ' Researchers Find Ingredients for Microbial Life in 3.5-Billion-Year-Old Rocks', 'author': 'Enrico de Lazaro', 'date': 'Feb 19, 2021', 'doc': 'A team of geobiologists from Germany has found biologically relevant primordial organic molecules and gases in fluid inclusions trapped in 3.5 billion year old barites from the Dresser mine, Marble Bar, Australia. It is widely hypothesized that primeval life utilized small organic molecules as sources of carbon and energy, said lead author Dr. Helge Mißbach from the University of Cologne and his colleagues. A potential source of these compounds includes recycled and redistributed organic matter from pre existing biomass. As yet, however, such primordial ingredients have not been found in rocks that directly testify to the emergence of life on our planet. In new research, Dr. Mißbach and co authors examined primary fluid inclusions in 3.5 billion year old barites from the Dresser Formation in Western Australia. In the field, the barites are directly associated with fossilized microbial mats, and they smell like rotten eggs when freshly scratched, they explained. To explore the full range of volatiles in the barite hosted fluid inclusions, the researchers combined gas chromatography mass spectrometry, microthermometry, fluid inclusion petrography, and stable isotope analysis. They detected various compounds such as hydrogen sulfide H2S, carbonyl sulfide COS, carbon disulfide CS2, methane CH4, acetic acid, organic poly sulfanes, and thiols. While many compounds observed are consistent with an abiotic origin, the Dresser Formation also contains a variety of evidence for life. Thus, biology is another potential source for the observed compounds, they said. In fact, organisms synthesize most lipids on modern Earth, and carbon 13 signatures of kerogen in the black barite are in good accordance with biological carbon fixation. Furthermore, compounds such as H2S, COS, CS2, methylsulfanylmethane, methyldisulfanylmethane, and thiols are typically formed during microbial sulfur cycling in modern environments, and there is isotopic evidence for the presence of sulfur processing metabolisms during Dresser times. Taken together, it is likely that the barite hosted fluid inclusions contain mixtures of various abiotic and biotic compounds. The scientists also detected stable building blocks of methyl thioacetate methanethiol, acetic acid, a putative key agent in primordial energy metabolism and thus the emergence of life. In addition to potential nutrients andor substrates, hydrothermal fluids captured in the Dresser fluid inclusions contain molecules closely related to putative key agents in the emergence of life, they said. It has been proposed that carbon monoxide CO and methanethiol can react in the presence of catalytic metallic sulfides to methyl thioacetate. This compound, also known as activated acetic acid, was proposed as being important for the formation of lipids under primordial conditions and as an energy source for early microbial metabolisms. The results reveal an intriguing diversity of organic molecules with known or inferred metabolic relevance and provide a strong clue as to how hydrothermal fluids sustained microbial life 3.5 billion years ago. The immediate connection between primordial molecules emerging from the subsurface and microbial organisms  3.5 billion years ago  somehow surprised us, Dr. Mißbach said. This finding contributes decisively to our understanding of the still unclear earliest evolutionary history of life on Earth. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. '}, {'title': ' Fossils of New Skink Species Unearthed in Australia', 'author': 'News Staff / Source', 'date': 'Feb 18, 2021', 'doc': 'A new species of extinct skink that lived during the Oligocene epoch has been identified from the fossilized remains found in South Australia. The newly identified species lived approximately 25 million years ago, making it Australias known skink. Named Proegernia mikebulli, it belongs to Egerniinae, a large subfamily of social skinks  including living bluetongues, sleepy lizards shinglebacks, land mullets and spiny tailed skinks  within the family Scincidae. The species is named after Professor Michael Bull of Flinders University, South Australia, who devoted decades to documenting the ecology of Australias egerniine skinks, said lead author Dr. Kailah Thorn, a paleoherpetologist at the South Australian Museum and Flinders University, and colleagues. Several incomplete jaws of the ancient lizard were recovered from the Namba Formation outcropping at Lake Pinpa and Billeroo Creek, seven hours drive north of capital city Adelaide. The fossiliferous deposits of this formation also bear abundant aquatic such as fish, the giant platypus Obdurodon and waterfowl and land dwelling such as possums, dasyuromorphs and skinks vertebrates. Some of Australias most famous animals, including koalas and kangaroos, had been traced back to their fossil ancestors in remarkable finds in central South Australia, Dr. Thorn said. The significance of this site containing the ancestors of Australias early marsupials was already well established, but no fossil lizards had ever been found in the Namba Formation. It was 45 degrees Celsius in the shade that day and hard work digging through the clay, but it was definitely worth it once the tiniest of bone fragments turned out to be those of the oldest Australian skink. Fossil lizards are often too small to be identified when youre in the field and lizard skulls are made of more than 20 individual bones that all disarticulate when they fossilize, Dr. Thorn added. The discovery of the tiny fossil lizards in an area the size of one million soccer fields was enabled by building an understanding of the geology of the region, and targeting bands of silt to sieve and sort back at the lab.
