Hadrosaurs, or duck billed dinosaurs, were successful herbivorous dinosaurs during the Cretaceous period. Their fossil record is known mainly from the Early Cretaceous deposits of Europe and eastern Asia, whereas derived forms are known from the Late Cretaceous rocks of all continents except Australia and the Indian subcontinent. Uniquely adapted to chewing, hadrosaurs had hundreds of closely spaced teeth in their cheeks. As their teeth wore down and fell out, new teeth in the dental battery, or rows of teeth below existing teeth, grew in as replacements. The dental structure of Yamatosaurus izanagii distinguishes it from known hadrosaurs, said Dr. Anthony Fiorillo, a paleontologist in the Institute for the Study of Earth and Man at Southern Methodist University and the Hokkaido University Museum. Unlike other hadrosaurs, the new hadrosaur has just one functional tooth in several battery positions and no branched ridges on the chewing surfaces, suggesting that it evolved to devour different types of vegetation than other hadrosaurs. Yamatosaurus izanagii also is distinguished by the development of its shoulder and forelimbs, an evolutionary step in hadrosaurids gait change from a bipedal to a quadrupedal dinosaur. The fossilized remains of the new hadrosaur  a lower jaw, teeth, neck vertebrae, shoulder bone, and tail vertebra  were found in 2014 by amateur fossil hunter Shingo Kishimoto. They were recovered from blocks of dark gray mudstones of the upper part of the Kita ama Formation exposed at a quarry in Yura Town on Japans Awaji Island. In the far north, where much of our work occurs, hadrosaurs are known as the caribou of the Cretaceous, Dr. Fiorillo said. They most likely used the Bering Land Bridge to cross from Asia to present day Alaska and then spread across North America as far east as Appalachia. The discovery of Yamatosaurus izanagii is reported in a paper in the journal Scientific Reports.

Their results indicate that this endemic represented the sister lineage to true crocodiles Crocodylus and that the ancestor of modern crocodiles likely originated in Africa. The arrival of modern humans in Madagascar between 9,000 and 2,500 years ago preceded the extinction of much of the islands vertebrate megafauna including giant tortoises, elephant birds that ranged to enormous size, dwarf hippos, and several lemur species. One lesser known extinction that occurred during this period was the demise of Voay robustus. Early explorers to the island noted that Malagasy peoples consistently referred to two types of living crocodiles on the island, a large robust crocodile and a more gracile form with a preference for rivers. This suggests that both types persisted until very recently, but only the gracile form, now recognized as an isolated population of the Nile crocodile Crocodylus niloticus, is currently found on the island. Voay robustus was hiding out on the island of Madagascar during the time when people were building the pyramids and was probably still there when pirates were getting stranded on the island, said Dr. Evon Hekkala, a researcher at Fordham University and the American Museum of Natural History. They blinked out just before we had the modern genomic tools available to make sense of the relationships of living things. And yet, they were the key to understanding the story of all the crocodiles alive today. Despite nearly 150 years of investigation, the position of Voay robustus in the tree of life has remained controversial. In 1872, French naturalists Alfred Grandidier and L\u00e9on Vaillant described it as a new species and placed it within the true crocodile group, which includes the Nile, Asian, and American crocodiles. Then, in the early part of the 20th century, it was thought that the specimens simply represented very old Nile crocodiles. And finally, in 2007, a study based on physical characteristics of the fossil specimens concluded that the horned crocodile was actually not a true crocodile, but in the group that includes dwarf crocodiles. Teasing apart the relationships of modern crocodiles is really difficult because of the physical similarities, Dr. Hekkala said. Many people dont even realize that there are multiple species of crocodiles, and they see them as this animal thats unchanging through time. But weve been trying to get to the bottom of the great diversity that exists among them. To fully examine the place of Voay robustus in the evolutionary tree, Dr. Hekkala and her colleagues made a number of attempts to sequence mitochondrial DNA from fossil specimens. This project weve tried to do on and off for many years, but the technology just hadnt advanced enough, so it always failed, said Dr. George Amato, emeritus director of the Institute for Comparative Genomics at the American Museum of Natural History. But in time, we had both the computational setup and the paleogenomic protocols that could actually fish out this DNA from the fossil and finally find a home for this species. The results place Voay robustus right next to the true crocodile branch of the evolutionary tree, making it the closest species to the common ancestor of the crocodiles alive today. This finding was surprising and also very informative to how we think about the origin of the true crocodiles found around the tropics today, Dr. Amato said. The placement of this individual suggests that true crocodiles originated in Africa and from there, some went to Asia and some went to the Caribbean and the New World. We really needed the DNA to get the correct answer to this question. The results appear in the journal Communications Biology.

Arackar licanantay lived in what is now the Atacama region of Chile during the Late Cretaceous epoch, between 84 and 66 million years ago. The species belongs to Lithostrotia, a large group of derived sauropod dinosaurs in the clade Titanosauria. The Titanosauria is very broad and diverse, with repeated finds in what is now Argentina and Brazil, said Dr. David Rubilar Rogers, a paleontologist at the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural in Chile. However, it is much less frequent to find them on this side of the mountain range. There are very few records of titanosaurs in this territory, which makes Arackar licanantay a very valuable find. The partial skeleton of Arackar licanantay, including cervical and dorsal vertebrae, humerus, femur and ischium, was recovered from the Hornitos Formation in northern Chile. It is the most complete sauropod dinosaur recorded in Chile and the south Pacific margin of South America. It is also the third dinosaur named from Chile, after Atacamatitan chilensis and Chilesaurus diegosuarezi.  Arackar licanantay is a new lithostrotian titanosaur represented by associated and disarticulated bones that belong to a single sub adult specimen of around 6.3 m 20.7 feet long, the paleontologists said. This sauropod is diagnosed by a unique association of features of dorsal vertebrae and appendicular bones. It shares some characters with Rapetosaurus and Bravasaurus, and do not belong to the derived clade Saltasaurinae from Patagonia. Another peculiarity of Arackar licanantay is related to the disposition of its limbs, said Dr. Alexander Vargas, a paleontologist at the Universidad de Chile. A characteristic of many titanosaurs is that their legs were at an open angle. The new dinosaur does not have that angle, it is quite straight compared to the femur of other titanosaurs. The teams paper was published in the journal Cretaceous Research. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Find Fossils of Extinct Giant Cloud Rats in Philippines", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 23, 2021", "doc": "Paleontologists have unearthed the 67,000 year old fossilized remains from three extinct species of giant cloud rats in several caves on the Philippine island of Luzon. Cloud rats are 18 living species of rodents with fluffy tails in the tribe Phloeomyini. They can be found in the misty mountain forests of the Philippines. They range in size from 18 g to 2.7 kg, typically live in trees, and eat leaves, buds and seeds. Their evolutionary history in the region stretches back around 14 million years, when their ancestors first arrived in the Philippine archipelago from the Asian mainland. The three newly discovered species of cloud rats  Crateromys ballik, Carpomys dakal, and Batomys cagayanensis  are thought to be extinct. Their fossils were found in Callao Cave, where a previously unknown species of human, Homo luzonensis was found in 2019, as well as smaller caves in the Cagayan province. Specimens of all three of the new species of fossil rodent were found in the same deep layer of the cave as the enigmatic Homo luzonensis indicating that they co existed some 60,000 years ago, said Professor Philip Piper, a researcher in the School of Archaeology and Anthropology at the Australian National University. Our records show they were able to adapt and survive profound climatic changes over millions of years, so the question is what might have caused their final extinction? The timing of the last recorded occurrence of two of the species might offer a clue  around 2,000 years ago or shortly after. This is after the first arrival of agricultural societies and the introduction of animals like domestic dogs, pigs and macaque monkeys to the Philippines. That seems significant, because that is roughly the same time that pottery and Neolithic stone tools first appear in the archeological record, and when dogs, domestic pigs, and probably monkeys were introduced to the Philippines, probably from Borneo, said Professor Armand Mijares, a researcher at the University of Philippines. While we cant say for certain based on our current information, this implies that humans likely played some role in their extinction. Crateromys ballik and Carpomys dakal became extinct just a few thousand years ago. They were giants among rodents, both weighing about a kilogram  big enough that it might have been worthwhile to hunt and eat them. We have had evidence of extinct large mammals on the Philippine island of Luzon for a long time, but there has been virtually no information about fossils of smaller sized mammals, said Dr. Janine Ochoa, a researcher at the University of the Philippines The reason is probably that research had focused on open air sites where the large fossil mammal faunas were known to have been preserved, rather than the careful sieving of cave deposits that preserve a broader size range of vertebrates including the teeth and bones of rodents. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the Philippines has the greatest concentration of unique species of mammals of any country, most of which are small animals, less than half a pound, that live in the tropical forest, said Dr. Larry Heaney, a researcher at Field Museum. These recently extinct fossil species not only show that biodiversity was even greater in the very recent past, but that the two that became extinct just a few thousand years ago were giants among rodents, both weighing more than two pounds. By comparing the fossils to the 18 living cloud rat species, the scientists have a decent idea of what Crateromys ballik, Carpomys dakal and Batomys cagayanensis would have looked like. The bigger ones would have looked almost like a woodchuck with a squirrel tail, Dr. Heaney said. Cloud rats eat plants, and theyve got great big pot bellies that allow them to ferment the plants that they eat, kind of like cows. They have big fluffy or furry tails. Theyre really quite cute. The findings were published in the Journal of Mammalogy. "}, {"title": " Young Tyrannosaurs Had More Slender Feet than Adults, Study Finds", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 23, 2021", "doc": "An international team of paleontologists has examined a collection of 72.5 million year old tyrannosaur  probably Albertosaurus  footprints from the Wapiti Formation of Alberta, Canada, to learn more about the way these predatory dinosaurs aged and how they moved. Fossil footprints have long been used to infer aspects of the biology of non avian dinosaurs that are not readily apparent from skeletal remains, including estimated speeds and inferred social behaviors. The footprints can be ambiguous and hard to interpret correctly  the shape of a footprint may be influenced by the type of ground surface that is stepped on and the motions of the animal making the footprints. In addition, the exact identity of the animal may not always be clear. These challenges have previously limited the use of fossil footprints in understanding dinosaur growth. The answer lay in the Grande Prairie region of Alberta in Canada, where University of New England Ph.D. student Nathan Enriquez and his colleagues worked with well preserved samples of footprints of different sizes that are suggested to belong to the same type of animal. We explored a remote dinosaur footprint site where we discovered a new set of large carnivorous dinosaur footprints within very similar rocks to those which have produced tyrannosaur tracks in the past, Enriquez said. Based on the relatively close proximity between these discoveries and their nearly equivalent ages  about 72.5 million years old  we suggest they may indeed belong to the same species. We were also careful to assess the quality of preservation in each footprint, and only considered specimens which were likely to reflect the shape of the actual feet that produced them. Once the paleontologists had a suitable sample, they analyzed the outlines of each specimen using a method called geometric morphometrics. This process removes the effect of overall size differences between each footprint and shows what the most important differences in track shape are. The greatest difference in shape was found to be the relative width and surface area of the heel impression, which significantly increased in size between smaller and larger footprints, Enriquez said. The smaller tracks are comparably slender, while the biggest tyrannosaur tracks are relatively broader and had much larger heel areas. This makes sense for an animal that is becoming larger and needs to support its rapidly increasing body weight. It also suggests the relative speed of these animals decreased with age. Increasingly bulky feet in the adults align with previous suggestions that juvenile tyrannosaurs would have been faster and more agile for their body size in comparison to their parents, and means that we can add footprints as another line of evidence in the debate over tyrannosaur growth. Lastly, it demonstrates the usefulness of footprints for investigating a potentially wider range of ideas about the lives of extinct species than has been considered previously. The findings were published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

It is commonly assumed that they minimize locomotor energy expenditure by selecting gait kinematics tuned to the natural frequencies of relevant body parts. In a new study, Pasha van Bijlert, a researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Naturalis Biodiversity Center, and his colleagues demonstrated that this allows estimation of the preferred step frequency and walking speed of Tyrannosaurus rex. There were already some studies investigating dinosaur walking speed, but they mostly looked at the legs and ignored the tail  which is what makes dinos so unique, Van Bijlert said. They usually found much higher walking speeds. The one we calculated is lower, but its similar to that of other animals. Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs to ever roam the Earth. The ancient animal lived in the forested river valleys of western North America between 68 and 66 million years ago Late Cretaceous epoch. It measured an average of 12 m long and 4.5 to 6 tall, had large jaws and serrated teeth. Tyrannosaurus rex didnt just have two legs, it also had an enormous tail that helped it move around. Like the bones in our necks, the bones in tails are held together by ligaments. You could compare it with a suspension bridge. A suspension bridge with a ton of muscle in it, Van Bijlert said. Every step the tail swings up and down. That means that like the swing, it has a natural frequency at which it resonates.  To find out what that frequency is, Van Bijlert and co authors built a 3D model of Trix, an individual of Tyrannosaurus rex on display at the Dutch National Museum of Natural History, Naturalis. The paleontologists added digital muscles to the famous skeleton, and on this muscular model they could perform biomechanical analyses. They determined the tail natural frequency of Tyrannosaurus rex 0.66 timess, range 0.41 0.84, and the walking speed 1.28 ms, range 0.8 1.64. Our results for preferred walking speed of Tyrannosaurus rex are lower than previous estimations for large theropods, but more closely match the preferred walking speeds of a variety of extant animals, regardless of gait pattern and body size, they said. The teams results were published in the journal Royal Society Open Science. "}, {"title": " Tyrannosaurs Lived in Groups, New Evidence Suggests", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 21, 2021", "doc": "Tyrannosaurs  theropod dinosaurs that lived in what is now North America and Asia between 100 and 66 million years ago Cretaceous period  may not have been solitary hunters as popularly envisioned. The idea that tyrannosaurs were social with complex hunting strategies was first formulated by Canadian paleontologist Professor Philip Currie in 1998. It was based on the discovery of skeletons of over 12 Albertosaurus sarcophagus individuals at a site in Alberta, Canada. The idea has been widely debated, with many paleontologists doubting the giant predators had the brainpower to organize into anything more complex than what is observed in modern crocodiles. Because the Alberta site appeared to be an isolated case, skeptics claimed it represented unusual circumstances that did not reflect normal tyrannosaur behavior. The 2005 discovery of a second tyrannosaur mass death site in Montana again raised the possibility of social tyrannosaurs, but that site was still not widely accepted by the scientific community as evidence for social behavior. Localities that produce insights into the possible behavior of extinct animals are especially rare, and difficult to interpret, Professor Currie said. In the new research, Bureau of Land Management paleontologist Alan Titus and colleagues examined a recently discovered large bonebed containing at least four individuals of the tyrannosaur species Teratophoneus curriei. Called the Rainbows and Unicorns Quarry, the site is located in the northern Kaiparowits Plateau area of Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. Using analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes and concentrations of rare earth elements within the bones and rock, the researchers found that the remains from the site all fossilized in the same environment and were not the result of an attritional assemblage of fossils washed in from a variety of areas. They concluded that a group of Teratophoneus curriei died together during a seasonal flooding event that washed their carcasses into a lake, where they sat, largely undisturbed until the river later churned its way through the bone bed. Traditional excavation techniques, supplemented by the analysis of rare earth elements, stable isotopes and charcoal concentrations convincingly show a synchronous death event at the Rainbows site of four or five tyrannosaurids, Professor Currie said. Undoubtedly, this group died together, which adds to a growing body of evidence that tyrannosaurids were capable of interacting as gregarious packs. The new Utah site adds to the growing body of evidence showing that tyrannosaurs were complex, large predators capable of social behaviors common in many of their living relatives, the birds, said Dr. Joe Sertich, curator of dinosaurs at the Denver Museum of Nature  Science. This discovery should be the tipping point for reconsidering how these top carnivores behaved and hunted across the northern hemisphere during the Cretaceous. The study was published online in the journal PeerJ.

Fossil records are incomplete, and many species of mammals, in particular those that lived at low population densities, are seldom found. For these ancient species, destructive DNA extraction from fossil remains has the potential to reveal new insights into population and evolutionary history however, it also causes irreversible damage to high value specimens. The discovery that DNA from past populations of organisms could be obtained directly from sediment, therefore, held great promise for ancient population genetics and phylogenetics. Commonly known as environmental DNA eDNA research, this approach relies on sequencing DNA fragments derived from shed cells, hair, feces, and urine preserved within sediment. Standard eDNA techniques allow species composition to be determined in the absence of macrofossils across a variety of environments including sediments, cave formations, ice cores, lakes, rivers, and oceans. To date, however, analyses of ancient eDNA have been restricted to mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA or, more recently, to short and highly diverse sequences generated using a shotgun sequencing approach. When an animal or a human urinates or defecates, cells from the organism are also excreted. And the DNA fragments from these cells are what we can detect in the soil samples, said Professor Eske Willerslev, a researcher in the Department of Zoology at the University of Cambridge and the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre at the University of Copenhagen. Using extremely powerful sequencing techniques, we reconstructed genomes  genetic profiles  based on these fragments for the first time. We have shown that hair, urine and feces all provide genetic material which, in the right conditions, can survive for much longer than 10,000 years. In the study, Professor Willerslev and his colleagues retrieved ancient genome wide data from 16,000  to 14,000 year old sediments in Chiquihuite Cave in Astillero Mountains, Mexico. Their analysis shows that the Late Pleistocene black bear population in Mexico is ancestrally related to the present day Eastern American black bear population, and that the extinct giant short faced bears present in Mexico were deeply divergent from the earlier Beringian population. The short faced bears that lived in northern Mexico were distinctly different from the population of black bears living in north western Canada, said Dr. Mikkel Winther Pedersen, a researcher in the Lundbeck Foundation GeoGenetics Centre at the GLOBE Institute at the University of Copenhagen. This is an excellent example of the new knowledge that suddenly becomes available when you reconstruct genomes based on eDNA fragments extracted from soil. All over the world, everyone scientifically involved in the study of ancient DNA recognised the need to reconstruct genomes from fragments found in soil or sediment, Professor Willerslev said. Being able to do that for the first time means we have opened up a new frontier. Analysis of DNA found in soil could have the potential to expand the narrative about everything from the evolution of species to developments in climate change  this is the moon landing of genomics because fossils will no longer be needed. A paper describing the research was published in the journal Current Biology. "}, {"title": " How Many Tyrannosaurus rex Individuals Ever Roamed Earth?", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 16, 2021", "doc": "Paleontologists estimate that the abundance of one of the best known dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus rex, at any one time was about 20,000 individuals, that the species persisted for 127,000 generations, and that the total number of Tyrannosaurus rex that ever lived was 2.5 billion individuals. Much can be learned from the fossil record about extinct species like the dinosaurs. However, due to the records fragmented nature, understanding ecological variables such as population density and abundance remains challenging. In living species, one way to understand more about these variables is by using the established relationship between population density and body mass, or Damuths Law, which states that the average population density of a species decreases with body size at a predictable rate. Using this law and the large body of paleontological data for Tyrannosaurus rex, Professor Charles Marshall from the University of California Museum of Paleontology and his colleagues estimated population level traits and the rate of fossil preservation for the species. The researchers mined the scientific literature for data they used to estimate that the likely age at sexual maturity of a Tyrannosaurus rex was 15.5 years its maximum lifespan was probably into its late 20s and its average body mass as an adult was about 5.2 tons. They also used data on how quickly Tyrannosaurus rex grew over their life span they had a growth spurt around sexual maturity and could grow to weigh about 7 tons. From these estimates, they calculated that each generation lasted about 19 years, and that the average population density was about one dinosaur for every 100 km2. Then, estimating that the total geographic range of Tyrannosaurus rex was about 2.3 million km2, and that the species survived for roughly 2.5 million years, they calculated a standing population size of 20,000. Over a total of about 127,000 generations that the species lived, that translates to about 2.5 billion individuals overall. Whats more, the scientists estimate that the population density of the species equated to 3,800 Tyrannosaurus rex in an area the size of California. The results also allowed them to determine that only about 1 in 80 million Tyrannosaurus rex survived the eons as fossilized remains. There are about 32 relatively well preserved, post juvenile Tyrannosaurus rexes in public museums today, Professor Marshall said. Of all the post juvenile adults that ever lived, this means we have about one in 80 million of them. If we restrict our analysis of the fossil recovery rate to where Tyrannosaurus rex fossils are most common, a portion of the famous Hell Creek Formation in Montana, we estimate we have recovered about one in 16,000 of the Tyrannosaurus rexes that lived in that region over that time interval that the rocks were deposited. We were surprised by this number this fossil record has a much higher representation of the living than I first guessed. It could be as good as one in a 1,000, if hardly any lived there, or it could be as low as one in a quarter million, given the uncertainties in the estimated population densities of the beast. The teams results were published today in the journal Science. "}, {"title": " World\u2019s Smallest Stegosaur Footprint Found", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 16, 2021", "doc": "An international team of paleontologists has discovered a 5.7 cm long stegosaur footprint in Xinjiang province, China. The newly discovered stegosaur footprint was left around 110 million years ago Early Cretaceous epoch. It belongs to the ichnogenus Deltapodus and co occurs with the tracks of larger individuals. Found in the Tugulu Group, Chinas Xinjiang province, it is only 15 as long as the type of Deltapodus curriei from the same locality. This footprint was made by an herbivorous, armored dinosaur known broadly as a stegosaur  the family of dinosaurs that includes the famed Stegosaurus, said Dr. Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Queensland. Like Stegosaurus, this little dinosaur probably had spikes on its tail and bony plates along its back as an adult. With a footprint of less than 6 cm, this is the smallest stegosaur footprint known in the world. Its in strong contrast with other stegosaur prints found at the Chinese track site which measured up to 30 cm, and prints found in places like Broome in Western Australia where they can be up to 80 cm. The tiny stegosaur footprint has similar characteristics of other stegosaur footprints with three short, wide, round toe impressions. However, Dr. Romilio and colleagues found the print wasnt elongated like larger counterpart prints discovered at the track sites, which suggests the young stegosaur had a different behavior. Stegosaurs typically walked with their heels on the ground, much like humans do, but on all fours which creates long footprints, Dr. Romilio said. The tiny track shows that this dinosaur had been moving with its heel lifted off the ground, much like a bird or cat does today. Weve only previously seen shortened tracks like this when dinosaurs walked on two legs. It was plausible young stegosaurs were toe walkers, said Dr. Lida Xing, a paleontologist in the State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology and the School of the Earth Sciences and Resources at the China University of Geosciences. This could be possible as this is the ancestral condition and a posture of most dinosaurs, but the stegosaur could also have transitioned to heel walking as it got older. A complete set of tracks of these tiny footprints would provide us with the answer to this question, but unfortunately we only have a single footprint. The study was published online in the journal Palaios. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Unlock Secret of Azhdarchid Pterosaurs\u2019 Extremely Long Necks", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 15, 2021", "doc": "Paleontologists have found that the thin neck vertebrae of the azhdarchid pterosaurs got their strength from an intricate internal structure. Pterosaurs  flying reptiles of the Mesozoic era  made their first appearance in the fossil record in the Late Triassic and survived until the end of the Cretaceous approximately 66 million years ago. Although some pterosaurs were small, with wingspans of less than 1 m, members of the enigmatic pterosaur family Azhdarchidae achieved wingspans of up to 10 m, possibly even as high as 12 m. The azhdarchids are notable for elongation of the neck as a result of hyper elongation of their cervical vertebrae. These animals had ridiculously long necks, said Cariad Williams, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. In some species, the fifth vertebra of the neck from the head end is as long as the animals body. It makes a giraffe look perfectly normal. We wanted to know a bit about how this incredibly long neck functioned, as it seems to have very little mobility between each vertebra. Williams and colleagues investigated the internal micro architecture of a well preserved cervical vertebra from the Cretaceous azhdarchid pterosaur Alanqa sp. found in the Kem Kem Group of Morocco. One of our most important findings is the arrangement of cross struts within the vertebral centrum, said Dr. Dave Martill, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth. It is unlike anything seen previously in a vertebra of any animal. The neural tube is placed centrally within the vertebra and is connected to the external wall via a number of thin rod like trabeculae, radially arranged like the spokes of a bicycle wheel and helically arranged along the length of the vertebra. They even cross over like the spokes of a bicycle wheel. Evolution shaped these creatures into awesome, breathtakingly efficient flyers. The teams analysis suggests that as few as 50 of the spoke like trabeculae increased the amount of weight azhdarchid necks could carry without buckling by 90. Together with the basic tube within a tube structure, it explains how the relatively light weight animals could capture and carry heavy prey items without breaking their necks. It appears that this structure of extremely thin cervical vertebrae and added helically arranged cross struts resolved many concerns about the biomechanics of how these creatures were able to support massive heads  longer than 1.5 m  on necks longer than that of the modern day giraffe, all whilst retaining the ability of powered flight, Dr. Martill said. While pterosaurs are sometimes thought of as evolutionary dead ends, the new findings reveal them as fantastically complex and sophisticated. Their bones and skeletons were marvels of biology  extremely light yet strong and durable, the paleontologists said. Theres still much to learn in future work about pterosaurs, including seemingly basic questions about their flight abilities and feeding ecology. The findings appear in the journal iScience. "}, {"title": " 98-Million-Year-Old Pollen-Feeding Beetle Found Preserved in Amber", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 14, 2021", "doc": "Paleontologists have found an exceptionally preserved short winged flower beetle and associated pollen aggregations and coprolites in a piece of mid Cretaceous amber originating from northern Myanmar. The discovery provides the direct evidence of pollen feeding in a Cretaceous beetle and confirms that diverse beetle lineages visited early angiosperms flowering plants in the Cretaceous period. Beetles are often cited as likely candidates for the earliest pollinators of angiosperms due to their long evolutionary history. Ii has been suggested that early associations between beetles and angiosperms in the Cretaceous played a key role in the diversification of both groups. Until now, pollination in beetles has been determined only on the basis of amber inclusions being preserved alongside pollen grains, possessing morphological features interpreted as possibly facilitating pollination, and having living relatives that are known to feed on pollen. The newly identified pollen feeding beetle, named Pelretes vivificus, lived 98.2 million year ago in what is now Myanmar. Its closest relatives are short winged flower beetles family Kateretidae that today occur in Australia, visiting a diverse range of flowers and feeding on their pollen. Pelretes vivificus is associated with clusters of pollen grains, suggesting that short winged flower beetles visited angiosperms in the Cretaceous, said Professor Chenyang Cai, a paleontologist at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. Some aspects of the beetles anatomy, such as its hairy abdomen, are also adaptations associated with pollination. The piece of amber examined by the team came from a mine in the Hukawng Valley, Kachin State, northern Myanmar. Besides the unparalleled abundance of fossil insects, the amber dates back to the mid Cretaceous, right when angiosperms were taking off, said Dr. Erik Tihelka, an entomologist and paleontologist at the University of Bristol. While Pelretes vivificus is not the first pollinating beetle to be described from Cretaceous amber, this unique specimen preserves a bizarre clue about its diet. The fossil is associated with beetle coprolites that provide a very unusual but important insight into the diet of short winged flower beetles in the Cretaceous. The coprolites are completely composed of pollen, the same type that is found in clusters surrounding the beetle and attached to its body, which suggest that Pelretes vivificus visited angiosperms to feed on their pollen. This finding provides a direct link between early flowering plants in the Cretaceous and their insect visitors. It shows that these insect fossils were not just incidentally co preserved with pollen, but that there was a genuine biological association between the two. The pollen associated with the beetle can be assigned to the fossil genus Tricolpopollenites, said Dr. Liqin Li, a fossil pollen specialist at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. This group is attributed to the eudicots, a living group of derived angiosperms, that includes the orders Malpighiales and Ericales. This shows that pollinators took advantage of early angiosperms soon after their initial diversification and visited a diverse range of groups by the mid Cretaceous, Professor Cai added.

Kunpengopterus antipollicatus is thought to have lived between 161 and 158 million years ago Jurassic period. The flying reptile had a small body, a primitive, elongate tail, and an estimated wingspan of 85 cm 33.5 inches. It was a type of a darwinopteran, a primitive subgroup of predatory pterosaurs with transitional anatomy. Darwinopterans are a group of pterosaurs from the Jurassic of China and Europe, named after Charles Darwin due to their unique transitional anatomy that has revealed how evolution affected the anatomy of pterosaurs throughout time, explained Dr. Rodrigo V. P\u00eagas, a paleontologist at the Federal University of ABC. Nicknamed Monkeydactyl, Kunpengopterus antipollicatus is the first known pterosaur with an opposed pollex thumb. This species also represents the earliest record of a true opposed thumb in Earths history. The fingers of Monkeydactyl are tiny and partly embedded in the slab, said Dr. Fion Waisum Ma, a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Birmingham. Thanks to micro CT scanning, we could see through the rocks, create digital models and tell how the opposed thumb articulates with the other finger bones. This is an interesting discovery. It provides the earliest evidence of a true opposed thumb, and it is from a pterosaur  which wasnt known for having an opposed thumb. By studying its forelimb morphology and musculature, the paleontologists suggest that Kunpengopterus antipollicatus could have used its hand for grasping, which is likely an adaptation for arboreal life. A true opposed pollex is mostly present in mammals e.g. primates and some tree frogs, but extremely rare among extant reptiles except for chameleons, the researchers said. This discovery adds to the list that darwinopteran pterosaurs such as Kunpengopterus antipollicatus also evolved an opposed thumb. The two fossilized specimens of Kunpengopterus antipollicatus  one of which with two associated eggs  were recovered form the Tiaojishan Formation of Liaoning in China. Tiaojishan paleoforest is home to many organisms, including three genera of darwinopteran pterosaurs, said Dr. Xuanyu Zhou, a paleontologist at China University of Geosciences. Our results show that Kunpengopterus antipollicatus has occupied a different niche from Darwinopterus and Wukongopterus, which has likely minimized competition among these pterosaurs. On top of that, a particular darwinopteran fossil has been preserved with two associated eggs, revealing clues to pterosaur reproduction, Dr. P\u00eagas said. Theyve always been considered precious fossils for these reasons and it is impressive that new darwinopteran species continue to surprise us The study was published in the journal Current Biology.

Life restoration of Ornatops incantatus. Illustration by Brian Engh  httpdontmesswithdinosaurs.com, commissioned by Western Science Center. Dubbed Ornatops incantatus, the new dinosaur roamed Earth around 80 million years ago Late Cretaceous epoch. Its partial skeleton, including part of the skull, was found at a single locality in the Menefee Formation in San Juan County, New Mexico. The Menefee Formation represents one of the most promising frontiers for exploring the early evolution of major dinosaur groups in Laramidia, the Upper Cretaceous landmass consisting of Mexico, the western United States, western Canada, and Alaska, Dr. Andrew McDonald from the Western Science Center and colleagues wrote in their paper. Dating to approximately 84 78 million years ago, the Menefee Formation predates the most productive Upper Cretaceous dinosaur bearing units in western North America, such as the Kirtland Formation of New Mexico, the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, and the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta. Ornatops incantatus is a member of Brachylophosaurini, a group of hadrosaurid dinosaurs that inhabited western North America during the Campanian age 84 72 million years ago of the Cretaceous period. Features of the skull roof and braincase identify the new hadrosaurid as a member of Brachylophosaurini, one of several subclades within Saurolophinae, the solid crested hadrosaurids, the paleontologists explained. The new species is closely related to  and possibly intermediate between  two other brachylophosaurin species Probrachylophosaurus bergei and Brachylophosaurus canadensis. Ornatops incantatus is the first brachylophosaurin hadrosaur from New Mexico and the southernmost occurrence of the group, the researchers wrote. It is also the first crested brachylophosaurin discovered in the southern part of Laramidia. The teams paper was published online April 2, 2021 in the journal PeerJ.

A research team led by Dr. Danielle Fraser from the Canadian Museum of Nature, Carleton University, and Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, investigated if and how diets of Yukon gray wolves changed from the Pleistocene 50,000 to 26,000 years ago to the recent times. We can study the change in diet by examining wear patterns on the teeth and chemical traces in the wolf bones, said Zoe Landry, a student at Carleton University. These can tell us a lot about how the animal ate, and what the animal was eating throughout its life, up until about a few weeks before it died. Dr. Fraser, Landry and their colleagues relied on established models that can determine an animals eating behavior by examining microscopic wear patterns on its teeth. Scratch marks indicate the wolf would have been consuming flesh, while the presence of pits would suggest chewing and gnawing on bones, likely as a scavenger. The analysis showed that scratch marks prevailed in both the ancient and modern wolf teeth, meaning that the wolves continued to survive as primary predators, hunting their prey. Their modern diet is well established the diet of the ancient wolves was assessed by looking at the ratios of carbon and nitrogen isotopes extracted from collagen in the bones. Relative levels of the isotopes can be compared with established indicators for specific species. The results showed that horses, which went extinct during the Pleistocene, accounted for about half of the gray wolf diet. About 15 came from caribou and Dalls sheep, with some mammoth mixed in. At this time, the ancient wolves would have co existed with other large predators such as scimitar cats and short faced bears. The eventual extinction of these predators could have created more opportunity for the wolves to transition to new prey species. This is really a story of Ice Age survival and adaptation, and the building up of a species towards the modern form in terms of ecological adaptation, said Dr. Grant Zazula, a paleontologist with the Palaeontology Program of Government of Yukon.

Jueconodon cheni is a eutriconodontan, a distant cousin of modern placental mammals and marsupials, and was 17.8 cm 7 inches long. Fossiomanus sinensis is an herbivorous mammal like animal called a tritylodontid, and was 31.6 cm 12.2 inches in length. It is the first of its kind to be identified in the Jehol Biota. The Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota has generated many well preserved fossils that have furnished a great deal of information on the morphology and evolution of early mammals, said Dr. Jin Meng from the American Museum of Natural History and colleagues. The two new species expand the diversity of the mammaliamorph assemblage and increase its morphological disparity, as they show unequivocal evidence of convergent adaptation for a fossorial lifestyle. The two specimens also provide an opportunity to learn more about the biology such as axial skeletal development of these extinct forms. Mammals that are adapted to burrowing have specialized traits for digging. Dr. Meng and co authors found some of these hallmark features  such as shorter limbs, strong forelimbs with robust hands, and a short tail  in both Fossiomanus sinensis and Jueconodon cheni. In particular, these characteristics point to a type of digging behavior known as scratch digging, accomplished mainly by the claws of the forelimbs. There are many hypotheses about why animals dig into the soil and live underground, Dr. Meng said. For protection against predators, to maintain a temperature thats relatively constant or to find food sources like insects and plant roots. These two fossils are a very unusual, deep time example of animals that are not closely related and yet both evolved the highly specialized characteristics of a digger. Fossiomanus sinensis and Jueconodon cheni also share another unusual feature an elongated vertebral column. Typically, mammals have 26 vertebrae from the neck to the hip. However, Fossiomanus sinensis had 38 vertebrae, while Jueconodon cheni had 28. To try to determine how these animals got their elongated trunks, the paleontologists turned to recent studies in developmental biology. They found that the variation could be attributed to gene mutations that determine the number and shape of the vertebrae in the beginning of the animals embryotic development. These fossils shed light on the evolutionary development of the axial skeleton in mammaliamorphs, which has been the focus of numerous studies in vertebrate evolution and developmental biology, they said. The discovery of Fossiomanus sinensis and Jueconodon cheni is reported in the journal Nature.

Trilobites are extinct marine arthropods that dominated the ecosystems of the Paleozoic era. They appeared in ancient oceans in the Early Cambrian period, about 540 million years ago, well before life emerged on land, and disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the Permian period, about 252 million years ago. They were extremely diverse, with about 20,000 species, and their fossil exoskeletons can be found all around the world. Up until now, scientists have compared the upper branch of the trilobite leg to the non respiratory upper branch in crustaceans, but our paper shows, for the first time, that the upper branch functioned as a gill, said lead author Dr. Jin Bo Hou, a doctoral student in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of California, Riverside. Dr. Hou and colleagues examined the pyritized remains of two trilobite species Olenoides serratus from the Burgess Shale and Triarthrus eatoni from the Beechers Beds. Triarthrus eatoni lived approximately 450 million years ago Ordovician period Olenoides serratus lived during the Cambrian period, about 500 million years ago. These were preserved in pyrite  fools gold  but its more important than gold to us, because its key to understanding these ancient structures, said co author Professor Nigel Hughes, a paleontologist in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at the University of California, Riverside, and the Geological Studies Unit at the Indian Statistical Institute. Using a CT scanner, the researchers created 3D models of dumbbell shaped filaments in the upper limb branches of both Olenoides serratus and Triarthrus eatoni. It allowed us to see the fossil without having to do a lot of drilling and grinding away at the rock covering the specimen, said Dr. Melanie Hopkins, a paleontologist in the Division of Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. This way we could get a view that would even be hard to see under a microscope  really small trilobite anatomical structures on the order of 10 to 30 microns wide. The researchers could see how blood would have filtered through chambers in these delicate structures, picking up oxygen along its way as it moved. They appear much the same as gills in modern marine arthropods like crabs and lobsters. In the past, there was some debate about the purpose of these structures because the upper leg isnt a great location for breathing apparatus, Dr. Hopkins said. Youd think it would be easy for those filaments to get clogged with sediment where they are. Its an open question why they evolved the structure in that place on their bodies. The findings appear in the journal Science Advances.

The impact unleashed an incredible amount of climate changing gases into the atmosphere, triggering a chain of events that led to the extinction of non avian dinosaurs and 75 of life on the planet. In an analysis of thousands of fossil pollen and leaves from before and after the Chicxulub impact, scientists from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and elsewhere found that the cataclysmic impact also caused 45 of plants in what is now Colombia to go extinct, setting the stage for the evolution of the Neotropical rainforests. In the study, Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute paleontologist Dr. Carlos Jaramillo and colleagues examined fossil pollen over 50,000 occurrences and leaves over 6,000 specimens from before and after the Chicxulub impact from 39 localities in Colombia. We wondered how tropical rainforests changed after a drastic ecological perturbation such as the Chicxulub impact, so we looked for tropical plant fossils, explained first author Dr. M\u00f3nica Carvalho, a postdoctoral researcher at Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the Universidad del Rosario. Pollen and spores obtained from rocks older than the impact show that rainforests were equally dominated by ferns and flowering plants. Conifers were common and cast their shadows over dinosaur trails. After the impact, conifers disappeared almost completely from the New World tropics, and flowering plants took over. Plant diversity did not recover for over 6 million years after the impact. The researchers found evidence that pre impact tropical forest trees were spaced far apart, allowing light to reach the forest floor. Within 6 million years post impact, some tropical forests were dense, like those of today, where leaves of trees and vines cast deep shade on the smaller trees, bushes and herbaceous plants below. The sparser canopies of the pre impact forests, with fewer flowering plants, would have moved less soil water into the atmosphere than did those that grew up in the millions of years afterward. It was just as rainy back in the Cretaceous, but the forests worked differently, Dr. Carvalho said. The team found no evidence of legume trees before the extinction event, but afterward there was a great diversity and abundance of legume leaves and pods. Today, legumes are a dominant family in tropical rainforests, and through associations with bacteria, take nitrogen from the air and turn it into fertilizer for the soil. The rise of legumes would have dramatically affected the nitrogen cycle. How did the after effects of the impact transform sparse, conifer rich tropical forests of the dinosaur age into the rainforests of today  towering trees dotted with yellow, purple and pink blossoms, dripping with orchids? Based on evidence from both pollen and leaves, Dr. Jaramillo, Dr. Carvalho and their colleagues propose three explanations for the change, all of which may be correct. One idea is that dinosaurs kept pre impact forests open by feeding and moving through the landscape. A second explanation is that falling ash from the impact enriched soils throughout the tropics, giving an advantage to the faster growing flowering plants. The third explanation is that preferential extinction of conifer species created an opportunity for flowering plants to take over the tropics. Our study follows a simple question How do tropical rainforests evolve?, Dr. Carvalho said. The lesson learned here is that under rapid disturbances  geologically speaking  tropical ecosystems do not just bounce back they are replaced, and the process takes a really long time. A paper on the findings was published in the journal Science.

Llukalkan aliocranianus roamed our planet during the Late Cretaceous epoch, about 80 million years ago. The dinosaur was a member of Abelisauridae, a family of big predators known from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. It grew to about 5 m\u00a016.4 feet in length, and had extremely powerful bite, very sharp teeth, huge claws, and keen sense of smell. It also had a strange short skull with rough bones, so in life its head had bulges and prominences like some living reptiles. But the most distinctive feature of Llukalkan aliocranianus is a small posterior air filled sinus in the middle ear zone that has not been seen in any other abelisaurid found so far, said Dr. Ariel Mendez, a paleontologist at the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. It means that this dinosaur likely heard differently to other abelisaurids  most probably better and similar to that of a modern day crocodile. This finding implies a different hearing adaptation from other abelisaurids, and likely a keener sense of hearing. The fossilized cranial remains of Llukalkan aliocranianus were recovered from the Bajo de la Carpa Formation at La Invernada fossil area in northwestern Patagonia, Argentina. According to the team, the ancient predator lived in the same small area and period of time as Viavenator exxoni, another species of furileusaurian abelisaurid from the Bajo de la Carpa Formation. This is a particularly important discovery because it suggests that the diversity and abundance of abelisaurids were remarkable, not only across Patagonia, but also in more local areas during the dinosaurs twilight period, said Dr. Federico Gianechini, a paleontologist at the National University of San Luis. Llukalkan aliocranianus was similar in many respects to Viavenator exxoni, except that it was smaller, the holes in the skull through which the veins pass were larger and more widely separated from the supraoccipital crest, among other differences. This discovery also suggests that there are likely more abelisaurid out there that we just havent found yet, so we will be looking for other new species and a better understanding of the relationship among furilesaurs, Dr. Gianechini said. The discovery of Llukalkan aliocranianus is reported in a paper published this week in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

Dromornithids are an extinct group of large flightless birds that lived in Australia from the Eocene to the Late Pleistocene epoch. Four genera and eight species are currently recognized, with diversity highest in the Miocene epoch. Collectively known as mihirungs an Aboriginal word for a giant bird, these birds not only reached much larger sizes than ratites emus, cassowaries, ostriches, kiwis and kin, but were much more intimidating in appearance. Unlike the small headed ratites, they had massive skulls, with sail like bills. Even the smallest of these birds was as large as an emu, while others grew to the size of a horse, with males weighing up to 650 kg. Despite their size, all were gentle giants, browsing on fruit and leaves of shrubs. Together with their large, forward facing eyes and very large bills, the shape of their brains and nerves suggested these birds likely had well developed stereoscopic vision, or depth perception, and fed on a diet of soft leaves and fruit, said Dr. Warren Handley, a vertebrate paleontologist in the Palaeontology Group at Flinders University. The shape of their brains and nerves has told us a lot about their sensory capabilities, and something about their possible lifestyle which enabled these remarkable birds to live in the forests around river channels and lakes across Australia for an extremely long time. Its exciting when we can apply modern imaging methods to reveal features of dromornithid morphology that were previously completely unknown. In the study, Dr. Handley and his colleagues, Dr. Trevor Worthy from the Palaeontology Group at Flinders University, compared the brain structures of four mihirung species from the earliest Dromornis murrayi that lived 24 million years ago to Dromornis planei and Ilbandornis woodburnei from 12 million years ago and Dromornis stirtoni from 7 million years ago. Ranging from cassowary in size to whats known as the worlds largest bird, the largest and last species Dromornis stirtoni was an extreme evolutionary experiment, Dr. Worthy said. The researchers found that mihirung brains and nerves were most like those of modern day chickens and Australian mallee fowl. The unlikely truth is these birds were related to fowl  chickens and ducks  but their closest cousin and much of their biology still remains a mystery, Dr. Worthy said. While the brains of dromornithids were very different to any bird living today, it also appears they shared a similar reliance on good vision for survival with living ratities such as ostrich and emu. Dromornis stirtoni had the largest skull but behind the massive bill was a weird cranium, he added. To accommodate the muscles to wield this massive bill, the cranium had become taller and wider than it was long, and so the brain within was squeezed and flattened to fit. It would appear these giant birds were probably what evolution produced when it gave chickens free reign in Australian environmental conditions and so they became very different to their relatives the megapodes  or chicken like landfowls which still exist in the Australasian region. The results were published in the March 2021 issue of the journal Diversity. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Uncover Remains of Extinct Tree-Climbing Kangaroo", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Mar 25, 2021", "doc": "Congruus kitcheneri, an extinct species of\u00a0kangaroo that lived in Australia between 2.6 million and 12,000 years ago, was adapted for climbing trees, although it was larger and not as specialized for arboreal living as the tree kangaroos. Kangaroos and their relatives family Macropodidae descended from arboreal possum like ancestors during the Paleogene period before becoming the main ground dwelling mammalian herbivores of the Australian continent over the past 20 million years, said Flinders Universitys Professor Gavin Prideaux and Dr. Natalie Warburton of Murdoch University. There are more than 60 living species, including bettongs, wallabies and kangaroos, and many more extinct species, including giant short faced kangaroos. Smaller extant macropodids are mainly solitary fungivores or browsers, while larger species tend to be grass consumers. Eleven of the 12 living macropodine genera are characterized by species that are principally ground dwelling. They employ a bipedal hopping when moving at speed, and a pentapedal mode, involving the use of the tail as a fifth limb when moving slowly. These locomotory styles are facilitated by striking adaptations in physiology and skeletal anatomy, including elongation of the hindlimbs and feet, and reconfiguration of the ankle joint to minimize lateral and rotational movement during hopping. The one living genus that deviates from this pattern is Dendrolagus, which contains the tree kangaroos of New Guinea and extreme northeastern Australia. They descended from ground dwelling ancestors by ascending into the trees. Tree kangaroos can hop bipedally as well as move their hindlimbs alternately. In a paper published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, the researchers presented the first published skeletal description of an extinct Australian macropodine that is not a tree kangaroo. The specimens we analyzed suggest this species would climb and move slowly through trees, Dr. Warburton said. The team examined several cranial specimens and two near complete\u00a0kangaroo skeletons, a male and a female, from the Thylacoleo Caves of the Nullarbor Plain in south central Australia. The Thylacoleo Caves are famous for both the remarkably complete preservation of the fossil remains and the insights they provide into the unexpectedly high level of diversity of large marsupial species that inhabited what is now an arid treeless plain, Professor Prideaux said. Despite purportedly being an expert in fossil kangaroos, it took me most of that time to work out that these two skeletons belonged to a species first described decades earlier from jaw fragments from a cave in southwestern Australia. By undertaking a painstaking process of identifying and describing the anatomical details of every single bone that was recovered from the skeletons, we have been able to reveal that this species of extinct\u00a0kangaroo was adapted for climbing trees in order to browse on plant material not available to animals that are stuck on the ground, Dr. Warburton said. This extinct species was first described as Wallabia kitcheneri in 1989 from Pleistocene deposits of Mammoth Cave in southwestern Australia. Professor Prideaux and Dr. Warburton reallocated it to the previously monotypic genus Congruus. These fossils have unusually long fingers and toes with long, curved claws, in comparison to other kangaroos and wallabies, for gripping powerful arm muscles to raise and hold themselves up in trees, and a longer, more mobile neck than other kangaroos that would be useful for reaching out the head in different directions for browsing on leaves, Dr. Warburton said. This is really interesting, not just from the point of view of unexpected tree climbing behavior in a large kangaroo, but also as these specimens come from an area that is now bare of trees, and so tells us that the habitat and environment in the area were really different to what they are now, and perhaps different to what we might have previously interpreted for that time. This is unexpected and exciting and it provides us with new information as we try to understand the changing environments of Australia through time.

The newly identified shark species, named Aquilolamna milarcae, swam in the Late Cretaceous oceans, approximately 93 million years ago. The complete specimen was found in 2012 in Vallecillo, Mexico, a locality yielding remarkably preserved fossils, said lead author Dr. Romain Vullo from the University of Rennes and the CNRS and colleagues. This site, already famous for its many fossils of ammonites, bony fish and other marine reptiles, is most useful for documenting the evolution of oceanic animals. Aquilolamna milarcae belongs to Lamniformes, an order of sharks in the subclass Elasmobranchii. Elasmobranchs are the highly successful group of cartilaginous fishes, including sharks, skates and rays, the paleontologists said. They first appeared in Earths oceans roughly 380 million years ago and have since evolved to fill a diverse array of ecological roles. Modern plankton feeding elasmobranchs are characterized by two distantly related clades  those with a more traditional shark like body shape, such as whale and basking sharks, and those with the sleek, flattened bodies and winglike fins of Mobulidae rays. Standing out among both living and fossil planktivorous plankton eating sharks and rays, Aquilolamna milarcae resides somewhere in between. Aquilolamna milarcae had many features similar to modern manta rays, notably long, slender fins and a mouth adapted to filter feeding, suggesting that it was planktivorous. It had a caudal fin with a well developed superior lobe, typical of most pelagic sharks, such as whale sharks and tiger sharks, Dr. Vullo said. Thus, its anatomical features thus give it a chimeric appearance that combines both sharks and rays. With its large mouth and supposed very small teeth, it must have fed on plankton.  Aquilolamna milarcae was a relatively slow swimmer, using both its long pectoral fins and tail to glide through the water while scooping up suspended plankton using its large, gaping mouth. Its body plan represents an unexpected evolutionary experimentation with underwater flight among sharks, more than 30 million years before the rise of Mobulidae rays, and shows that winglike pectoral fins have evolved independently in two distantly related clades of filter feeding elasmobranches, the researchers said. The discovery of Aquilolamna milarcae is reported in a paper in the journal Science.

Bees, bumblebees, and butterflies are widely known pollinators of flowering plants who, to some degree, also feed on pollen, said Dr. Sonja Wedmann, a researcher at the Senckenberg Research Institute and the Natural History Museum in Frankfurt. Yet, it is often ignored that flies also play an important role in this regard. Our latest research results show that dipterans fed on pollen as long as approximately 50 million years ago Dr. Wedmann and her colleagues analyzed the contents of the conspicuously swollen abdomen of Hirmoneura messelense, which was discovered at the famous Messel Pit paleontological site near Darmstadt in Germany. They found pollen grains from at least four plant families Lythraceae, Vitaceae, Sapotaceae, and Oleaceae mainly from two extant plant genera Decodon water willows and Parthenocissus Virginia creepers. This is the first indication that flies from the family Nemestrinidae fed on pollen in the past  and possibly continue to do so until today, Dr. Wedmann said. Such fossil food remnants are extremely rare on a global scale, she added. They allow inferences as to the animals lifestyle and feeding behavior as well as the environmental conditions under which the animals lived at the time. The large volume of Parthenocissus pollen supports the hypothesis that Hirmoneura messelense fed on plants that grew along the edge of an ancient forest and the Messel lake. The flies undoubtedly avoided long distance flights between their food plants to save energy, Dr. Wedmann said. We therefore assume that the plants associated with the pollen could be found within a relatively small area. We assume that the flies played an important role in transporting the pollen, and thus in the propagation of several plant families, she concluded. It is possible that flies were  and still are  more important than bees for the pollination of tropical plants. The findings were published in the journal Current Biology.

Ice sheets typically pulverize and destroy everything in their path, but what we discovered was delicate plant structures  perfectly preserved, said Dr. Andrew Christ, a researcher in the Department of Geology and the Gund Institute for Environment at the University of Vermont. Theyre fossils, but they look like they died yesterday. Its a time capsule of what used to live on Greenland that we wouldnt be able to find anywhere else. Dr. Christ and colleagues analyzed sediment at the bottom of the Camp Century ice core, collected 120 km\u00a075 miles from the coast in northwestern Greenland. The subglacial sediment from the Camp Century ice core was collected in 1966, they explained. The sediment was stored frozen, initially at University at Buffalo from 1966, until it was transferred to Niels Bohr Institute in 1994 and 1996. The sediment, frozen under nearly 1.4 km\u00a00.9. miles of ice, contained well preserved fossil plants and biomolecules sourced from at least two ice free warm periods in the past few million years. We used a series of advanced analytical techniques  none of which were available to researchers fifty years ago  to probe the sediment, fossils, and the waxy coating of leaves found at the bottom of the Camp Century ice core, the scientists said. For example, we measured ratios of rare isotopes of both aluminum and the element beryllium that form in quartz only when the ground is exposed to the sky and can be hit by cosmic rays. Another test used rare forms of oxygen, found in the ice within the sediment, to reveal that precipitation must have fallen at much lower elevations than the height of the current ice sheet, demonstrating ice sheet absence. The authors concluded that the Greenland Ice Sheet persisted through much of the Pleistocene but melted and reformed at least once since 1.1 million years ago. Our study shows that Greenland is much more sensitive to natural climate warming than we used to think  and we already know that humanitys out of control warming of the planet hugely exceeds the natural rate, Dr. Christ said.

Paleontologists know that the three ossicles  the malleus, incus and stapes  in extant mammals close non mammal relatives were attached to the lower jaw and functioned with it, serving in both chewing and hearing. In many mammal lineages, these bones eventually detached from the lower jaw and came to serve only auditory functions. The details of this transition have been mysterious. In the new research, Professor Shundong Bi from Yunnan University and the Indiana University of Pennsylvania and colleagues analyzed computed tomographic CT images of the well preserved malleus and incus of Vilevolodon diplomylos. They found the ancient animals malleus and incus remarkably similar to those of modern monotremes. Since haramiyidans and monotremes are not thought to be closely related, this resemblance demonstrates a surprising instance of convergent evolution. Although separated by 160 million years of geologic time, it is remarkable how similar these bones are in Vilevolodon diplomylos and the living monotremes, the platypus and echidna, said Dr. John Wible, a researcher at Yunnan University and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The preservation of these ossicles in the fossil is amazing the incus is just a little over a millimeter across The malleus and incus of monotremes have long been considered to be unique adaptations as they are wholly unlike these bones in the remaining living mammals, marsupials and placentals. This type of malleus and incus represent an evolutionary stage between fossils with ossicles attached to and functioning with the lower jaw and those where the ossicles are detached from the lower jaw and exclusively function for hearing, the researchers said. We hope the discovery advances the understanding of how mammals, including humans, developed their unique sense of hearing. The results were published in the journal Nature.

The newly discovered plesiosaur lived approximately 67 million years ago during the Maastrichtian stage of the Cretaceous period. Dubbed Wunyelfia maulensis, the animal belongs to Aristonectinae, a group of plesiosaurs in the family Elasmosauridae. It is only the second representative of this group known to date in the southeastern Pacific during the late Maastrichtian stage. The Aristonectinae was a monophyletic lineage of elasmosaurid plesiosaurs morphologically and ecologically distinct from other typically long necked elasmosaurids, said University of Chile paleontologists Dr. Rodrigo Otero and Dr. Sergio Soto Acu\u00f1a. The first were characterized by the acquisition of enlarged skulls, an increased tooth number, as well as shortened and thickened necks, which spanned mostly along the Weddellian Province during the Late Cretaceous. They are frequent in the Maastrichtian of the southern hemisphere, with occurrences in Argentinean Patagonia, central and southern Chile, New Zealand and Antarctica. The growing body of evidence currently shows that among austral elasmosaurid plesiosaurs, at least one monophyletic lineage Aristonectinae reached a provincial diversity with endemic forms in Antarctica, New Zealand and southern South America during the Late Cretaceous. The near adult, partial postcranial skeleton of Wunyelfia maulensis was recovered from the upper Maastrichtian levels of the Quiriquina Formation in central Chile. The studied skeleton was recovered from strata exposed in the locality of Mariscadero, south of Pelluhue, 320 km 199 miles southwest from Santiago, the researchers explained. The specimen was found 20 cm 7.9 inches above a second partial postcranial skeleton of an indeterminate elasmosaurid. Its small almost adult size differs from coeval larger forms previously described in South America, particularly Aristonectes parvidens and Aristonectes quiriquinensis, with estimated lengths over 10 m 33 feet, they noted. Aristonectines seem to have exploited a unique trophic niche unrecorded among other plesiosaurs. The presence of Aristonectes and Wunyelfia during the late Maastrichtian of central Chile may correlate with a highly productive ecosystem able to support a taxonomic diversity within this distinctive ecomorphotype, the scientists said. Further studies on this new taxon and other early aristonectines will be key to understanding the origin and evolution of this singular clade of elasmosaurids. The discovery is reported in a paper in the February 2021 issue of the journal Cretaceous Research. "}, {"title": " Devonian Lamprey Hatchling-to-Adult Growth Series Sheds New Light on Vertebrate Origins", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 12, 2021", "doc": "Paleontologists from Canada, the United States and South Africa have unearthed the fossilized remains of larval and juvenile forms of four lamprey species that lived during the Paleozoic era, including a hatchling to adult growth series of the lamprey genus Priscomyzon from the Late Devonian of Gondwana. The discovery is overturning long held ideas as to what modern lampreys may tell us about the origin of vertebrates. Lampreys are an extremely primitive lineage of jawless fish. They are found in temperate regions around the world, except Africa, and live mostly in coastal and fresh waters, although some species travel significant distances in the open ocean. They feed by latching onto other fish with a sucker around their mouth, securing their grip with circles of teeth and then drinking their victims blood after rasping a hole with special teeth on their tongue. Until now, it was commonly believed that modern lampreys were swimming time capsules that could give unique insights into the biology and genome of a truly ancient lineage. This belief was supported by the discovery of Priscomyzon riniensis, a lamprey species that lived 360 million years ago in what is now South Africa. The discovery was met with excitement worldwide as it was the oldest lamprey ever found, yet it appeared to have been essentially almost identical to modern adult lampreys. In many ways, modern lampreys indeed provide unique insights into their ancient ancestry. But new evidence shows that this is not the case when it comes to the juvenile larval stage. Lampreys and modern hagfish are the only jawless fish alive that branched off from the family tree of vertebrates before they got jaws, said Dr. Rob Gess, a paleontologist at the Albany Museum and the Department of Geology at Rhodes University. This makes them very interesting for researchers attempting to understand the earliest stages of vertebrate history. Called ammocoetes, the blind, filter feeding, worm like larvae of modern lampreys burrow in stream beds and filter water for minute food particles before slowly transforming into free swimming, eyed, actively feeding adults. Crucially, this strange life history was thought to echo transformations some 500 million years ago, which gave rise to all fish lineages, including the one that ultimately led to humans. Hence, the last invertebrate ancestor of vertebrates is often portrayed as ammocoete like, and the earliest vertebrate as being lamprey like. But for this to be a reasonable model, both ammocoetes and lampreys would need to hark back to the dawn of vertebrate history. Now, for the first time, the conventional wisdom that our long chain of ancestors included an ammocoete like form can be directly tested, and the evidence strongly contradicts such an assumption, Dr. Gess said. Lampreys are virtually never fossilized as they had no bones or spines and just minute teeth, but in the 360 million old Waterloo Farm black shales near Makhanda Grahamstown in South Africas Eastern Cape province, impressions of their soft bodies are preserved as silvery white films in the black shale. Details of their cartilaginous skeletons show through like X rays. This is incredibly special. Nowhere else in the world are such ancient lamprey remains found. Painstaking excavation of these shale samples has revealed the growth series of Priscomyzon illustrating its development from hatchling to adult, he said. Remarkably, the smallest preserved individual, barely 15 mm in length, still carried a yolk sac. This signals that they had only just hatched before entering the fossil record. Of crucial importance even the hatchlings were already sighted with large eyes and armed with a toothed sucker, much like the blood sucking adult phase of modern lampreys and completely unlike their modern ammocoete counterparts. This drastically different structure of ancient lamprey infants provides evidence that modern lamprey larvae are not evolutionary relics. Rather, the modern filter feeding phase is a more recent innovation that allowed lampreys to populate and thrive in rivers and lakes. Less complete and previously unpublished partial growth series of three types of slightly younger lampreys from North America support the finding. Distant human ancestry seemingly did not include a lamprey larva like stage, he concluded. Lampreys now appear to be a highly evolved side branch which shared a common ancestor with us probably a jawless fish enclosed in bony armor. The findings are published in the journal Nature.

Although their diversity and distribution are well known, their place on the plant family tree remained enigmatic because their anatomy was unknown. In new research, paleobiologists in China discovered and reconstructed a new species of noeggerathialean tree that existed 298 million years ago during the Permian period their analysis shows that Noeggerathiales are more closely related to seed plants than to other fern groups. Noeggerathiales were recognized as early as the 1930s, but scientists have treated them as a taxonomic football, endlessly kicked around without anyone identifying their place in the Story of Life, said Dr. Jason Hilton, a paleobiologist at the Institute of Forest Research at the University of Birmingham. The spectacular fossil plants found in China are becoming renowned as the plant equivalent of Pompeii. Thanks to this slice of life preserved in volcanic ash, we were able to reconstruct a new species of Noeggerathiales that finally settles the groups affinity and evolutionary importance. The fate of the Noeggerathiales is a stark reminder of what can happen when even very advanced life forms are faced with rapid environmental change. Dr. Hilton and colleagues uncovered the fossilized remains of a new noeggerathialean species  named Paratingia wuhaia  within a 66 cm thick volcanic ash fall horizon previously termed the Chinese vegetational Pompeii at Wuda open coalmine, Inner Mongolia, China. They found that Noeggerathiales are in fact advanced tree ferns that evolved complex cone like structures from modified leaves. Despite their sophistication, they fell victim to the profound environmental and climate changes of 251 million years ago that destroyed swamp ecosystems globally. Many specimens were identified in excavations in 2006 2007 when a few leaves were visible on the surface of the ash, said Professor Jun Wang, a paleobiologist at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. It looked they might be connected to each other and a stem below  we revealed the crown on site, but then extracted the specimens complete to take them back to the lab. It has taken many years to study these fully and the additional specimens we have found more recently. The complete trees are the most impressive fossil plants I have seen and because of our careful work they are also some of the most important to science.

"}, {"title": " Paleontologists Find Remains of Oviraptorid Dinosaur and Embryo-Bearing Egg Clutch", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 10, 2021", "doc": "Paleontologists in China have discovered what they say is the first non avialan dinosaur fossil known to preserve an adult skeleton atop an egg clutch that contains embryonic remains. Dinosaurs preserved on their nests are rare, and so are fossil embryos, said Dr. Shundong Bi, a paleontologist in the Centre for Vertebrate Evolutionary Biology at the Yunnan Universitys Institute of Palaeontology and the Department of Biology at the Indiana University of Pennsylvania. This is the first time a non avian dinosaur has been found, sitting on a nest of eggs that preserve embryos, in a single spectacular specimen. The 70 million year old fossil was recovered from the Upper Cretaceous Nanxiong Formation near the Ganzhou railway station of Ganzhou city, Jiangxi Province, China. The specimen is a partial skeleton of a medium sized oviraptorid theropod preserved atop an undisturbed clutch of at least 24 eggs, some of which are broken, exposing embryonic bones. The eggs are 21.5 cm in length and 8.5 cm in width across their equatorial regions. The outer surface of all eggs exhibits ornamentation made up of fine, densely packed ridges approximately 2 3 mm in width. Embryonic material is exposed in seven eggs, but ossified bones with identifiable morphologies are observed only in four eggs. The late stage of development of the embryos and the close proximity of the adult to the eggs strongly suggests that the latter died in the act of incubating its nest, like its modern bird cousins, rather than laying its eggs or simply guarding its nest crocodile style. This kind of discovery, in essence fossilized behavior, is the rarest of the rare in dinosaurs, said Dr. Matthew Lamanna, a researcher in the Section of Vertebrate Paleontology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Though a few adult oviraptorids have been found on nests of their eggs before, no embryos have ever been found inside those eggs. In the new specimen, the babies were almost ready to hatch, which tells us beyond a doubt that this oviraptorid had tended its nest for quite a long time. This dinosaur was a caring parent that ultimately gave its life while nurturing its young. The researchers also conducted oxygen isotope analyses that indicate that the eggs were incubated at high, bird like temperatures, adding further support to the hypothesis that the adult perished in the act of brooding its nest. Moreover, although all embryos were well developed, some appear to have been more mature than others. This suggests that oviraptorid eggs in the same clutch might have hatched at slightly different times. Known as asynchronous hatching, this characteristic appears to have evolved independently in oviraptorids and some modern birds. Another interesting aspect of the specimen is that the adult preserves a cluster of gastroliths stomach stones in its abdominal region. This is the first time that undoubted gastroliths have been found in an oviraptorid, and as such, these stones may provide new insights into the diets of these animals. Its extraordinary to think how much biological information is captured in just this single fossil, said Dr. Xing Xu, a researcher at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology and the Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Were going to be learning from this specimen for many years to come. The findings appear in the journal Science Bulletin. "}, {"title": " New Bird-Like Dinosaur Identified in Spain", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Mar 8, 2021", "doc": "A new genus and species of troodontid dinosaur that lived 66 million years ago at the very end of the Cretaceous period has been identified from an isolated bone found in Catalonia, Spain. Tamarro insperatus lived in what is known as the Ibero Armorican island during the latest Maastrichtian age of the Cretaceous period, about 200,000 years before the end Cretaceous mass extinction. During the latest Cretaceous 77 66 million years ago in the run up to the end Cretaceous mass extinction, Europe was a series of islands populated by diverse and distinctive communities of dinosaurs and other vertebrates, said Dr. Albert Sell\u00e9s, a paleontologist in the Institut Catal\u00e0 de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafon at the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona and the Museu de la Conca Dell\u00e0, and his colleagues. Many of these animals exhibited peculiar features that may have been generated by lack of space and resources in their insular habitats. Tamarro insperatus was a type of troodontid Troodontidae, a group of bird like theropod dinosaurs that includes kiwi size i.e. 0.8 kg for Mei long to rhea size species i.e. 47 kg for Troodon formosus. The presence of troodontids in Europe has been debated for a long time, mainly because its record was entirely based on isolated teeth, until now, the paleontologists said. The oldest troodontid evidence in Europe dates back to the Early Cenomanian age 100 94 million years ago and is based on the discovery of one isolated tooth in western France. The discovery of Tamarro insperatus in the latest Maastrichtian deposits from southern Pyrenees represents the first unequivocal bone evidence of this group of small sized non avian theropods in Europe, and confirms the occurrence of troodontids in the theropod faunal assemblage of that continent. The 66 million year old isolated bone of Tamarro insperatus was discovered in September 2003 by a team of paleontologists from the Museu de la Conca Dell\u00e0 at the site of Sant Rom\u00e0 dAbella in Catalonia, Spain. Its unique combination of anatomical characters allows its identification as a new species, the researchers said. Furthermore, its histology shows a growth pattern in which it grew fast in early ontogeny but reached subadult size quickly. According to the authors, Tamarro insperatus appeared within the faunal turnover on the Ibero Armorican island in the early Maastrichtian age, which helps define the origins and timings of the migratory waves that brought the newcomers to the European archipelago. We hypothesize that it could have migrated from Asia to reach the Ibero Armorican island no later than Cenomanian or during the Maastrichtian dispersal events, they said.

The remains of Pleistocene megafauna, including proboscideans elephant like animals, are well documented in northeastern North America, but well dated finds are rare in New England with only eight examples in the region and none from the state of Vermont. The Mount Holly mammoth discovered during railroad construction in the summer of 1848 is the most complete and best documented set of proboscidean remains from Vermont, but remained undated. One molar, two tusks, and an unknown number of bones were excavated from a hilltop bog near Mount Holly. It has long been thought that megafauna and humans in New England did not overlap in time and space and that it was probably ultimately environmental change that led to the extinction of these animals in the region but our research provides some of the first evidence that they may have actually co existed, said Dartmouth College researchers Dr. Nathaniel Kitchel and Dr. Jeremy DeSilva. The researchers goal was to obtain a radiocarbon date for the fragmentary rib bone of the Mount Holly mammoth. They took a 3D scan of the material prior to taking a small one gram sample from the broken end of the rib bone. They then sent the sample to the Center for Applied Isotope Studies at the University of Georgia for radiocarbon dating and a stable istotopic analysis. The Mount Holly mammoth was one of the last known occurring mammoths in the Northeast, Dr. DeSilva said. The radiocarbon date for the fossil of 12,800 years old overlaps with the accepted age of when humans may have initially settled in the region, which is thought to have occurred during the start of the Younger Dryas. The findings were published in the journal Boreas.

The newly discovered dinosaur roamed Earth approximately 92 million years ago, during the Turonian stage of the Late Cretaceous epoch. Dubbed Dzharatitanis kingi, it belongs to Rebbachisauridae, a large family of plant eating dinosaurs. A single isolated vertebra of the new dinosaur was recovered from the Bissekty Formation at Dzharakuduk in Navoi Viloyat, Uzbekistan. The specimen was found by paleontologists during the URBAC international expedition in 1997. This is the first rebbachisaurid reported from Asia and one of the youngest rebbachisaurids in the known fossil record, Dr. Alexander Averianov of St. Petersburg Zoological Institute and Dr. Hans Dieter Sues of Smithsonian Institution wrote in their paper. The Rebbachisauridae is the second sauropod group identified in the assemblage of non avian dinosaurs from the Bissekty Formation, in addition to a previously identified indeterminate titanosaurian. All previous records of rebbachisaurid dinosaurs came from a narrow band extending from southernmost South America through the northeastern South America and northwestern Africa to Europe. The discovery of Dzharatitanis kingi now considerably extends the known distribution of this group to the east. It is most likely that these dispersed to Central Asia from Europe but it is not clear when this could have occurred. The Rebbachisauridae possibly dispersed from Europe to Asia via a land bridge across the Turgai Strait sometime between the Barremian and Turonian, the paleontologists wrote. The discovery is reported in a paper published this month in the journal PLoS ONE.

Plesiadapiformes first appeared during the Paleocene epoch, between 65 and 55 million years ago, although many were extinct by the beginning of the Eocene epoch. These ancient primates were small bodied and ate specialized diets of insects and fruits that varied by species. They are crucial to understanding the evolutionary and ecological origins of primates, treeshrews, and colugos as well as the traits that separate those groups from other mammals. Five new isolated plesiadapiform teeth were recovered from the Harleys Point locality of the Fort Union Formation in northeastern Montana. The fossils are estimated to be 65.9 million years old, about 105,000 to 139,000 years after the end Cretaceous mass extinction event. Two three from the sample are from a previously known species of plesiadapiform called Purgatorius janisae. Three other specimens represent a new species named Purgatorius mckeeveri. Its mind blowing to think of our earliest archaic primate ancestors, said co lead author Professor Wilson Mantilla, a vertebrate paleontologist in the Department of Biology at the University of Washington and the Department of Paleontology at the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture. They were some of the first mammals to diversify in this new post mass extinction world, taking advantage of the fruits and insects up in the forest canopy. Based on the age of the fossils, Professor Mantilla and colleagues estimate that the ancestor of all primates  including plesiadapiforms and todays primates  likely emerged by the Late Cretaceous epoch and lived alongside large dinosaurs. This was a really cool study to be a part of, particularly because it provides further evidence that the earliest primates originated before the extinction of non avian dinosaurs, said co author Brody Hovatter, a graduate student in the Department of Earth and Space Sciences at the University of Washington. They became highly abundant within a million years after that extinction. This discovery is exciting because it represents the oldest dated occurrence of archaic primates in the fossil record, added co lead author Dr. Stephen Chester, a researcher at Brooklyn College and the City University of New York. It adds to our understanding of how the earliest primates separated themselves from their competitors following the demise of the dinosaurs.

Ninjatitan zapatai belongs to Titanosauria, a diverse group of sauropod long necked plant eating dinosaurs. This group includes species ranging from the largest known terrestrial vertebrates to dwarfs no bigger than elephants. During evolutionary history, sauropods had different moments, different pulses of gigantism, which were not only related to the group of titanosaurs, said Dr. Pablo Ariel Gallina, a paleontologist at the Fundaci\u00f3n Azara in Maimonides University and CONICET. There were large animals towards the end of the Jurassic period, such as Apatosaurus and Brachiosaurus. And, already in the line of titanosaurs, the pulse with the largest giants occurs towards the middle of the Cretaceous period, with species such as Patagotitan, Argentinosaurus or Notocolossus. Ninjatitan zapatai was about 20 m 66 feet in length, and had a long neck and tail. The main importance of Ninjatitan zapatai, beyond the fact that it is a new species of titanosaur, is that it is the earliest record worldwide for this group, Dr. Gallina said. This discovery is also very important for the knowledge of the evolutionary history of sauropods, because the fossil records of the Early Cretaceous epoch, in around 140 million years ago, are really very scarce throughout the world. The 140 million year old postcranial remains of Ninjatitan zapatai were discovered in the Bajada Colorada Formation in Neuqu\u00e9n province, Patagonia region, Argentina. The presence of a basal titanosaurian sauropod in the lowermost Cretaceous of Patagonia supports the hypothesis that the group was established in the southern hemisphere and reinforces the idea of a Gondwanan origin for Titanosauria, the researchers said. The discovery of Ninjatitan zapatai is described in a paper in the journal Ameghiniana.

About 66 million years ago, the end Cretaceous mass extinction eradicated roughly 75 of the animal and plant species on Earth, including whole groups like non avian dinosaurs and ammonites. In the geologic record, this extinction event is marked by a thin layer of clay with elevated concentrations of iridium  a metal that occurs in higher concentrations in meteorites but only in low concentrations in Earths crust. First detected in Gubbio, Italy, and Caravaca, Spain, in the 1980s, the iridium layer was used to propose a large scale impact of an extraterrestrial body as the cause for the end Cretaceous extinction. In the 1990s, high energy deposits were identified around the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, culminating in the discovery of the 180  to 200 km wide Chicxulub crater on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico. In a new study, an international team of researchers found iridium in drill core recovered by IODP ICDP Expedition 364 from the Chicxulub impact structure. In the crater, the sediment layer deposited in the days to years after the strike is so thick that the scientists were able to precisely date the dust to a mere two decades after impact. The circle is now finally complete, said Professor Steven Goderis, a researcher at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. We are now at the level of coincidence that geologically doesnt happen without causation, said Professor Sean Gulick, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. It puts to bed any doubts that the iridium anomaly in the geologic layer is not related to the Chicxulub crater. The highest concentrations of iridium were found within a 5 cm section of the rock core retrieved from the top of the Chicxulub craters peak ring. In addition to iridium, the crater section showed elevated levels of other elements associated with asteroid material. This asteroid was vaporized and ejected from the impact site at high speed, said Professor Joanna Morgan, a researcher at Imperial College London. Iridium, and other asteroidal material, then circled the Earth above the stratosphere within a fast moving dust cloud, and may have taken up to two decades to settle through the atmosphere and ocean before being deposited at the impact site. We combined the results from four independent laboratories around the world to make sure we got this right, Professor Goderis said. The findings appear in the journal Science Advances.

Using this and other cave bear genomes, theyve determined nuclear and mitochondrial substitution rates and revised the evolutionary history of cave bears. The fossil analyzed by the team belongs to a Middle Pleistocene cave bear subspecies called Ursus kudarensis praekudarensis, which is thought to be ancestral to the Late Pleistocene Caucasian cave bear Ursus kudarensis kudarensis. The specimen was found in Kudaro 1 cave located in the Southern Caucasus in South Ossetia, Georgia. Our analysis of the whole genome data has revealed a new evolutionary history for cave bears, said Dr. Axel Barlow, a researcher at Nottingham Trent University and the University of Potsdam. He and his colleagues produced billions of individual short DNA sequences which represented a mixture of DNA from the cave bear and contaminants the bone had picked up over hundreds of thousands of years. Our study shows that this amazing molecule can survive even longer than previously thought, opening up new opportunities for genetic investigation over previously unimaginable timescales, Dr. Barlow said. We analyzed a petrous bone that was around seven times older than any we had previously studied, showing that genome data can be recovered from temperate zone samples spanning more than 300,000 years. To put this in context, this cave bear probably lived before our own species, Homo sapiens, even came into existence. The scientists then used computational analysis to sort the target sequences from the contamination, which is done my matching the short sequences to a reference genome of a related organism, in this case the polar bear. From a total of 2.6 billion sequenced molecules, we were able to map 2.1 Gb of sequence with high confidence to the reference genome assembly of the polar bear, they explained. In order to learn more about the evolution of cave bears, once they had the genome data for Ursus kudarensis praekudarensis, they were able to compare with others from between 35,000 and 70,000 years ago to provide broad sampling of all the major cave bear lineages. Because the time difference between the cave bear samples was so great, they were able to count how many DNA mutations had occurred during this period. From here they could calculate the rate of DNA mutation in the cave bear genome, as well as the time that the different lineages diverged. Using the newly calculated mutation rate, they found that cave bears and their living relatives  the brown bear and polar bear  diverged from a common ancestor about 1.5 million years ago. And while they had previously shown that cave bears interbred with brown bears, with the mutation rate they are now able to date these events. The authors found that cave bears exchanged mitochondrial DNA frequently during their evolution, which until now had obscured their true evolutionary relationships. They also found that many significant events in bear evolution may have been driven by major global climate change about one million years ago, when cold phases became longer and more intense and warm phases much shorter. We have been able to determine the mutation rate of the cave bear genome for the first time, Dr. Barlow said. Using this information, we have discovered that major climatic changes may have been a factor driving major evolutionary events in these giant bears. A paper on the findings was published in the journal Current Biology.

Their results, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, demonstrate that the animal belonged to a lineage of dogs that diverged from Siberian dogs around 16,700 years ago and may be a close relative of the earliest domesticated dogs that accompanied humans during their migrations to the New World. Pre contact American dogs arrived alongside people over 10,000 years ago and dispersed throughout North and South America. Illustration by John James Audubon and John Bachman 1845 1848. The 10,150 year old partial femur of an early dog was excavated from Lawyers Cave on the Alaskan mainland east of Wrangell Island in the Alexander Archipelago of southeast Alaska. Known as PP 00128, the specimen represents the oldest bone remains found in that cave, and is the oldest genetically confirmed dog discovered in the New World. Dr. Charlotte Lindqvist, an evolutionary biologist at the University at Buffalo, and colleagues extracted and sequenced mitochondrial genome from PP 00128 and compared it to those of modern dog breeds, historical Arctic dogs and American precontact dogs from before European arrival. Their analysis showed that the Southeast Alaskan dog shared a common ancestor about 16,000 years ago with American canines that lived before the arrival of European colonizers. We now have genetic evidence from an ancient dog found along the Alaskan coast, Dr. Lindqvist said. Because dogs are a proxy for human occupation, our data help provide not only a timing but also a location for the entry of dogs and people into the Americas. Our study supports the theory that this migration occurred just as coastal glaciers retreated during the last Ice Age. There have been multiple waves of dogs migrating into the Americas, but one question has been, when did the first dogs arrive? And did they follow an interior ice free corridor between the massive ice sheets that covered the North American continent, or was their first migration along the coast? The fossil record of ancient dogs in the Americas is incomplete, so any new remains that are found provide important clues, said Flavio Augusto da Silva Coelho, a Ph.D. student at the University at Buffalo. Before our study, the earliest ancient American dog bones that had their DNA sequenced were found in the U.S. Midwest. Carbon isotope analysis of the PP 00128 bone indicates that the dog likely had a marine diet, which may have consisted of foods such as fish and scraps from seals and whales. Canines did not arrive all at once. For example, some Arctic dogs arrived later from East Asia with the Thule culture, while Siberian huskies were imported to Alaska during the Gold Rush. Other dogs were brought to the Americas by European colonizers, Dr. Lindqvist said. Our early dog from Southeast Alaska supports the hypothesis that the first dog and human migration occurred through the Northwest Pacific coastal route instead of the central continental corridor, which is thought to have become viable only about 13,000 years ago, Coelho said.

Coelacanths are a group of primitive deep dwelling fish closely related to tetrapods, four limbed vertebrates including amphibians, mammals and reptiles. They were thought to have been extinct for 66 million years, until the accidental capture of a living specimen by a South African fisherman in 1938. Coelacanths first appeared in the Early Devonian epoch, diversified a little in the Devonian and Carboniferous period, and attained a maximum of diversity in the Early Triassic epoch. During the Cretaceous period, they are known by two families only, the Latimeriidae, which survived to the present with the genus Latimeria, and the\u00a0Mawsoniidae, which went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous. The newly discovered specimen belongs to the latter family, and is the last record of coelacanths before their pseudo extinction 66 million years ago. The thin bony plates were arranged like a barrel, but with the staves going round instead of from top to bottom, said Professor David Martill, a paleontologist in the School of the Environment, Geography and Geosciences at the University of Portsmouth. Only one animal has such a structure and that is the coelacanth  wed found a lung of this remarkable and bizarre looking fish. The fossil was recovered from the uppermost Cretaceous deposits of Oued Zem in Morocco. It had been embedded in a block of phosphate, backed with plaster and covered in a coating of lacquer, which had caused the bones to turn brown. It was found next to a pterodactyl which proves the giant coelacanth lived in the Cretaceous period. The specimen is also the first record of a marine coelacanth in the Mesozoic of Morocco and the first occurrence of coelacanths in the phospahte deposits of North Africa, the researchers said. The large size of the lung suggests the ancient fish estimated at between 3.65 m and 5.52 m\u00a012 18 feet total body length  substantially larger than modern day coelacanths, which only grow to a maximum length of 2 m 6.6 feet. We only had a single, albeit massive lung so our conclusions required some quite complex calculations, Professor Martill said. It was astonishing to deduce that this particular fish was enormous  quite a bit longer than the length of a stand up paddleboard and likely the largest coelacanth ever discovered. The study was published in the journal Cretaceous Research.

It is widely hypothesized that primeval life utilized small organic molecules as sources of carbon and energy, said lead author Dr. Helge Mi\u00dfbach from the University of Cologne and his colleagues. A potential source of these compounds includes recycled and redistributed organic matter from pre existing biomass. As yet, however, such primordial ingredients have not been found in rocks that directly testify to the emergence of life on our planet. In new research, Dr. Mi\u00dfbach and co authors examined primary fluid inclusions in 3.5 billion year old barites from the Dresser Formation in Western Australia. In the field, the barites are directly associated with fossilized microbial mats, and they smell like rotten eggs when freshly scratched, they explained. To explore the full range of volatiles in the barite hosted fluid inclusions, the researchers combined gas chromatography mass spectrometry, microthermometry, fluid inclusion petrography, and stable isotope analysis. They detected various compounds such as hydrogen sulfide H2S, carbonyl sulfide COS, carbon disulfide CS2, methane CH4, acetic acid, organic poly sulfanes, and thiols. While many compounds observed are consistent with an abiotic origin, the Dresser Formation also contains a variety of evidence for life. Thus, biology is another potential source for the observed compounds, they said. In fact, organisms synthesize most lipids on modern Earth, and carbon 13 signatures of kerogen in the black barite are in good accordance with biological carbon fixation. Furthermore, compounds such as H2S, COS, CS2, methylsulfanylmethane, methyldisulfanylmethane, and thiols are typically formed during microbial sulfur cycling in modern environments, and there is isotopic evidence for the presence of sulfur processing metabolisms during Dresser times. Taken together, it is likely that the barite hosted fluid inclusions contain mixtures of various abiotic and biotic compounds. The scientists also detected stable building blocks of methyl thioacetate methanethiol, acetic acid, a putative key agent in primordial energy metabolism and thus the emergence of life. In addition to potential nutrients andor substrates, hydrothermal fluids captured in the Dresser fluid inclusions contain molecules closely related to putative key agents in the emergence of life, they said. It has been proposed that carbon monoxide CO and methanethiol can react in the presence of catalytic metallic sulfides to methyl thioacetate. This compound, also known as activated acetic acid, was proposed as being important for the formation of lipids under primordial conditions and as an energy source for early microbial metabolisms. The results reveal an intriguing diversity of organic molecules with known or inferred metabolic relevance and provide a strong clue as to how hydrothermal fluids sustained microbial life 3.5 billion years ago. The immediate connection between primordial molecules emerging from the subsurface and microbial organisms  3.5 billion years ago  somehow surprised us, Dr. Mi\u00dfbach said. This finding contributes decisively to our understanding of the still unclear earliest evolutionary history of life on Earth. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.

The newly identified species lived approximately 25 million years ago, making it Australias known skink. Named Proegernia mikebulli, it belongs to Egerniinae, a large subfamily of social skinks  including living bluetongues, sleepy lizards shinglebacks, land mullets and spiny tailed skinks  within the family Scincidae. The species is named after Professor Michael Bull of Flinders University, South Australia, who devoted decades to documenting the ecology of Australias egerniine skinks, said lead author Dr. Kailah Thorn, a paleoherpetologist at the South Australian Museum and Flinders University, and colleagues. Several incomplete jaws of the ancient lizard were recovered from the Namba Formation outcropping at Lake Pinpa and Billeroo Creek, seven hours drive north of capital city Adelaide. The fossiliferous deposits of this formation also bear abundant aquatic such as fish, the giant platypus Obdurodon and waterfowl and land dwelling such as possums, dasyuromorphs and skinks vertebrates. Some of Australias most famous animals, including koalas and kangaroos, had been traced back to their fossil ancestors in remarkable finds in central South Australia, Dr. Thorn said. The significance of this site containing the ancestors of Australias early marsupials was already well established, but no fossil lizards had ever been found in the Namba Formation. It was 45 degrees Celsius in the shade that day and hard work digging through the clay, but it was definitely worth it once the tiniest of bone fragments turned out to be those of the oldest Australian skink. Fossil lizards are often too small to be identified when youre in the field and lizard skulls are made of more than 20 individual bones that all disarticulate when they fossilize, Dr. Thorn added. The discovery of the tiny fossil lizards in an area the size of one million soccer fields was enabled by building an understanding of the geology of the region, and targeting bands of silt to sieve and sort back at the lab. The teams paper was published in the journal Royal Societys Open Science. "}, {"title": " Researchers Sequence 1.2-Million-Year-Old Mammoth DNA", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Feb 17, 2021", "doc": "An international team of scientists has sequenced and analyzed DNA from three mammoth specimens, two of which are more than one million years old. The results show that two distinct mammoth lineages were present in eastern Siberia during the Early Pleistocene one of these lineages gave rise to the woolly mammoth Mammuthus primigenius and the other represents a previously unrecognized lineage that was ancestral to the first mammoths to colonize North America the Columbian mammoth Mammuthus columbi traces its ancestry to a Middle Pleistocene hybridization between these two lineages. Mammoths appeared in Africa approximately 5 million years ago, and subsequently colonized much of the northern hemisphere. During the Pleistocene epoch 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago, the mammoth lineage underwent evolutionary changes that produced the southern mammoth Mammuthus meridionalis and the steppe mammoth Mammuthus trogontherii, which later gave rise to Columbian and woolly mammoths. Although the exact relationships among these species are uncertain, the prevailing view is that the Columbian mammoth evolved during an early colonization of North America about 1.5 million years ago and that the woolly mammoth first appeared in northeastern Siberia about 700,000 years ago. Mammoths similar to the steppe mammoth inhabited Eurasia from at least around 1.7 million years ago the last populations went extinct in Europe about 200,000 years ago. To investigate the origin and evolution of woolly and Columbian mammoths, Professor Love Dal\u00e9n and colleagues recovered genomic data from three mammoth molars dubbed Chukochya, Krestovka and Adycha from northeastern Siberia that date to 700,000 1.2 million years ago  the oldest genomic data recovered so far. This DNA is incredibly old. The samples are a thousand times older than Viking remains, and even pre date the existence of humans and Neanderthals, said Professor Dal\u00e9n, a researcher at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm University and the Centre for Palaeogenetics. The results show that the 1.2 million year old Krestovka mammoth belonged to a previously unknown genetic lineage that diverged from other Siberian mammoths more than 2 million years ago. This came as a complete surprise to us. All previous studies have indicated that there was only one species of mammoth in Siberia at that point in time, called the steppe mammoth, said Dr. Tom van der Valk, a researcher at Stockholm University, the Centre for Palaeogenetics and Uppsala University. But our DNA analyses now show that there were two different genetic lineages, which we here refer to as the Adycha mammoth and the Krestovka mammoth. We cant say for sure yet, but we think these may represent two different species. The researchers suggest that mammoths from the Krestovka lineage colonized North America some 1.5 million years ago. The results also show that the Columbian mammoth that inhabited North America during the last Ice Age was a hybrid. Roughly half of its genome came from the Krestovka lineage and the other half from the woolly mammoth. This is an important discovery. It appears that the Columbian mammoth, one of the most iconic Ice Age species of North America, evolved through a hybridization that took place approximately 420,000 years ago, said Dr. Patr\u00edcia Pec\u030cnerova\u0301, a researcher at Stockholm University, the Centre for Palaeogenetics and the University of Copenhagen. The results also indicate that gene variants associated with life in the Arctic, such as hair growth, thermoregulation, fat deposits, cold tolerance and circadian rhythms, were already present in the 1 million year old mammoth, long before the origin of the woolly mammoth. Most adaptations in the mammoth lineage happened slowly and gradually over time. To be able to trace genetic changes across a speciation event is unique, said Dr. David Di\u0301ez del Molino, a researcher at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm University and the Centre for Palaeogenetics. Our analyses show that most cold adaptations were present already in the ancestor of the woolly mammoth, and we find no evidence that natural selection was faster during the speciation process. The findings were published today in the journal Nature. "}, {"title": " Novel Theory Explains Possible Origin of Dinosaur-Killing Chicxulub Impactor", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Feb 16, 2021", "doc": "At the end of the Cretaceous period, about 66 million years ago, a 10 km impactor crashed into Earth near the site of the small town of Chicxulub in what is now Mexico. The impact unleashed an incredible amount of climate changing gases into the atmosphere, triggering a chain of events that led to the extinction of non avian dinosaurs and 75 of life on the planet. In a new paper published in the journal Scientific Reports, Harvard University astrophysicists Amir Siraj and Professor Avi Loeb put forth a new theory that could explain the origin and journey of the Chicxulub impactor. A popular theory on the origin of the Chicxulub impactor claims that the object originated from the main belt, which is an asteroid population between the orbit of Jupiter and Mars. Evidence found at the Chicxulub crater suggests the rock was composed of carbonaceous chondrite. However, carbonaceous chondrites are rare amongst main belt asteroids, but possibly widespread amongst long period comets, providing additional support to the cometary impact hypothesis. Using statistical analysis and gravitational simulations, Siraj and Professor Loeb calculate that a significant fraction of long period comets originating from the Oort cloud, an icy sphere of debris at the edge of the Solar System, can be bumped off course by Jupiters gravitational field during orbit. The Solar System acts as a kind of pinball machine. Jupiter, the most massive planet, kicks incoming long period comets into orbits that bring them very close to the Sun, Siraj said.  During close passage to the Sun, the comets  nicknamed sungrazers  can experience powerful tidal forces that break apart pieces of the rock and ultimately, produce cometary shrapnel. In a sungrazing event, the portion of the comet closer to the sun feels a stronger gravitational pull than the part that is further, resulting in a tidal force across the object, Siraj said. You can get whats called a tidal disruption event, in which a large comet breaks up into many smaller pieces. And crucially, on the journey back to the Oort cloud, theres an enhanced probability that one of these fragments hit the Earth. The new calculations increase the chances of long period comets impacting Earth by a factor of about 10, and show that about 20 of long period comets become sungrazers. This rate is consistent with the age of Chicxulub, providing a satisfactory explanation for its origin and other impactors like it. Our paper provides a basis for explaining the occurrence of this event, Professor Loeb said. We are suggesting that, in fact, if you break up an object as it comes close to the Sun, it could give rise to the appropriate event rate and also the kind of impact that killed the dinosaurs.

Named Yezoceras elegans, the new ammonite species swam in the Cretaceous seas between 89 and 86 million years ago. This is the first species of the genus Yezoceras to be discovered in 44 years, said lead author Dr. Daisuke Aiba and his colleagues from the Mikasa City Museum and Yokohama National University. Yezoceras elegans belongs to the family Nostoceratidae, a diverse group of heteromorph ammonites known for the bizarre coiling of their shells. The species had loosely coiled whorls, a wide umbilicus, and two prominent tubercle rows concentrated in the lower part of the whorls. Nostoceratidae includes more than 15 genera, Dr. Aiba said. Many genera belonging to this family have basically helically coiled whorls, others have three dimensionally meandered whorls. Dr. Aiba and co authors found eight specimens of Yezoceras elegans in the Haboro area in Hokkaido, northern Japan. They think that this and two other species in the genus, Yezoceras nodosum and Yezoceras miotuberculatum, were endemic to the northwestern Pacific region. Yezoceras elegans might have originated from Yezoceras nodosum, judging from the stratigraphic correlation, they said. The restricted occurrences of three Yezoceras species in Hokkaido suggest that the speciation of Yezoceras occurred in the northwestern Pacific realm during the Coniacian age. The discovery of Yezoceras elegans is reported in a paper in the journal Paleontological Research. "}, {"title": " Study: First Flowering Plants Appeared in Jurassic Period or Even Earlier", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Feb 9, 2021", "doc": "Flowering plants angiosperms are the most diverse of all land plants, becoming abundant in the Cretaceous period 145 to 66 million years ago and achieving dominance in the Cenozoic 66 million years ago present. However, the exact timing of their origin remains a controversial topic. To resolve this discrepancy, a team of paleontologists from Europe and China estimated the ages of angiosperm families on the basis of the fossil record and their living diversity. Their results, published in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution, support Charles Darwins hypothesis of a rapid Cretaceous diversification of angiosperms and indicate that several families originated in the Jurassic, strongly rejecting a Cretaceous origin for the group. Ubiquitous across terrestrial and aquatic systems, angiosperms are the most diverse group of land plants on Earth today. Fossil evidence indicates that angiosperms and their system group, gymnosperms, had already diverged by the Late Carboniferous epoch 306.2 million years ago. The earliest known fossil evidence of crown angiosperms dates to the Early Cretaceous epoch 135 million years ago, but the true time of their origin remains debated. The sudden appearance of crown angiosperm fossils, apparently without forebears displaying evidence of the gradual assembly of the angiosperm body plan, was considered an abominable mystery by Charles Darwin and his contemporaries. A diverse group of flowering plants had been living for a very long time shadowed by ferns and gymnosperms, which were dominating ancient ecosystems, said Dr. Daniele Silvestro, a researcher at the University of Fribourg, the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, the University of Gothenburg, and the Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre. This reminds me of how modern mammals lived for a long time laying low in the age of dinosaurs, before becoming a dominant component of modern faunas. While we do not expect our study to put an end to the debate about angiosperm origin, it does provide a strong motivation for what some consider a hunt for the snark  a Jurassic flowering plant, added Professor Philip Donoghue, a researcher at the University of Bristol. Rather than a mythical artifact of genome based analyses, Jurassic angiosperms are an expectation of our interpretation of the fossil record. The teams conclusions are based on complex modeling using a large global database of fossil occurrences, which the team compiled from more than 700 publications. These records, amounting to more than 15,000, included members of many groups of plants including representatives of palms, orchids, sunflowers, and peas. Scientific debate has long been polarized between paleontologists who estimate the antiquity of angiosperms based on the age of the oldest fossils, versus molecular biologists who use this information to calibrate molecular evolution to geologic time, said Dr. Christine Bacon, a researcher at the University of Gothenburg and the Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre. Our study shows that these views are too simplistic the fossil record has to be interpreted. A literal reading of the fossil record cannot be used to estimate realistically the time of origin of a group. Instead, we had to develop new mathematical models and use computer simulations to solve this problem in a robust way. Understanding when flowering plants went from being an insignificant group into becoming the cornerstone of most terrestrial ecosystems shows us that nature is dynamic, said Professor Alexandre Antonelli, a researcher at the University of Gothenburg, the Gothenburg Global Biodiversity Centre, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and the University of Oxford. The devastating human impact on climate and biodiversity could mean that the successful species in the future will be very different to the ones we are accustomed to now.

Megatherium is an extinct genus of ground sloths that lived in South America from the Early Pliocene epoch 5 million years ago through the end of the Pleistocene epoch 11,700 years ago. The earliest and smallest known species of the genus is Megatherium altiplanicum from Pliocene of Bolivia. But it is best known for the elephant sized Megatherium americanum, sometimes called the giant ground sloth, native to Argentina, Uruguay and Bolivia during the Pleistocene. It was up to 10 times the size of living sloths reaching weights of up to 4 tons. It was able to stand and walk on its hind legs, making it the largest bipedal mammal of all time. Megatherium overlapped with humans in time as their fossils have been found with cut marks on them, suggesting that these creatures were on the menu thousands of years ago. Footprints attributed to Megatherium americanum dating to around 14,000 years old have been found in Argentina. These animals lived mostly in groups, but they may have lived singly in caves. They probably had mainly a browsing diet in open habitats, but also they probably fed on other moderate to soft tough food. There even have been suggestions that their long claws and strong forelimbs may have allowed them to hunt other animals. Megatherium remains are very common in almost the entire Argentine territory, however, it is the first time that the remains of such high antiquity have been found, which is only comparable to a find made a few years ago in Bolivia, said Dr. Nicol\u00e1s Chimento from the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales Bernardino Rivadavia CONICET and his colleagues from the Museo Municipal Punta Hermengo, Miramar, the Universidad Maim\u00f3nides, CICYTTP CONICET, and CIC PBA UNMDP. The new, partial skull of a Megatherium was discovered at the locality of San Eduardo del Mar in Argentinas Buenos Aires province. The paleontologists found that the fossil belonged to a juvenile and is at least 3.58 million years old. This constitutes the first undoubted record of Megatherium from the Pliocene of Argentina, and one of the oldest records for the genus, they said. This finding blurs previous biogeographical proposals sustaining that the genus originated in the High Andes and later dispersed to the lowlands. On the contrary, present finding, together with the record of coeval Megatherium species in the Pleistocene of the Argentine Pampas, suggests a more complex paleobiogeographical scenario and indicates that the diversity of lowland Pliocene megatheriines is still underrepresented. The findings were published in the Journal of South American Earth Sciences.

Most placoderms had less complex inner ear structures, with a large sac, called a vestibule, placed in the center and separating all the other components. Brindabellaspis stensioi was first found in 1980 in limestone around Lake Burrinjuck in New South Wales, Australia, an area containing some of the worlds earliest known reef fish fauna. Nicknamed platypus fish, it had a long snout, reminiscent of a platypus bill. It belongs to Placodermi placoderms, a class of armored fish which thrived for 60 million years of the early Paleozoic era, between 420 and 360 million years ago. The inner ear structure of Brindabellaspis stensioi is so delicate and fragile that it is rarely preserved in fossils, so being able to use these new techniques to re examine specimens and discover this wealth of new information is very exciting, said Dr. Sam Giles, a researcher in the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Birmingham and the Department of Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museum, London. Using cutting edge microCT scanning, Dr. Giles and colleagues examined several specimens of Brindabellaspis stensioi recovered from an ancient reef near the Brindabella Moutains on the border of New South Wales. The fossils were unusually well preserved, giving the paleontologists a rare opportunity to examine inside the brain cavity. Their early analysis led them to conclude these fish were closely related to primitive, jawless fishes that first appeared some 500 million years ago. The more recent analysis, however, challenges assumptions that placoderms were a distinct group and supports the possibility that they, in fact, contained the origins of modern jawed vertebrates. This fossil has revealed a really intriguing mosaic of primitive features and a surprisingly modern inner ear, Dr. Giles said. We dont yet know for certain what this means in terms of our understanding of how modern jawed vertebrates evolved, but its likely that virtual anatomy techniques are going to be a critical tool for piecing together this fascinating jigsaw puzzle. Which hypothesis is closer to the truth? The simple answer is we dont know yet, said Dr. Youan Zhu, a researcher at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Department of Organismal Biology at Uppsala University. Molecular data suggest that jawed vertebrates arose in the Middle Ordovician, some 60 million years before\u00a0Brindabellaspis stensioi was cruising the ancient reefs. The answer may be in that missing 60 million year period, in which fossils are very rare. The findings were published in the journal Current Biology.

The Ediacaran period fungus like fossils were found in small cavities within well studied sedimentary dolostone rocks of the Doushantuo Formation at Wengan, South China. It was an accidental discovery. At that moment, we realized that this could be the fossil that scientists have been looking for a long time, said Tian Gan, a Ph.D. student at the Virginia Tech. If our interpretation is correct, it will be helpful for understanding the paleoclimate change and early life evolution. The Doushantuo microfossils are pyritized but contain trace amount of organic matter. They include branching filaments of two morphological types and associated hollow spheres. The filaments are hundreds of microns in length at the minimum, and can be straight, curved, or bent. The teams analysis indicates that they likely represent fungal microorganisms that colonized karstic environments sometime between 635 and 632 million years ago. They may have played a role in catalyzing atmospheric oxygenation and biospheric evolution in the aftermath of the catastrophic snowball Earth event. About 635 million years ago, when the Ediacaran period began, our planet was recovering from the\u00a0Cryogenian global glaciation, the researchers said. At that time, ocean surfaces were frozen to a depth of more than a kilometer and it was an incredibly harsh environment for virtually any living organism, except for some microscopic life that managed to thrive. Scientists have long wondered how life ever returned to normalcy and how the biosphere was able to grow larger and more complex than ever before. With this new fossil in hand, we are certain that these microscopic, low profile cave dwellers played numerous roles in the reconditioning of the terrestrial environment in the Ediacaran time. Although previous evidence stated that terrestrial plants and fungi formed a symbiotic relationship around 400 million years ago, the\u00a0teams discovery recalibrates the timeline of when these two kingdoms colonized the land. The question used to be Were there fungi in the terrestrial realm before the rise of terrestrial plants?, said Professor Shuhai Xiao, also from the Virginia Tech. And I think our study suggests yes. Our fungus like fossil is 240 million years older than the previous record. This is, thus far, the oldest record of terrestrial fungi.

The Americas were one of the last regions in the world to be settled by people. By this same time, dogs had been domesticated from gray wolf ancestors and were likely playing a variety of roles within human societies. When and where have long been questions in dog domestication research, but here we also explored the how and why, which have often been overlooked, said lead author Dr. Angela Perri, a researcher in the Department of Archaeology at Durham University. Dog domestication occurring in Siberia answers many of the questions weve always had about the origins of the human dog relationship. By putting together the puzzle pieces of archaeology, genetics and time we see a much clearer picture where dogs are being domesticated in Siberia, then disperse from there into the Americas and around the world. The only thing we knew for sure is that dog domestication did not take place in the Americas, added co author Dr. Laurent Frantz, a researcher in the Department of Veterinary Sciences at the Ludwig Maximilian University and the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences at Queen Mary University of London. From the genetic signatures of ancient dogs, we now know that they must have been present somewhere in Siberia before people migrated to the Americas. The combined evidence from ancient humans and dogs is helping to refine our understanding of the deep history of dogs, and now points toward Siberia and Northeast Asia as a likely region where dog domestication was initiated, said co author Professor Greger Larson, a researcher in the Research Laboratory for Archaeology and History of Art at the University of Oxford. During the most recent Ice Age, from 23,000 19,000 years ago, Beringia and most of Siberia were extremely cold, dry, and largely unglaciated. The harsh climatic conditions leading up to, and during this period may have served to bring human and gray wolf populations into close proximity given their attraction to the same prey. This increasing interaction, through mutual scavenging of kills from wolves drawn to human campsites, may have began a relationship between the species that eventually led to dog domestication, and a vital role in the populating of the Americas. We have long known that the first Americans must have possessed well honed hunting skills, the geological know how to find stone and other necessary materials and been ready for new challenges, said co author Dr. David Meltzer, an archaeologist in the Department of Anthropology at Southern Methodist University and the GLOBE Institute at the University of Copenhagen. The dogs that accompanied them as they entered this completely new world may have been as much a part of their cultural repertoire as the stone tools they carried.

Parasaurolophus is a genus of herbivorous ornithopod dinosaurs that is most strikingly characterized by a tubular crest. Three currently recognized species, Parasaurolophus walkeri, P. tubicen, and P. cyrtocristatus, lived in what is now North America, about 76.5 73 million years ago Cretaceous period. Unlike Parasaurolophus walkeri and P. tubicen, which have long slightly curving crests, P. cyrtocristatus is unique in having a shorter crest that curves sharply over the back end of the skull roof. Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus was previously known from a single, partial specimen collected in New Mexico in 1923 by legendary fossil hunter Charles H. Sternberg. The new skull was discovered in 2017 in the Fossil Forest Member of the Fruitland Formation in northwestern New Mexico. The preservation of this new skull is spectacular, finally revealing in detail the bones that make up the crest of this amazing dinosaur known by nearly every dinosaur obsessed kid, said co author Dr. Joe Sertich, curator of dinosaurs at the Denver Museum of Nature  Science. This just reinforces the importance of protecting our public lands for scientific discoveries. My jaw dropped when I first saw the fossil.

This specimen is truly remarkable in its preservation, said co author Dr. David Evans, the Temerty chair in vertebrate paleontology and vice president of natural history at the Royal Ontario Museum. It has answered long standing questions about how the crest is constructed and about the validity of this particular species. For me, this fossil is very exciting. About 75 million years ago, when Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus lived in the region, North America was divided into two landmasses by a broad seaway. Laramidia, the ribbon of land to the west, extended from todays Alaska to central Mexico, hosting multiple episodes of mountain building in early stages of the construction of todays Rocky Mountains. These mountain building events helped preserve diverse ecosystems of dinosaurs along their eastern flanks, some of the best preserved and most continuous anywhere on Earth. Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus shared lush, subtropical floodplains with other, crestless duck billed dinosaurs, a diverse array of horned dinosaurs, and early tyrannosaurs alongside many emerging, modern groups of alligators, turtles and plants. The skull of Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus is still incompletely known, so more complete material will likely reveal new features that further differentiate this species and aid in determining the pace of ornamental crest evolution, the paleontologists said. The findings were published in the journal PeerJ.

Spinosaurus is a giant theropod dinosaur that lived in what is now North Africa, about 95 million years ago Cretaceous period. Since its discovery in 1915, the biology and behavior of this ancient creature has puzzled paleontologists worldwide. It was recently argued that Spinosaurus was largely a pursuit predator of aquatic prey, using its large tail to swim and actively pursue fish in the water. The new study challenges this view, suggesting that whilst it likely fed from the water, and may have swum, it wasnt well adapted to the life of an aquatic pursuit predator. The biology and ecology of Spinosaurus has been troubling paleontologists for decades, said lead author Dr. David Hone, a paleontologist at Queen Mary University of London. Some recent studies have suggested that it was actively chasing fish in water but while they could swim, they would not have been fast or efficient enough to do this effectively. Our findings suggest that the wading idea is much better supported, even if it is slightly less exciting. Dr. Hone and his colleague, Dr. Tom Holtz, compared the features of Spinosaurus with the skulls and skeletons of other dinosaurs and various living and extinct reptiles that lived on land, in the water or did both. They found that whilst there were several pieces of evidence that contradicted the aquatic pursuit predator concept, none contradicted the wading heron like model, and various lines of evidence actively supported it. Spinosaurus was a bizarre animal even by dinosaur standards, and unlike anything alive today, so trying to understand its ecology will always be difficult, Dr. Holtz said. We sought to use what evidence we have to best approximate its way of life. And what we found did not match the attributes one would expect in an aquatic pursuit predator in the manner of an otter, sea lion, or short necked plesiosaur. Spinosaurus had fewer tail muscles than a crocodile, and due to its size would have a lot more drag in the water. Crocodiles are excellent in water compared to land animals, but are not that specialized for aquatic life and are not able to actively chase after fish, Dr. Hone said. If Spinosaurus had fewer muscles on the tail, less efficiency and more drag then its h ard to see how these dinosaurs could be chasing fish in a way that crocodiles cannot. Whilst our study provides us with a clearer picture of the ecology and behavior of Spinosaurus, there are still many outstanding questions and details to examine for future study and we must continue to review our ideas as we accumulate further evidence and data on these unique dinosaurs. This wont be the last word on the biology of these amazing animals. The teams paper was published online in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

Polydolopidae is a family of extinct marsupials that lived in the Antarctic Peninsula and South America, including Chile, Argentine, Brazil, and Bolivia, during the Paleogene period. First described by Florentino Ameghino in 1897, these animals appeared at the beginning of the Paleocene epoch, about 66 million years ago, and disappeared during the Oligocene epoch, about 23 million years ago. They likely went extinct due to climatic deterioration in the Early Oligocene, when temperature and the humidity dropped, provoking desertification in the region where polydolopids evolved. In the past, South American marsupials were much more abundant than they are today, with hundreds of species of widely varying shapes and sizes, Dr. Chornogubsky said. Despite the fact that the debate is still open, some of the hypotheses focus on the relationship of polydolopids with Australian marsupials. The polydolopids could have evolved on a large continental mass without major barriers that isolated them. For this reason, the current records of Antarctica show us remains of these groups. Dr. Chornogubsky carried out a new taxonomic and systematic revision and the first extensive phylogenetic analysis of the Polydolopidae family. She examined the fossilized remains of almost every polydolopid species and five related marsupials Bonapartherium hinakusijum, Epidolops ameghinoi, Microbiotherium tehuelchum, Prepidolops didelphoides, and Roberthoffstetteria nationalgeographica. The Polydolopidae was recovered as a monophyletic group, even though no resolution about its sister group can be found, she said. Dr. Chornogubsky redescribed seven previously known genera of polydolopids Antarctodolops, Amphidolops, Archaeodolops, Eudolops, Kramadolops, Pliodolops, and Pseudolops. She also described one new genus, Hypodolops, two yet to be named genera, and three new species Hypodolops sapoensis, Amphidolops intermedius, and Amphidolops minimus. This research piece shows advances in the understanding of the evolutionary history of marsupials, Dr. Chornogubsky said. The study was published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. "}, {"title": " Tyrannosaur Hatchlings Were as Big as Medium-Sized Dog", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jan 26, 2021", "doc": "An international team of paleontologists has examined the fossilized remains of baby tyrannosaurid dinosaurs found in Alberta, Canada, and Montana, the United States. Tyrannosaurids were the apex predators of the supercontinent Laurasia in the Late Cretaceous epoch, and were among the largest terrestrial predators ever. These dinosaurs have garnered considerable interest since their discovery, both in the popular and scientific realms. As a result, they are well studied and much is known of their anatomy, diversity, growth, and evolution. In contrast, little is known of the earliest stages of their development. Tyrannosaurid eggs and embryos remain elusive, and juvenile specimens  although known  are rare. Tyrannosaurs are represented by dozens of skeletons and thousands of isolated bones or partial skeletons, said co author Mark Powers, a Ph.D. student at the University of Alberta. But despite this wealth of data for tyrannosaur biology, the smallest identifiable individuals are aged three to four years old, much larger than when they would have hatched. In the new research, Powers and colleagues examined 75 to 71.5 million year old fossilized jaw bone, tooth and claw of baby tyrannosaurids. A perinatal tooth and an embryonic claw from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta are probably attributable to Albertosaurus sarcophagus, they said. From the Two Medicine Formation of Montana, an embryonic jaw with teeth probably pertains to Daspletosaurus horneri. They provide information on the size of tyrannosaurid hatchlings and some preliminary clues to the nesting habits of tyrannosaurids. The paleontologists found that baby tyrannosaurs were around 0.9 m 3 feet long when they hatched. There were two surprising results, Powers said. The first is that the small tyrannosaur teeth were distinct from the teeth of older individuals  having not yet developed true serrations along the cutting edge of its teeth, as is iconic of the juveniles all the way through to adults. The second was the estimated size of the embryos. The specimen belonging to the claw was estimated to be about 1.1 m 3.6 feet long, while that of the jaw bone was about 71 cm 2.3 feet. Their findings also suggest that tyrannosaur eggs  the remains of which have never been found  were around 43 cm 17 inches long. This could aid efforts to recognize such eggs in the future and gain greater insights into the nesting habits of tyrannosaurs. The discovery of embryonic material is a huge find in our efforts to understand how some of the most popular and charismatic dinosaurs began their life, and grew to immense sizes, Powers said. It provides a much needed  and until now, missing  data point depicting the starting point for tyrannosaur growth. The researchers also found that the 3 cm  1.2 inch long jaw bone of Daspletosaurus horneri had distinctive tyrannosaur features, including a pronounced chin, indicating that these physical traits were present before the animals hatched. These bones are the first window into the early lives of tyrannosaurs and they teach us about the size and appearance of baby tyrannosaurs, said lead author Dr. Greg Funston, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh. We now know that they would have been the largest hatchlings to ever emerge from eggs, and they would have looked remarkably like their parents  both good signs for finding more material in the future. A paper on the findings was published in the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences.

Paleontologists know that most modern praying mantises, with their characteristic grasping forelegs, look very different from their oldest fossil ancestors. However, it has been difficult for them to trace mantis evolution more precisely because of the multiple gaps in the fossil record of these insects, combined with the very different anatomies of the three most primitive modern mantis groups Chaeteessidae, Mantoididae and Metallyticidae. The new mantis species, Labradormantis guilbaulti, lived in the Canadian Subarctic around 100 million years ago Late Cretaceous epoch. Its fossil wings were found at the Redmond Mine locality near Schefferville in Labrador, Canada. By using reflectance transformation imaging, Dr. Alexandre Demers Potvin of McGill Universitys Redpath Museum and colleagues were able to get a better view of the intricate network of veins lying along the fossil wings. They noticed a vein lying along the hind wings folding line called AA2 that is only found in one modern mantis lineage, the Chaeteessidae family. Following this observation, they produced a revised evolutionary tree that included Labradormantis guilbaulti among some of its living and extinct relatives. The identification of this single vein in the new species suggested that this structure had not evolved among Chaeteessidae in isolation, but that it was present in extinct relatives of modern mantises as well. Its very rare to advance our understanding of insect evolution without seeing a complete insect specimen trapped in amber, said co author Dr. Hans Larsson, also from McGill Universitys Redpath Museum. In our paper, we present a very rare case in which a less well preserved fossil has a similarly high impact. We hope that this study inspires investigations of other wing impression fossils to address similar questions elsewhere in the insect evolutionary tree.

Paleontologists from the United Kingdom and the United States have now described the cloacal opening of Psittacosaurus, an ornithischian dinosaur that lived about 110 million years ago Early Cretaceous epoch in what is now China, and compared it to vents across modern land dwelling vertebrate animals. Dr. Jakob Vinther from the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol and colleagues examined an exceptionally well preserved specimen of Psittacosaurus sp. from the Early Cretaceous Jehol deposits of Liaoning, China. The fossil is currently housed at the Senckenberg Museum in Frankfurt, Germany. I noticed the cloaca several years ago after we had reconstructed the color patterns of this dinosaur using a remarkable fossil on display at the Senckenberg Museum which clearly preserves its skin and color patterns, Dr. Vinther said. It took a long while before we got around to finish it off because no one has ever cared about comparing the exterior of cloacal openings of living animals, so it was largely unchartered territory. Indeed, they are pretty non descript, said co author Dr. Diane Kelly, a researcher in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. We found the vent does look different in many different groups of tetrapods, but in most cases it doesnt tell you much about an animals sex. Those distinguishing features are tucked inside the cloaca, and unfortunately, theyre not preserved in this fossil. The cloaca of Psittacosaurus is unique in its appearance but exhibits features reminiscent to living crocodylians such as alligators and crocodiles, which are the closest living relatives to dinosaurs and other birds. Its outer margins are highly pigmented with melanin. This pigmentation provided the vent with a function in display and signaling, similar to living baboons and some breeding salamanders. The large, pigmented lobes on either side of the opening could have harbored musky scent glands, as seen in living crocodylians. Birds are one the few vertebrate groups that occasionally exhibit visual signaling with the cloaca, which the study authors now can extend back to the Mesozoic dinosaur ancestors. As a paleoartist, it has been absolutely amazing to have an opportunity to reconstruct one of the last remaining features we didnt know anything about in dinosaurs, said Robert Nicholls, of Paleocreations. Knowing that at least some dinosaurs were signaling to each other gives paleoartists exciting freedom to speculate on a whole variety of now plausible interactions during dinosaur courtship.

"}, {"title": " Cretaceous Mosasaur Had Shark-Like Cutting Teeth", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jan 20, 2021", "doc": "A bizarre new genus and species of mosasaur with teeth unlike those of any known reptile has been identified from fossils found in Morocco. The mosasaurs were a group of lizards that became highly specialized for marine life in the mid Cretaceous period. By the end of the Cretaceous, these creatures had undergone an adaptive diversification, and showed a wide range of body sizes, movement styles, and diets. Their ranks included fish eaters, apex predators, and hard eaters. The new mosasaur species lived during the Maastrichtian stage of the Creataceous, approximately 69 million years ago. Scientifically named Xenodens calminechari, it was about the size of a small porpoise. About 66 million years ago, the coasts of Africa were the most dangerous seas in the world, said Dr. Nick Longrich, a paleontologist at the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath. Predator diversity there was unlike anything seen anywhere else on the planet. The new mosasaur adds to a rapidly growing list of marine reptiles known from the latest Cretaceous of Morocco, which at the time was submerged beneath a tropical sea. A huge diversity of mosasaurs lived here. Some were giant, deep diving predators like modern sperm whales, others with huge teeth and growing up to 10 m long, were top predators like orcas, still others ate shellfish like modern sea otters  and then there was the strange little Xenodens calminechari. They coexisted with long necked plesiosaurs, giant sea turtles, and saber toothed fish. The new mosasaur adds another dangerous predator to the mix. Xenodens calminechari had knifelike teeth that were packed edge to edge to make a serrated blade and resemble those of certain sharks. The cutting teeth let the ancient animal punch above its weight, cutting fish in half and taking large bites from bigger animals. Similar to living sleeper sharks and related dogfish sharks, the unusual jaws allowed Xenodens calminechari to punch above its weight, cutting small fish in half, carving pieces out of larger prey, and perhaps even scavenging on the carcasses of large marine reptiles, the researchers said. But rather than being an extreme specialist, the teeth probably let Xenodens calminechari eat a huge range of prey. A mosasaur with shark teeth is a novel adaptation of mosasaurs so surprising that it looked like a fantastic creature out of an artists imagination, said Dr. Nour Eddine Jalil, a paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and the Universite Cadi Ayyad. Xenodens calminechari is further evidence of the extraordinary paleobiodiversity of the Phosphate Sea. The discovery of Xenodens calminechari is reported in a paper published in the journal Cretaceous Research.

Chinatichampsus wilsonorum roamed our planet about 42 million years ago, during the Middle Eocene epoch. Its partial skull was discovered in 2010 at the Dalquest Desert Research Site in Brewster County, Texas, the United States. This caiman seems out of place, said Dr. Christopher Brochu, a paleontologist in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Iowa. Roughly 56 million years ago, Earth was experiencing temperatures so hot and methane levels so high that no polar ice caps could form. For large cool blooded reptiles like alligators and caimans, it was their time to thrive and soak up the Sun. In fact, the conditions were so favorable that these early reptiles roamed as far north as northern Canada. Caimans today are a South American radiation, and data from modern forms, including DNA, would suggest a very simple single origin from a North American ancestor, Dr. Brochu said. This new form, along with some older North American fossil caimans, suggests a far more complex early history with multiple crossings of the seaway that separated North and South America until fairly recently. The presence of a fossil caiman about 1,200 km 746 miles north of where caimans are found today, really says something about how different the climate of West Texas was in the middle Eocene, said Dr. Chris Kirk, a paleontologist in the Department of Anthropology and the Jackson School Museum of Earth History at the University of Texas at Austin. But one epoch later, in the Oligocene, the entire world was experiencing cooler temperatures, forcing many species that require warm and humid conditions into more restricted geographic ranges. Any fossil that we find has unique information that it contributes to understanding the history of life, said Dr. Michelle Stocker, a paleontologist in the Department of Geosciences at Virginia Tech. From what we have, we are able to understand a little bit more about the evolutionary history of caimans and the alligatorid group, which includes alligators and caimans.

Bioluminescence, the production of light by living organisms, evolved over 30 times independently on diverse branches of the tree of life including algae, cnidarians, fishes and marine worms. On land, light producing beetles are the most widespread and abundant bioluminescent organisms. Their elaborate flash displays play a role in mate recognition as well as in signaling, communication and luring prey. The majority of these beetles  over 2,300 species  belong to the megadiverse superfamily Elateroidea fireflies, fire beetles, glow worms. The evolution of bioluminescence in these beetles is associated with unusual morphological modifications, such as soft bodiedness and neoteny delaying or slowing of the physiological development, but the fragmentary nature of their fossil record discloses little about the origin of these adaptations. Most light producing beetles are soft bodied and quite small, and so have a scant fossil record, said Dr. Chenyang Cai, a researcher in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol and the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology and the Centre for Excellence in Life and Palaeoenvironment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. However, the new fossil, found in amber from northern Myanmar, is exceptionally well preserved, even the light organ on its abdomen is intact. Elateroidea is one of the most heterogeneous groups of beetles and that has always been very difficult for entomologists to deal with, particularly because important anatomical innovations evolved many times independently in unrelated groups, said Dr. Erik Tihelka, a researcher in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol. The discovery of a new extinct elateroid beetle family is significant because it helps shed light on the evolution of these fascinating beetles. A specimen of Burmese amber with Cretophengodes azari came from amber mines near the Noije Bum Hill in Myanmars Kachin State. The ancient beetle was so unique that the researchers created a new family, Cretophengodidae, for it. The unique combination of characters in\u00a0Cretophengodes azari is unknown in any currently defined beetle lineage, they said. Therefore,\u00a0Cretophengodes azari deserves family status in Elateroidea. Cretophengodes azari also represents a transitional fossil linking soft  and hard bodied elateroid beetles. The newly discovered fossil, preserved with life like fidelity in amber, represents an extinct relative of the fireflies and the living families Rhagophthalmidae and Phengodidae, said Dr. Yan Da Li, a researcher at Peking University and the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology and the Centre for Excellence in Life and Palaeoenvironment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. We think that light production initially evolved in the beetles soft and vulnerable larvae as a defensive mechanism to ward off predators. The fossil shows that by the Cretaceous period, light production was taken up by the adults as well, said Dr. Robin Kundrata, a researcher in the Department of Zoology at Palack\u00fd University. It could have than been co opted to serve other functions such as locating mates. The findings were published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

The archosauriform footprints were spotted at a paleontological site on the Gardetta Plateau in the Western Alps, Italy. Most of the specimens are preserved as natural molds on top of a 3 4 cm thick bed of fine sandstone. They are shallow, less than 2 cm deep, but most are cut by small scale cracksfissures and strongly weathered. The tracks are preserved on two distinct surfaces, labeled GT 1 and GT 2. GT 1 consists of four clear and two weakly impressed imprints, arranged in a 2.1 m long trackway in the lower part of the outcrop, just 2 m above the creek level. Its direction on the steep bedding plane points upwards to southeast, said Dr. Marco Romano from the Department of Earth Sciences at the Sapienza University of Rome and colleagues. GT 2 is 2.4 m long, is preserved in the lower part of the same bedding plane, about 2 m above the creek level.  The paleontologists assigned the tracks to the new ichnospecies, Isochirotherium gardettensis, and interpreted them as produced by a large bodied, predatory archosauriform, probably erythrosuchid, trackmaker. They were made approximately 250 million years ago Early Triassic epoch, soon after the Permian Triassic mass extinction event. This new discovery provides further evidence for the presence of archosauriformes at low latitudes during the Early Triassic epoch, the researchers said. It supports a model in which the Permian Triassic mass extinction did not completely vacate low latitude lands from tetrapods that therefore would have been able to cope with the extreme hot temperatures of Pangaea mainland.

Hybodontiform sharks are the closest relatives of modern sharks and rays, said University of Viennas Dr. Sebastian Stumpf and colleagues. They first appeared in the latest Devonian, about 361 million years ago, survived two of the big five Phanerozoic mass extinction events, and finally became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous, about 66 million years ago. These sharks had two dorsal fins, each supported by a prominent fin spine. Their body size ranged from a few centimeters to approximately 3 m 10 feet in maximum length, which consequently makes Asteracanthus one of the largest representatives of both its group and its time. In contrast, modern sharks and rays, which were already diverse during the Jurassic, only reached a body size of up to 2 m 6.6 feet in maximum length in very rare cases. In the new research, the paleontologists examined a new, exceptionally well preserved skeleton of Asteracanthus ornatissimus with dentition and fin spines from the Solnhofen limestones. Asteracanthus was scientifically described more than 180 years ago by the Swiss American naturalist Louis Agassiz on the basis of isolated fossil dorsal fin spines, they said. However, articulated skeletal remains have never been found  until now. According to the team, the dentition of Asteracanthus ornatissimus contained more than 150 teeth, each with a well developed central cusp that was accompanied on both sides by several smaller cusplets. This specialized type of dentition suggests that Asteracanthus was an active predator feeding on a wide range of prey animals, Dr. Stumpf said. Asteracanthus was certainly not only one of the largest cartilaginous fishes of its time, but also one of the most impressive. The findings were published in the journal Papers in Palaeontology. "}, {"title": " Dire Wolves Split from Living Canids 5.7 Million Years Ago: Study", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jan 15, 2021", "doc": "Dire wolves Canis dirus are considered to be one of the most common and widespread large carnivores in Pleistocene America, yet relatively little is known about their evolution or extinction. Previous analyses, based on morphology alone, had led scientists to believe that these long extinct canids were closely related to modern gray wolves Canis lupus. To reconstruct the evolutionary history of dire wolves, an international team of genetic researchers sequenced five genomes from the fossilized remains dating from 12,900 to more than 50,000 years ago. Their results, published in the journal Nature, indicate that dire wolves were a separate lineage that split from living canids around 5.7 million years ago. Dire wolves were large wolf like canids  around 68 kg, about 25 heavier than gray wolves  and among the most common extinct large carnivores of the American Late Pleistocene megafauna. Their remains are present in the North American paleontological record from at least around 250,000 to about 13,000 years ago, at the end of the Pleistocene epoch. Other canid species that were present in Late Pleistocene North America include the slightly smaller gray wolf, the much smaller coyote Canis latrans and the dhole Cuon alpinus, although dire wolves appear to have been more common overall. Dire wolves are generally described as a sister species, or even conspecific with, gray wolves. The leading hypothesis to explain their extinction was that, owing to their larger body size compared with gray wolves and coyotes, dire wolves were more specialized for hunting large prey and were unable to survive the extinction of their megafaunal prey. Dire wolves have always been an iconic representation of the last ice age in the Americas and now a pop culture icon thanks to Game of Thrones, but what we know about their evolutionary history has been limited to what we can see from the size and shape of their bones and teeth, said co lead author Dr. Angela Perri, a researcher in the Archaeology Department at Durham University. With this first ancient DNA analysis of dire wolves we have revealed that the history of dire wolves we thought we knew is actually much more complicated than we previously thought. Instead of being closely related to other North American canids, like gray wolves and coyotes, we found that dire wolves represent a branch that split off from others millions of years ago, representing the last of a now extinct lineage. The terrifying dire wolf, a legendary symbol of Los Angeles and the La Brea Tar Pits, has earned its place among the many large, unique species that went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene epoch, said co author Professor Robert Wayne, a researcher in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Los Angeles. Dire wolves are sometimes portrayed as mythical creatures  giant wolves prowling bleak frozen landscapes  but reality turns out to be even more interesting, said co lead author Dr. Kieren Mitchell, a researcher in the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the University of Adelaide. For the study, the researchers screened 46 sub fossil specimens of dire wolves for the presence of preserved DNA. They identified five samples from Idaho, Ohio, Tennessee and Wyoming, dating to between 12,900 and more than 50,000 years ago, that possessed sufficient DNA to obtain both mitochondrial and nuclear genome sequences. They found no evidence for the flow of genes between dire wolves and either North American gray wolves or coyotes. The absence of any genetic transference indicates that dire wolves evolved in isolation from the Ice Age ancestors of these other species. We have found the dire wolf is not closely related to the gray wolf, said co author Dr. Alice Mouton, a researcher in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Los Angeles. Further we show that the dire wolf never interbred with the gray wolf. In contrast, gray wolves, African wolves, dogs, coyotes and jackals can and do interbreed. Dire wolves likely diverged from gray wolves more than 5 million years ago, which was a great surprise that this divergence occurred so early. This finding highlights how special and unique the dire wolf was. The ancestors of gray wolves and much smaller coyotes evolved in Eurasia and are thought to have moved into North America less than 1.37 million years ago, relatively recently in evolutionary time. The dire wolf, on the other hand, based on its genetic difference from those species, is now believed to have originated in the Americas. The authors also suggest the dire wolves stark evolutionary divergence from gray wolves places them in an entirely different genus, Aenocyon, as first proposed by paleontologist John Campbell Merriam over 100 years ago. When we first started this study, we thought that dire wolves were just beefed up gray wolves, so we were surprised to learn how extremely genetically different they were, so much so that they likely could not have interbred, said senior author Professor Laurent Frantz, a researcher in the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences at Queen Mary University of London and the Department of Veterinary Sciences at Ludwig Maximilian University. This must mean that dire wolves were isolated in North America for a very long time to become so genetically distinct.

Two species of New World vultures family Cathartidae form part of the modern avifauna of Cuba the common turkey vulture Cathartes aura and the black vulture Coragyps atratus, which is very rare, Cuban ornithologist William Suarez and Dr. Storrs Olson from the Smithsonian Institutions National Museum of Natural History wrote in their paper. Vultures were better represented in Cubas fossil record during the Late Pleistocene and part of the Holocene and included the Cuban condor Gymnogyps varonai. The newly discovered species belongs to Cathartes, a genus of medium sized to large carrion feeding birds in the Cathartidae family. Named the Emslies vulture Cathartes emsliei, it lived during the Late Pleistocene to Holocene epoch, until as recently as 5,000 years ago. The species is named for our esteemed colleague and friend, Dr. Steven D. Emsli from the University of North Carolina Wilmington, in recognition of his contribution to the knowledge of New World vultures, including those from Cuba, the researchers explained. The fossilized bones of the Emslies vulture were recovered from Quaternary asphalt deposits at the site of Las Breas de San Felipe and cave deposits in Cueva de Sandoval and Cueva del Indio in western Cuba. Some specimens of the ancient bird are the smallest known in the genus Cathartes. Cuban scavengers were highly specialised, evolving in the complete absence of carnivorous mammals, and becoming extinct during the Holocene, the scientists wrote. The Emslies vulture appears to be derived from a Central American ancestor  probably one related to the smaller living species, the lesser yellow headed vulture Cathartes burrovianus  rather than from North America, unlike the two other extinct Cuban taxa in the genera Coragyps and Gymnogyps. Skulls with massive and large bills, compared to continental congeners, are common adaptations in Cuban carrion eaters.

Humans feeding leftover lean meat to wolves during harsh winters may have had a role in the early domestication of dogs. Illustration by John James Audubon  John Bachman. Humans are not fully adapted to a carnivorous diet. Human consumption of meat is limited by the livers capacity to metabolize protein, said Dr. Maria Lahtinen from the Finnish Museum of Natural History at the University of Helsinki and the Finnish Food Authority and hert colleagues. Contrary to humans, wolves can thrive on lean meat for months. We suggest that the differences between dietary constraints of wolves and humans enabled dog domestication in harsh environments in the Late Pleistocene. In the study, the researchers used energy content calculations to estimate how much energy would have been left over by humans from the meat of species horses, moose and deer they may have hunted 14,000 to 29,000 years that were also typical wolf prey species. They hypothesized that if wolves and humans had hunted the same animals during harsh winters, humans would have killed wolves to reduce competition rather than domesticate them. With the exception of weasel like animals, the scientists found that all prey species would have supplied more protein than humans could consume, resulting in excess lean meat that could be fed to wolves, thus reducing the competition for prey. Our calculations show that during harsh winters, when game is lean and devoid of fat, Late Pleistocene hunters gatherers in Eurasia would have a surplus of animal derived protein that could have been shared with incipient dogs, they said. Our partitioning theory explains how competition may have been ameliorated during the initial phase of dog domestication. Following this initial period, incipient dogs would have become docile, being utilized in a multitude of ways such as hunting companions, beasts of burden and guards as well as going through many similar evolutionary changes as humans. The research is described in a paper in the journal Scientific Reports.

Until recently, little was known about the origins of animals that evolved during the Cambrian explosion event because of a lack of well preserved fossil evidence. The mysterious origins of animals that evolved at this time baffled 19th century naturalist Charles Darwin. It is often referred to as Darwins dilemma. Prior to the new study, it had proven difficult to trace links with earlier animals because their soft tissues  which provide vital clues about the animals ancestry  almost always break down over time. During fieldwork in Namibia, University of Edinburghs Professor Rachel Wood and colleagues unearthed the well preserved fossilized remains of Namacalathus hermanastes. Using an X ray imaging technique, they found some of the animals soft tissues immaculately preserved inside the fossils by a metallic mineral called pyrite. Until now, paleontologists had only ever identified skeletal remains of Namacalathus hermanastes. Professor Wood and co authors then examined the soft tissues of the Ediacaran animal and compared them with those in animals that evolved later. They found that Namacalathus hermanastes was an early ancestor of species that appeared during the Cambrian explosion. Among them are types of prehistoric worms and mollusks. These are exceptional fossils, which give us a glimpse into the biological affinity of some of the oldest animals, Professor Wood said. They help us trace the roots of the Cambrian explosion and the origin of modern animal groups. Such preservation opens up many new avenues of research into the history of life which was previously not possible. The study was published in the journal Science Advances. "}, {"title": " Saber-Toothed Tigers Had Unique Growth Strategy among Big Cats", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Jan 8, 2021", "doc": "Paleontologists from the Royal Ontario Museum and the University of Toronto have found and examined the fossilized remains of two subadult and one adult saber toothed tigers Smilodon fatalis  likely a mother and two adolescents  in the Pleistocene coastal deposits in Ecuador. Their results show that saber toothed tigers had a unique growth strategy that combined a growth rate that is similar to a tiger and the extended growth period of a lion. Smilodon is a genus of extinct felids that lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch, between 2.5 million and 10,000 years ago. Commonly known as saber toothed tigers, it includes three recognized species Smilodon fatalis, S. gracilis, and S. populator. The saber toothed cat Smilodon occurred throughout North America and South America during the Pleistocene, said lead author Ashley Reynolds and colleagues. Of the three recognized species, Smilodon fatalis is the most completely known, with thousands of well preserved specimens in collections from so called tar pits. Without the necessary evidence to determine associations between individuals of Smilodon fatalis due to reworking and time averaging, inferences about social behavior are exceptionally difficult to infer from such predator trap deposits. Thus, smaller fossil assemblages of associated individuals preserved in fluviodeltaic depositional environments may be more useful for inferring aspects of life history and social behavior in these carnivores. We describe a multiple individual association of Smilodon fatalis preserved in a fluviodeltaic depositional setting in Ecuador, they added. Our analysis suggests that this assemblage is best interpreted as a part of a family group derived from a catastrophic mass mortality event, and thereby provides unique insights into the life history of this iconic predator. The fossilized partial jaws and skeletal elements from at least two subadult siblings and a single mature individual of Smilodon fatalis were found at the Coralito locality in Ecuador. Our study started out as a simple description of previously unpublished fossils, Reynolds said. But when we noticed the two lower jaws we were working on shared a type of tooth only found in about 5 of the Smilodon fatalis population, we knew the work was about to become much more interesting. Reynolds and co authors found that they were likely looking at three related individuals one adult and two young adolescents. They determined that the siblings were at least two years old, an age at which some living big cats, such as tigers, are already independent. The social lives of these iconic predators have been mysterious, in part because their concentration in tar seeps leaves so much room for interpretation, said Dr. Kevin Seymour, co author of the study. This historic assemblage of saber cat fossils from Ecuador was formed in a different way, allowing us to determine the two juveniles likely lived, and died, together  and were therefore probably siblings. A paper on the findings was published this week in the journal iScience.

Priacodon fruitaensis lived approximately 150 million years ago Jurassic period in what is now Colorado, the United States. The prehistoric animal was less than 20 cm 8 inches in length and had a mass between 41 and 61 g. Priacodon fruitaensis was first described in 1981 from a fossilized jaw found in rocks of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation. It belongs to Triconodontidae, an extinct family of early crown mammals with a fossil record from the Late Jurassic through the Late Cretaceous epoch. In new research, Dr. Kai J\u00e4ger and his colleagues from the Institute for Geosciences at the University of Bonn and Oklahomas Museum of Natural History examined the molar occlusion, jaw movement and morphology of Priacodon fruitaensis. Until now, it was unclear exactly how the teeth in the upper and lower jaws of Priacodon fruitaensis fit together. We have now been able to answer that question, said co author Professor Thomas Martin, a paleontologist in the Institute for Geosciences at the University of Bonn. The researchers used a special tomography method to produce high resolution 3D images of Priacodon fruitaensis molars. The upper and lower jaws each contain several molars, they said. In the predecessors of mammals, molar 1 of the upper jaw would bite down precisely on molar 1 of the lower jaw when chewing. In more developed mammals, however, the rows of teeth are shifted against each other. Molar 1 at the top therefore hits exactly between molar 1 and molar 2 when biting down, so that it comes into contact with two molars instead of one. We compared both options on the computer. This showed that the animal bit down like a modern mammal, Dr. J\u00e4ger said. Its dentition must have made it easy for Priacodon fruitaensis to cut the flesh of its prey. However, the animal was probably not a pure carnivore its molars have cone shaped elevations, similar to the peaks of a mountain. Such cusps are particularly useful for perforating and crushing insect carapaces. They are therefore also found in todays insectivores. However, the combination of carnivore and insectivore teeth is probably unique in this form. The cusps are also noticeable in other ways. They are practically the same size in all molars. This made the dentition extremely precise and efficient. However, these advantages came at a price small changes in the structure of the cusps would probably have dramatically worsened the chewing performance. This potentially made it more difficult for the dental apparatus to evolve, Dr. J\u00e4ger said. This type of dentition has in fact survived almost unchanged in certain lineages of evolutionary history over a period of 80 million years. At some point, however, its owners became extinct  perhaps because their teeth could not adapt to changing food conditions. The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The new fossil flower, named Valviloculus pleristaminis, belongs to the order Laurales, its closest affinities being with the families Monimiaceae and Atherospermataceae. This isnt quite a Christmas flower but it is a beauty, especially considering it was part of a forest that existed almost 100 million years ago, said lead author Professor George Poinar Jr., a paleontologist in the Department of Integrative Biology at Oregon State University. The male flower is tiny, about 2 mm across, but it has some 50 stamens arranged like a spiral, with anthers pointing toward the sky. A stamen consists of an anther pollen producing head and a filament stalk that connects the anther to the flower. Despite being so small, the detail still remaining is amazing. Our specimen was probably part of a cluster on the plant that contained many similar flowers, some possibly female. The specimen of\u00a0Valviloculus pleristaminis has an egg shaped, hollow floral cup part of the flower from which the stamens emanate an outer layer consisting of six petal like components known as tepals and two chamber anthers, with pollen sacs that split open via laterally hinged valves. It became encased in amber on the supercontinent of Gondwana and rafted on a continental plate some\u00a06,450 km 4,000 miles across the ocean from Australia to Southeast Asia. Geologists have been debating just when this chunk of land  known as the West Burma Block  broke away from Gondwana. Some scientists believe it was 200 million years ago others claim it was more like 500 million years ago. Since angiosperms only evolved and diversified about 100 million years ago, the West Burma Block could not have broken off from Gondwana before then, which is much later than dates that have been suggested by geologists, Professor Poinar said. The discovery is described in a paper in the Journal of the Botanical Research Institute of Texas.

Zh\u00f9r, which measures 41.7 cm 16.4 inches from snout to base of tail and weighs 670 g, is the most complete wolf mummy known. She was discovered in July 2016 in thawing permafrost in the Klondike goldfields, near Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. Her mummified carcass was recovered along a small tributary of Last Chance Creek during hydraulic thawing that exposed the permafrost sediment in which it was preserved. Zh\u00f9rs preservation was exceptional, from the papillae on her lips to her skin and fur. We think she was in her den and died instantaneously by den collapse, said lead author Dr. Julie Meachen, a researcher in the Department of Anatomy at Des Moines University. Our data showed that she didnt starve and was about 7 weeks old when she died, so we feel a bit better knowing the poor little girl didnt suffer for too long. By studying stable isotopes from Zh\u00f9rs hair and tooth samples, Dr. Meachen and colleagues were able to determine that her mother had a diet heavy in aquatic resources. That probably meant seasonal consumption of fish from the Klondike River, which still has a modern day spawning population of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. Normally when you think of wolves in the Ice Age, you think of them eating bison or musk oxen or other large animals on land, Dr. Meachen said. One thing that surprised us was that she was eating aquatic resources, particularly salmon. Through DNA testing of Zh\u00f9r and 29 other ancient and present day wolves, the scientists were also able to connect her genetics to ancient Beringian and Siberian gray wolves, as well as modern gray wolves. That includes individuals from both Eurasia and North America, highlighting the connections maintained between those continents as animals moved across the Bering Land Bridge. Weve been asked why she was the only wolf found in the den, and what happened to her mom or siblings, Dr. Meachen said. It could be that she was an only pup. Or the other wolves werent in the den during the collapse. Unfortunately, well never know. I feel a sense of privilege and gratitude for being able to work on a piece like this, said co author Dr. Matthew Wooller, director of the Alaska Stable Isotope Facility at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. A silver lining of climate change is that we may see more of them. The teams paper was published in the journal Current Biology.

Paludirex vincenti roamed Earth during the Pliocene epoch, between 5 and 2.5 million years ago. Nicknamed the swamp king, it grew up to 5 m 16.4 feet long and was capable of preying on giant prehistoric marsupials. Crocs have been an important component of Australias fauna for millions of years, said senior author Dr. Steve Salisbury, a paleontologist in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Queensland, Brisbane. But the two species we have today  Crocodylus porosus and Crocodylus johnstoni  are only recent arrivals, and were not part of the endemic croc fauna that existed here from about 55 million years ago. Whether Paludirex vincenti went extinct as a result of competition with species like Crocodylus porosus is hard to say. The alternative is that it went extinct as the climate dried, and the river systems it once inhabited contracted  were currently investigating both scenarios. Several fossilized specimens of Paludirex vincenti were discovered near the town of Chinchilla in south eastern Queensland. The largest crocodylian today is the Indo Pacific crocodile, Crocodylus porosus, which grows to about the same size, said lead author Jorgo Ristevski, a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Queensland, Brisbane. But Paludirex vincenti had a broader, more heavy set skull so it wouldve resembled an Indo Pacific crocodile on steroids. The study was published this week in the journal PeerJ.

The new dinosaur was an agile predator that lived between 233 and 225 million years ago the Carnian to the early Norian stage of the Triassic period. Dubbed Erythrovenator jacuiensis, the ancient creature was about 2 m long\u00a06.6 feet and had a mass of 9 kg. It belongs to Theropoda, a family of dinosaurs that includes Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor and modern day birds. It represents one of the earliest known theropod dinosaurs, probably similar in age to Lepidus praecisio and Camposaurus arizonensis, shedding lights on some of the earliest theropod features. The early evolution of theropod dinosaurs is poorly understood, said Dr. Rodrigo M\u00fcller, a paleontologist in the Centro de Apoio a Pesquisa Paleontologica da Quarta Colonia at the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria. Whereas sauropodomorphs are well known from the oldest dinosaur bearing outcrops, the record of theropods is fragmentary and ambiguous. The Triassic deposits from Brazil yielded some of the oldest dinosaurs worldwide. A portion of Erythrovenator jacuiensis left femur was discovered in 2017 at the Niemeyer site in municipality of Agudo in Rio Grande do Sul. Erythrovenator jacuiensis differs from all other known Triassic dinosaurs based on the absence of a raised dorsolateral trochanter of the femur local autapomorphy, Dr. M\u00fcller said. It represents the first carnivorous dinosaur from the assemblage dominated by the traversodontid cynodont Siriusgnathus, increasing our knowledge of the faunal content of this enigmatic assemblage. The discovery is described in a paper published online on November 27, 2020 in the Journal of South American Earth Sciences.

The newly identified python species lived in what is now Germany, approximately 47.6 million years ago Eocene period. Named Messelopython freyi, the ancient snake is the earliest known member of the superfamily Pythonoidea. The geographic origin of pythons is still not clear, said co author Dr. Krister Smith, a paleontologist in the Department of Messel Research and Mammalogy at the Senckenberg Research Institute and the Institute for Ecology, Diversity and Evolution at the Goethe University Frankfurt. According to our findings, these snakes already occurred in Europe at the time of the Eocene, over 47 million years ago, said lead author Dr. Hussam Zaher, a paleontologist in the Museu de Zoologia at the Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo. Our analyses trace their evolutionary history to Europe However, the large constrictor snakes subsequently disappeared from the European continent for quite some time, he noted. Fossils of this snake family did not appear again until the Miocene  between 23 and 5 million years ago. As the global climate began to cool again after the Miocene, the pythons once again disappeared from Europe, Dr. Smith added. The fossilized remains of several Messelopython freyi individuals were recovered from the Middle Messel Formation. The discovery of a new python species in the Messel Pit is a major leap forward in understanding these snakes evolutionary history, Dr. Smith said. Modern pythons live in complete spatial separation from their anatomically very similar relatives, the boas, he added. However, in Messel, Messelopython freyi and primitive boas such as Eoconstrictor fischeri lived together in the same ecosystem. We therefore have to revisit the thesis that these two groups of snakes competed with each other, making them unable to share the same habitats. The findings were published in the journal Biology Letters.

The newly discovered dinosaur species lived about 110 million years ago Aptian stage of the Cretaceous period in what is now Brazil. Named Ubirajara jubatus, the ancient animal was chicken sized with a mane of long fur down its back. It also had long, flat, stiff shoulder ribbons of keratin, each with a small sharp ridge running along the middle. Its arms were covered in fur like filaments down to the hands. What is especially unusual about the beast is the presence of two very long, probably stiff ribbons on either side of its shoulders that were probably used for display, for mate attraction, inter male rivalry or to frighten off foe, said co author Professor David Martill, a paleontologist in the School of the Environment, Geography and Geosciences at the University of Portsmouth. We cannot prove that the specimen is a male, but given the disparity between male and female birds, it appears likely the specimen was a male, and young, too, which is surprising given most complex display abilities are reserved for mature adult males. Given its flamboyance, we can imagine that the dinosaur may have indulged in elaborate dancing to show off its display structures. Ubirajara jubatus mane is thought to have been controlled by muscles allowing it to be raised, in a similar way a dog raises its hackles or a porcupine raises its spines when threatened. Any creature with movable hair or feathers as a body coverage has a great advantage in streamlining the body contour for faster hunts or escapes but also to capture or release heat, Professor Martill said. The elaborate plumage of Ubirajara jubatus might have improved its chances of survival, added lead author Robert Smyth, also from the School of the Environment, Geography and Geosciences at the University of Portsmouth. The fossilized partial skeleton of Ubirajara jubatus was collected from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Northeast Brazil. Ubirajara jubatus is the first non avian dinosaur to be described from Brazils Crato Formation, a shallow inland sea laid down about 110 million years ago, the paleontologists said. It is also the first non avian dinosaur found on the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana with preserved skin. Ubirajara jubatus is not only important because of the integumentary structures present for the first time in a non avian dinosaur, completely changing the way of seeing the behavior of certain dinosaurs, said co author Dr. Hector Rivera Sylva, a paleontologist at the Museo del Desierto, Mexico. Rather, the scientific value transcends, forming a watershed, since it is the first evidence for this group in Latin America, as well as one of the few reported for the subcontinent of Gondwana, expanding the knowledge about non avian feathered dinosaurs for America, whose evidence is very scarce. The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal Cretaceous Research.

Our analysis of Thecodontosaurus antiquus brain uncovered many fascinating features, some of which were quite surprising, said lead author Antonio Ballell Mayoral, a Ph.D. student in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol. Whereas its later relatives moved around ponderously on all fours, our findings suggest this species may have walked on two legs and been occasionally carnivorous. Using CT scanning, the researchers created detailed 3D models of Thecodontosaurus antiquus brain and identified previously unseen anatomical details. Even though the actual brain is long gone, the software allows us to recreate brain and inner ear shape via the dimensions of the cavities left behind, Ballell Mayoral said. The braincase of Thecodontosaurus antiquus is beautifully preserved so we compared it to other dinosaurs, identifying common features and some that are specific to Thecodontosaurus antiquus. Its brain cast even showed the detail of the floccular lobes, located at the back of the brain, which are important for balance. Their large size indicate it was bipedal. This structure is also associated with the control of balance and eye and neck movements, suggesting Thecodontosaurus antiquus was relatively agile and could keep a stable gaze while moving fast. The scientists were also able to reconstruct the inner ears of Thecodontosaurus antiquus, allowing them estimate how well it could hear compared to other dinosaurs. The dinosaurs hearing frequency was relatively high, pointing towards some sort of social complexity  an ability to recognize varied squeaks and honks from different animals. Our analysis showed parts of the brain associated with keeping the head stable and eyes and gaze steady during movement were well developed, Ballell Mayoral said. This could also mean Thecodontosaurus antiquus could occasionally catch prey, although its tooth morphology suggests plants were the main component of its diet. Its possible it adopted omnivorous habits. Its great to see how new technologies are allowing us to find out even more about how this little dinosaur lived more than 200 million years ago, said senior author Professor Mike Benton, a paleontologist in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol. The findings were published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. "}, {"title": " Land-Dwelling Dinosaur Relatives Bridge Gap to Origin of Pterosaurs", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Dec 14, 2020", "doc": "Pterosaurs were highly successful reptiles that lived between 210 and 65 million years ago. They were the first vertebrates to evolve powered flight, but their origin has remained an unresolved enigma in paleontology since the 19th century. With the help of pterosaur skulls and skeletons that were unearthed in North America, Brazil, Argentina, and Madagascar in recent years, a team of paleontologists has now demonstrated that flightless dinosaur precursors called lagerpetids family Lagerpetidae are the sister group of pterosaurs. Pterosaurs are deeply rooted in popular culture, are frequently portrayed in books and films, and include the largest flying animals ever known. Their evolutionary history spans more than 150 million years, ending at the close of the Mesozoic era. The oldest pterosaurs are from the Upper Triassic epoch 219 201.3 million years ago of Europe and North America and they diversified into several groups by the Middle Late Jurassic epochs. The oldest recognized pterosaurs already had a highly specialized body plan linked to their ability to fly, which was conserved in all pterosaus. The first pterosaurs were found during the 18th century and, from that time, it was observed that they had an anatomy, a body plan that was very different from that of other known reptiles, having wings formed by membranes, supported by an hyperdeveloped fourth finger of the hand the ring finger in humans, which is a unique feature of pterosaurs, said lead author Dr. Mart\u00edn Ezcurra, a paleontologist at the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales, CONICET and the University of Birmingham. Since then, and during the next 250 years, one of the main mysteries of vertebrate paleontology was who were the closest terrestrial relatives of these flying reptiles and thus be able to understand how this evolutionary transition occurred. The origin of the flying reptiles was one of the great enigmas of paleontology and evolutionary biology as a whole, said co author Dr. Federico Agnolin, a paleontologist at the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales, CONICET and the Universidad Maim\u00f3nides. Now, we know that there was an intermediate step in the lagerpetids, terrestrial reptiles that look similar to a lizard, which could not fly, but that, in this study, we could already observe some evolutionary steps in their brain and inner ears that were adaptations that later would have allowed pterosaurs to develop flight. The lagerpetids were small, wingless reptiles that lived across Pangea during much of the Triassic period, from 237 to 210 million years ago. In their research, Dr. Ezcurra, Dr. Agnolin and their colleagues used micro computed tomographic \u03bcCT scanning to examine fragile skull bones jaws, skull roofs and braincases and associated skeletal remains of lagerpetids. They determined that the lagerpetid brains and sensory systems had many similarities with those of pterosaurs. Some of these delicate fossils were collected nearly 80 years ago, and rather than destructively cutting into the first known skull of a lagerpetid species called Dromomeron gregorii, we were able to use this technology to carefully reconstruct the brain and inner ear anatomy of these small fossils to help determine the early relatives of pterosaurs, said co author Dr. Michelle Stocker, a researcher in the Department of Geosciences at Virginia Tech. One stark and mystifying finding was that the flightless lagerpetids had already evolved some of the neuroanatomical features that allowed the pterosaurs to fly, which brought forth even more information on the origin of flight. From the CT scans, we discovered that lagerpetids shared a number of unique characteristics with pterosaurs, which allowed them to have greater agility, Dr. Ezcurra said. One of these characteristics is that in the cerebellum of lagerpetids and pterosaurs, there is a structure called flocculum, highly developed in both, which is interpreted as an evolutionary adaptation that gave them a greater capacity for processing information. For example, between the eye, the rest of the head and the members of the body, so they could have greater visual coordination. Now that lagerpetids are deemed the precursors of pterosaurs, paleontologists can say that pterosaurs evolved at the same rate as other major reptile groups, thanks to the newly discovered middle man. Flight is such a fascinating behavior, and it evolved multiple times during Earths history, said co author Dr. Serjoscha Evers, a researcher in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Oxford and the Department of Geosciences at the University of Fribourg. Proposing a new hypothesis of their relationships with other extinct animals is a major step forward in understanding the origins of pterosaur flight. Some questions still remain in this evolutionary mystery. Now that lagerpetids are the closest relatives of pterosaurs, why are they still lacking some of the key characteristics of pterosaurs, including the most outstanding of those  wings? We are still missing lots of information about the earliest pterosaurs, and we still dont know how their skeletons transformed into an animal that was capable of flight, said co author Dr. Sterling Nesbitt, a researcher in the Department of Geosciences at Virginia Tech.

Iguanas are relatively large terrestrial lizards that are primarily native to Central America, South America, the Caribbean, and the Bahamas. They can grow up to 1.8 m 6 feet in length, including their tails. Despite their large size, formidable claws and fierce looking spikes arrayed on their backs, iguanas are mostly herbivores. The fossil record for iguanas goes back to the Late Cretaceous epoch in South America. Their skeletal remains are well represented in Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary rocks. However, their trace fossils, whether as tracks, burrows, coprolites, or additional sign, remain unreported. One of the cool things about iguanas is that they are survivors, said Professor Anthony Martin, a paleontologist in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Emory University. And one of the main ways that they survive is through burrowing. Digging burrows has helped them survive hurricanes, droughts and other bad things that might be in their environment, like most predators. But burrows are not as helpful when it comes to rats and pigs. During a stop on the shoreline road on the south end of San Salvador Island, Professor Martin and colleagues happened to notice an unusual trace fossil on the limestone outcrop. After further investigation, they determined that the fossil they found was that of a nesting iguana burrow. They also were able to date the fossil to about 115,000 years ago due to tell tale red paleosols. San Salvador is one of the outer most islands in the Bahamas chain and really isolated, Professor Martin said. Its a mystery how and when the modern day San Salvadoran rock iguanas arrived there. Today, they are among the rarest lizards in the world, with only a few hundred of them left. The San Salvador rock iguana Cyclura riyeli riyeli, a terrestrial and burrow nesting subspecies of rock iguana, lives on modern day San Salvador. This and other rock iguanas were plentiful throughout the Bahamas before 1492, when European ships began introducing rats, pigs and other invasive species that feed on the lizards eggs. The oldest iguana skeletons found on San Salvador only date back less than 12,000 years Holocene epoch, so the discovery of the iguana trace burrow pushes their presence on the islands back significantly.

"}, {"title": " Non-Marine Mass Extinctions Occur with Periodicity of 27.5 Million Years: Study", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Dec 11, 2020", "doc": "Non marine animals amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals have apparently experienced at least 10 distinct episodes of intensified extinctions over the past 300 million years. Eight of these extinction events are concurrent with known marine mass extinctions, which previously yielded evidence for an underlying period of 26.4 to 27.3 million years ago. In new research, a team of scientists from New York University and Carnegie Institution for Science performed an analysis of the ten recognized non marine mass extinctions and detected a statistically significant underlying periodicity of 27.5 million years they also found that these mass extinctions align with major asteroid impacts and devastating volcanic outpourings of lava called flood basalt eruptions. It seems that large body impacts and the pulses of internal Earth activity that create flood basalt volcanism may be marching to the same 27 million year drumbeat as the extinctions, perhaps paced by our orbit in the Milky Way Galaxy, said lead author Professor Michael Rampino, a researcher in the Department of Biology at New York University. About 66 million years ago, 70 of all species on land and in the seas, including the non avian dinosaurs, suddenly went extinct, in the disastrous aftermath of the collision of a large asteroid or comet with the Earth. Subsequently, paleontologists discovered that such mass extinctions of marine life, in which up to 90 of species disappeared, were not random events, but seemed to come in a 26.4 27.3  million year cycle. In their new study, Professor Rampino and colleagues examined the record of mass extinctions of land dwelling animals and concluded that they coincided with the extinctions of ocean life. They also performed new statistical analyses of the extinctions of land species and demonstrated that those events followed a similar cycle of about 27.5 million years. What could be causing the periodic mass extinctions on land and in the seas? Mass extinctions are not the only events occurring in cycles the ages of impact craters  created by asteroids and comets crashing to the Earths surface  also follow a cycle aligning with the extinction cycle. Astrophysicists hypothesize that periodic comet showers occur in the Solar System every 26 to 30 million years, producing cyclical impacts and resulting in periodic mass extinctions. The Sun and planets cycle through the crowded mid plane of the Milky Way about every 30 million years. During those times, comet showers are possible, leading to large impacts on the Earth. The impacts can create conditions that would stress and potentially kill off land and marine life, including widespread dark and cold, wildfires, acid rain, and ozone depletion. These new findings of coinciding, sudden mass extinctions on land and in the oceans, and of the common 26  to 27 million year cycle, lend credence to the idea of periodic global catastrophic events as the triggers for the extinctions, Professor Rampino said. In fact, three of the mass annihilations of species on land and in the sea are already known to have occurred at the same times as the three largest impacts of the last 250 million years, each capable of causing a global disaster and resulting mass extinctions. The scientists were surprised to find another possible explanation beyond asteroids for mass extinctions flood basalt eruptions, or giant volcanic eruptions that cover vast areas with lava. All eight of the coinciding mass extinctions of land dwelling and marine animals matched times of flood basalt eruptions. These eruptions also would have created severe conditions for life, including brief periods of intense cold, acid rain, and ozone destruction and increased radiation longer term, eruptions could lead to lethal greenhouse heating and more acid and less oxygen in the ocean. The global mass extinctions were apparently caused by the largest cataclysmic impacts and massive volcanism, perhaps sometimes working in concert, Professor Rampino said. The research is published in the Historical Biology, an International Journal of Paleobiology.

Ichthyosaurs were a successful group of large marine reptiles for most of the Mesozoic Era. They first appeared in the Early Triassic epoch, 248 million years ago, and became extinct in the early Late Cretaceous, 90 million years ago. By the Jurassic period, they had evolved into highly adapted marine predators, with a streamlined body for moving through the water, large eyes for improved vision at depth and an elongated skull with jaws full of conical teeth, suited for catching fish and squid. The newly identified ichthyosaur, named Thalassodraco etchesi, lived approximately 150 million years ago Late Jurassic epoch. The aquatic reptile was about 2 m 6.6 feet long, and had a deep ribcage, small forelimbs and hundreds of tiny, delicate, smooth teeth. It belongs to Ophthalmosauridae, an extinct family of ichthyosaurs known from the Middle Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous of Asia, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. There are a number of things that make this animal special, not least of which is its unusual rib cage and small flippers, said co author Professor David Martill, a paleontologist in the School of the Environment, Geography and Geosciences at the University of Portsmouth. It may have swum with a distinctive style from other ichthyosaurs. One idea is that it could be a deep diving species, like sperm whales, added lead author Megan Jacobs, a doctoral candidate in the Department of Geosciences at Baylor University. The extremely deep rib cage may have allowed for larger lungs for holding their breath for extended periods, or it may mean that the internal organs werent crushed under the pressure. It also has incredibly large eyes, which means it could see well in low light. That could mean it was diving deep down, where there was no light, or it may have been nocturnal. With the deep rib cage, the creature would have looked very barrel like. The specimens hundreds of tiny teeth would have been suited for a diet of squid and small fish, and the teeth are unique by being completely smooth. All other ichthyosaurs have larger teeth with prominent striated ridges on them, so we knew pretty much straight away this animal was different. The fossilized remains of Thalassodraco etchesi  a near complete skull with associated vertebral column, dorsal ribs, left forelimb and other elements  were collected in 2009 by fossil collector Dr. Steve Etches from the White Stone Band outcropping in Rope Lake Bay, Dorset. Skeletons of Late Jurassic ichthyosaurs in the UK are extremely rare, so, after doing some research, comparing it with those known from other Late Jurassic deposits around the world, and not being able to find a match was very exciting, Jacobs said. Thalassodraco etchesi is a beautifully preserved ichthyosaur, with soft tissue preservation making it all the more interesting. The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal PLoS ONE.

This remarkable sixth sense is known as remote touch, and the associated organ is found in probe foraging species belonging to both the palaeognathous in kiwi and neognathous in ibises and shorebirds groups of modern birds. Intriguingly, a structurally similar bill tip organ is also present in the beaks of living, non probing palaeognathous birds e.g. emu and ostriches that do not use remote touch. A team of researchers from South Africa provides evidence that the lithornithids  the earliest known palaeognathous birds which evolved in the Cretaceous period  had the ability to use remote touch. Whats been really exciting to paleobiologists studying the evolution of birds, aside from remote touch being a remarkable sensory adaptation that has cropped up multiple times in the avian record, is that this bill tip organ has the potential to be preserved in the fossil record, as it appears to potentially be characterized by large numbers of bony pits on the surfaces of the beak bones, said lead author Carla du Toit, a Ph.D. candidate in the FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology at the University of Cape Town. Toit and her colleagues hypothesized that the bill tip organs found in all living paleognaths might be a vestigial organ remaining from their most recent common ancestor. Luckily, exquisitely preserved beaks of the lithornithids have been found in North America and Europe, they said. These small birds with relatively long beaks and legs are believed to have co existed with dinosaurs in the Cretaceous period before the extinction event that killed off all non avian dinosaurs. Our study shows that some if not all the wetland dwelling lithornithids were likely able to use remote touch to locate buried prey, in much the same way that modern day ibises and kiwi do. The findings suggest that modern paleognaths retained the structural components of the ancestral bill tip organ even though it became functionally redundant, much like the hind limb bones of whales or pythons. Weve been puzzled by the bill tip organs of ostriches and emus, ever since they were first described by South African researchers about five years ago, said senior author Dr. Susan Cunningham, also from the FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology at the University of Cape Town. We knew what this kind of beak was for in probe foraging birds like kiwis, which are also paleognaths, but it didnt make sense that these structures were present in their giant non probing relatives as well, especially as ostrich and emu brains are not wired to deal with the kind of tactile information a bill tip organ provides. Discovering that the earliest known paleognaths  the lithornithids  were thought to be probe foraging wetland birds, and that there were beautifully preserved fossils available, was really a light bulb moment for us. The results suggest that remote touch evolved very early in modern birds, perhaps from snout tactile specializations of their non avian dinosaur ancestors. This is such an incredibly cool study, said co author Professor Anusuya Chinsamy Turan, also from the FitzPatrick Institute of African Ornithology at the University of Cape Town. Weve been able to show that the Mesozoic ancestor of ratites such as, ostriches, rhea, and emu was a probe feeding bird like modern ibises and kiwi. Furthermore, our finding suggests that the remote sense organ in the beaks of birds most likely originated from the sensitive snouts of their dinosaurian ancestors.

The new cynodont species lived approximately 218 million years ago Late Triassic epoch. The animal, scientifically named Agudotherium gassenae, was a type of non mammaliaform probainognathian. Probainognathia is a group of cynodonts that originated during the early Middle Triassic and includes the crown group, Mammalia, Dr. Micheli Stefanello of the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria and her colleagues wrote in their paper. The non mammaliaform probainognathians have a rich fossil record, and are abundant and diverse in the Triassic fauna from the supercontinent Gondwana. The South American record, so far known only from Brazil and Argentina, consists of about 20 species from Middle and Upper Triassic strata, most of them based upon relatively well preserved specimens. The diversity and morphological disparity of Middle Late Triassic South American probainognathian cynodonts are remarkable, they added. They form the primary basis for understanding the evolutionary transformations underlying the origin of the Mammaliaformes, a group including mammals and their closest extinct relatives. The paleontologists examined two specimens of Agudotherium gassenae a left lower jaw with the canine and postcanine teeth and a right lower jaw with incisors, canine and postcanines. The fossils were collected at the Niemeyer Site in the municipality of Agudo in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. Agudotherium gassenae is based on a unique combination of features not present in other cynodonts, such as a robust dentary, with the dorsoventrally deep dentary body and a rectilinear ventral margin, the researchers wrote. Agudotherium gassenae was about 30 cm 11.8 inches long and most likely had a carnivorousinsectivorous diet, consuming small invertebrates such as insects, worms, and small vertebrates. The new species contributes to our knowledge of the evolutionary radiation of small prozostrodonts that occurred in western Gondwana during the Late Triassic and led to the emergence of several important cynodont groups, including Mammaliaformes, the scientists concluded. A paper describing the discovery was published in October 2020 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. "}, {"title": " Cambrian Deep-Sea Arthropods Had Complex Compound Eyes", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Dec 4, 2020", "doc": "A team of paleontologists from Australia and the United Kingdom has found that ancient deep sea creatures called radiodonts developed sophisticated eyes over 500 million years ago Cambrian period, with some specially adapted to the dim light of deep water. Radiodonts meaning radiating teeth are a group of arthropods that dominated the oceans around 500 million years ago. The many radiodont species share a similar body layout comprising of a head with a pair of large, segmented appendages for capturing prey, a circular mouth with serrated teeth, and a squid like body. It now seems likely that some lived at depths down to 1,000 m 3,281 feet and had developed large, complex eyes to compensate for the lack of light in this extreme environment. When complex visual systems arose, animals could better sense their surroundings, that may have fuelled an evolutionary arms race between predators and prey, said lead author Professor John Paterson, a researcher in the Palaeoscience Research Centre at the University of New England. Once established, vision became a driving force in evolution and helped shape the biodiversity and ecological interactions we see today. In 2011, Professor Paterson and colleagues documented isolated eye specimens of up to 1 cm 0.4 inches in diameter from the 515 million year old Emu Bay Shale on Kangaroo Island, but they were unable to assign them to a known arthropod species. They also described the stalked eyes of Anomalocaris, a top predator up to 1 m 3.3 feet in length, in great detail. The Emu Bay Shale is the only place in the world that preserves eyes with lenses of Cambrian radiodonts, said Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Bellido, a researcher in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Adelaide and South Australian Museum. The more than thirty specimens of eyes we now have, has shed new light on the ecology, behavior and evolution of these, the largest animals alive 500 million years ago. In the new study, the researchers identified the owner of 515 million year old eye specimens Anomalocaris briggsi, representing a new genus that is yet to be formally named. We discovered much larger specimens of these eyes of up to 4 cm 1.6 inches in diameter that possess a distinctive acute zone, which is a region of enlarged lenses in the center of the eyes surface that enhances light capture and resolution, Professor Paterson said. The large lenses of Anomalocaris briggsi suggest that it could see in very dim light at depth, similar to amphipod crustaceans, a type of prawn like creature that exists today. The frilly spines on its appendages filtered plankton that it detected by looking upwards. These specimens have shown us that the animals feeding strategies previously indicated by the appendages  either for capturing or filtering prey  are paralleled by differences in the eyes, said Dr. Greg Edgecombe, a paleontologist in the Department of Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museum, London. The predatory radiodont in our samples has the eyes attached to the head on stalks but one that filter feeds has them at the surface of the head. The more we learn about these animals the more diverse their body plan and ecology is turning out to be. The new samples also show how the eyes changed as the animal grew. The lenses formed at the margin of the eyes, growing bigger and increasing in numbers in large specimens  just as in many living arthropods. The way compound eyes grow has been consistent for more than 500 million years. The scientists also found that the Anomalocaris eyes described in 2011 are likely from a species called Anomalocaris aff. canadensis. The Australian material is unique among the dozens of occurrences of radiodonts around the world in the Cambrian period, because its the only place where the visual surface of the eye is preserved, Dr. Edgecombe said. In other sites in China, Canada, the United States and elsewhere, only the outline of the eyes is known but theres no information on their lenses. The study was published in the journal Sciences Advances.

The occurrence of osteomyelitis in dinosaurs is rare, but recent studies have corroborated the occurrence of this form of bone inflammation in Sauropodomorpha, said lead author Dr. Tito Aureliano and his colleagues from the University of Campinas, the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, and the Federal University of Sao Carlos. Evidence of fossil endoparasites of vertebrates has already been found in coprolites and invertebrate vectors preserved in amber. However, fossil parasites preserved directly in vertebrate tissues were unknown until the present date. In the study, the researchers looked at the 85.2 million year old fragmentary fibula of a titanosaur from Brazils Adamantina Formation. They used CT scanning to create a 3D model of the full fossil. They also examined the specimen with petrographic and non filtered optical microscopes. They identified tens of fossil parasites preserved inside the specimens vascular canals  the first clear example of a parasite preserved inside fossilized bone tissue. The dinosaur fibula also showed acute osteomyelitis with elliptical ulcerations, present throughout all the bone. Bone inflammation was either caused by the referred parasites or facilitated its infestation. Our research documents for the first time the detailed histological description of severe bone inflammation and the exceptional preservation of soft bodied parasitical microorganisms inside the vascular canals of a non avian dinosaur, the scientists said. The results bring new insights into the fields of parasitology, pathology, and histology in the fossil record. The teams paper was published in the journal Cretaceous Research. "}, {"title": " Newly-Discovered Long-Necked Dinosaur Survived Early Jurassic Global Warming", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Nov 30, 2020", "doc": "Paleontologists in Argentina have identified a new species of eusauropod true sauropod dinosaur that lived 179 million years ago, just after the mysterious disappearance of non eusauropod sauropodomorphs. The newly identified dinosaur lived in what is now Patagonia, Argentina during the Early Jurassic epoch. The ancient creature was a type of eusauropod, a group of long necked, strictly herbivorous, quadrupedal dinosaurs that thrived from the Early Jurassic through the Late Cretaceous. Named Bagualia alba, the animal is in fact the oldest eusauropod dinosaur known to date. Sauropodomorpha is the first major dinosaurian group that diversified into multiple herbivorous lineages recorded throughout the world, said Dr. Diego Pol from the Museo Paleontol\u00f3gico Egidio Feruglio and CONICET and his colleagues from Argentina, the United States and Germany. The first 40 million years of sauropodomorph evolution are characterized by the coexistence of diverse lineages with great disparity in body size, feeding biomechanics and locomotion types, ranging from small less than 10 kg bipedal species to the large greater than 5 tons quadrupedal early sauropods. By the Middle Jurassic, eusauropod dinosaurs were the only surviving sauropodomorph lineage. The remains of at least three individuals of Bagualia alba  including a partial skull and cervical vertebrae  were found at the same site in Bagual Canyon in the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Asfalto Basin, central Patagonia. Sauropods became the dominant group of large herbivores in terrestrial ecosystems after multiple related lineages became extinct towards the end of the Early Jurassic, the paleontologists explained. The causes and precise timing of this key faunal change, as well as the origin of eusauropods, have remained ambiguous mainly due to the scarce dinosaurian fossil record of this time. The terrestrial sedimentary successions of the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Asfalto Basin document this critical interval of dinosaur evolution. To shed light on the extinction of sauropodomorphs, Dr. Pol and co authors examined fossil flora and fauna of the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Asfalto Basin. They found evidence for severe perturbations to the ancient climate and a drastic decrease in the floral diversity, characterized by the rise of conifers with small scaly leaves, after a massive magmatic event that impacted southern Gondwana between 180 and 184 million years ago. They believe that the non eusauropod sauropodomorphs went extinct after soft vegetation was replaced by much tougher greenhouse vegetation. Bagualia alba and other eusauropods recorded after the event invariably display characters that may have been critical for their success after this environmental change, the researchers said. Their elongated neck provided maximal feeding envelopes and browsing heights and their large body size has been related to an expansion of gut capacity and fiber digestibility. Their deep and robust skulls and mandibles indicate high bite force and their long jaw gape and large and broad teeth with thick enamel greater than 700 \u00b5m and extensive shearing wear facets have been interpreted as adaptations to obligate high fiber herbivory and bulk feeding on tough, fibrous plant material.

"}, {"title": " Cretaceous-Period Bird from Madagascar Had Sickle-Shaped Beak", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Nov 27, 2020", "doc": "Paleontologists in Madagascar have identified a new genus and species of enantiornithine bird that had a long and deep beak, a morphology that was previously unknown among Mesozoic birds. The newly identified bird species lived between 70 and 68 million years ago Late Cretaceous epoch in what is now Madagascar. Named Falcatakely forsterae, it belongs to Enantiornithines, an extinct group of birds known exclusively from the Cretaceous and predominantly from fossils discovered in Asia. Enantiornithines represent the first great diversification of early birds, occupying ecosystems alongside their non avian relatives such as Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus, said Dr. Alan Turner, a researcher in the Department of Anatomical Sciences at Stony Brook University. Unlike the first birds, such as Archaeopteryx, with long tails and primitive features in the skull, enantiornithines like Falcatakely forsterae would have looked relatively modern. Falcatakely forsterae was small, about the size of a crow, and had a sickle shaped beak. We dont really know why certain beak shapes evolve, but we do know they are used for a multitude of functions such as object manipulation, feather grooming, feeding, and other life sustaining behaviors, Dr. Turner said. In the case of Falcatakely forsterae, that was probably the same and it is significant to discover that this early bird during the Cretaceous had such a uniquely evolved beak. Falcatakely forsterae is known from a well preserved partial skull found in northwestern Madagascar. The exquisite quality of preservation is outstanding and reveals many important details, the paleontologists said. As one example, a complex series of grooves on the external surface of bones making up the side of the face indicate that the animal hosted an expansive keratinous covering, or beak, in life. Using high resolution micro computed tomography and digital modeling, they virtually dissected individual bones from the rock. It was quickly apparent that bones making up the face in Falcatakely forsterae are organized quite unlike those of any dinosaur, avian or non avian, despite having a face superficially similar to a number of modern bird groups alive today, they said. All living birds build the skeleton of their beaks in a very specific way. Its mostly formed by a single enlarged bone call the premaxilla. In constrast, most birds from the age of dinosaurs, like the iconic Archaeopteryx, have relatively unspecialized snouts comprised of a small premaxilla and a large maxilla. Surprisingly, in Falcatakely forsterae we found this similar primitive arrangement of bones but with an overall face shape reminiscent of certain modern birds with a high, long upper bill and completely unlike anything known in the Mesozoic.  It turns out you can make a modern looking beak in multiple ways, Dr. Turner said. The developmental basis for the skeleton of modern beaks didnt need to be there for a modern looking beak to evolve. The discovery is described in a paper in the journal Nature. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Find First Dinosaur Remains in Ireland", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Nov 24, 2020", "doc": "Paleontologists have found the fossilized remains of two Jurassic dinosaur species in Co. Antrim in Northern Ireland. These are the first dinosaur remains reported from anywhere in Ireland and some of the most westerly in Europe. This is a hugely significant discovery, said Dr. Mike Simms, a curator and paleontologist in the Department of Natural Sciences at National Museums Northern Ireland. The great rarity of such fossils here is because most of Irelands rocks are the wrong age for dinosaurs, either too old or too young, making it nearly impossible to confirm dinosaurs existed on these shores. The two fossil bones were found by the late Roger Byrne, a schoolteacher and fossil collector, who donated them along with many other fossils to Ulster Museum. The fossils that Roger Byrne found were perhaps swept out to sea, alive or dead, sinking to the Jurassic seabed where they were buried and fossilized, Dr. Simms said. Originally it was assumed the fossils were from the same animal, but Dr. Simms and colleagues were surprised to discover that they were from two completely different dinosaurs. One is part of a femur upper leg bone of a four legged plant eater called Scelidosaurus. The other is part of the tibia lower leg bone of a two legged meat eater similar to Sarcosaurus. Analyzing the shape and internal structure of the bones, we realized that they belonged to two very different animals, said Dr. Robert Smyth, a paleontologist in the School of the Environment, Geography and Geological Sciences at the University of Portsmouth. One is very dense and robust, typical of an armored plant eater. The other is slender, with thin bone walls and characteristics found only in fast moving two legged predatory dinosaurs called theropods. Despite being fragmentary, these fossils provide valuable insight on a very important period in dinosaur evolution, about 200 million years ago, he added. Its at this time that dinosaurs really start to dominate the worlds terrestrial ecosystems. Scelidosaurus keeps on turning up in marine strata, and I am beginning to think that it may have been a coastal animal, perhaps even eating seaweed like marine iguanas do today, said Professor David Martill, also from the School of the Environment, Geography and Geological Sciences at the University of Portsmouth. The findings were published in the Proceedings of the Geologists Association. "}, {"title": " New Carnivorous Dinosaur Unearthed in Patagonia", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Nov 23, 2020", "doc": "A new genus and species of medium sized abelisaurid dinosaur has been unearthed in northern Patagonia, Argentina. Scientifically named Niebla antiqua, the new dinosaur species lived approximately 69 million years ago, during the Late Cretaceous epoch. The ancient predator belongs to Abelisauridae, a family of ceratosaurian theropod dinosaurs known exclusively from the ancient supercontinent Gondwana. Abelisaurids first appeared during the middle Jurassic period and survived until the end of the Mesozoic era. Niebla antiqua is relatively small, much smaller than other abelisaurids such as Carnotaurus and Abelisaurus, said Mauro Aranciaga Rolando from the Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas CONICET and colleagues. The fossilized remains of Niebla antiqua were found at the Arriagada Farm near the Matadero Hill, about 70 km south from General Roca city in R\u00edo Negro province. The type specimen of Niebla antiqua comes from the top of the Allen Formation, Late Cretaceous of the Neuqu\u00e9n Group, the paleontologists said. It is represented by two incomplete dorsal centra, weathered dorsal ribs, a scapulocoracoid and fragmentary skull bones including a nearly complete braincase and the tip of the right dentary. The analysis of the fossils revealed that Niebla antiqua had a highly derived braincase and pectoral shoulder girdle. The holotype specimen of\u00a0Niebla antiqua represents a somatically mature individual, the researchers said. The count of the lines of arrested growth suggests a minimum age of 9 years increases the histological evidence for these theropods. The presence of a small to middle medium sized abelisaurid in the Upper Cretaceous shows that there is a higher diversity of derived abelisaurids in Patagonia that previously thought, they concluded. The discovery is reported in a paper in the Journal of South American Earth Sciences.

The newly identified shark, Ferromirum oukherbouchi, swam in Earths oceans some 365 million years ago Devonian period. It had a slender body measuring about 33\u2009cm 13 inches in length, very large eyes and specialized jaws. The excellently preserved fossil weve examined is a unique specimen, said senior author Dr. Christian Klug, a paleontologist in the Pal\u00e4ontologisches Institut und Museum at the University of Zurich. Dr. Klug and his colleagues from Switzerland, the United States and the Netherlands investigated the morphology and biomechanics of the superbly preserved jaws of Ferromirum oukherbouchi. What we discovered in the process was that unlike in humans, the two sides of the lower jaw were not fused in the middle, they said. This enabled the animals to not only drop the jaw halves downward but at the same automatically rotate both outwards. Through this rotation, the younger, larger and sharper teeth, which usually pointed toward the inside of the mouth, were brought into an upright position, added first author Dr. Linda Frey, also from the Pal\u00e4ontologisches Institut und Museum at the University of Zurich. This made it easier for animals to impale their prey. Through an inward rotation, the teeth then pushed the prey deeper into the buccal space when the jaws closed. This mechanism not only made sure the larger, inward facing teeth were used, but also enabled Ferromirum oukherbouchi to engage in what is known as suction feeding. In combination with the outward movement, the opening of the jaws causes sea water to rush into the oral cavity, while closing them results in a mechanical pull that entraps and immobilizes the prey, the researchers said. We believe that the described type of jaw joint played an important role in the Paleozoic era. With increasingly frequent tooth replacement, however, it became obsolete over time and was replaced by the often peculiar and more complex jaws of modern day sharks and rays. The discovery of Ferromirum oukherbouchi was reported in a paper in the journal Communications Biology.

Most of the major mass extinctions of the last 300 million years, as well as some of the lesser biotic turnover events, are associated with reorganizations or perturbations of the Earths natural carbon cycle. The end Triassic mass extinction began after a volcanic eruption spewed carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, disrupting the carbon cycle and sparking a chain reaction of environmental events. That carbon disruption led to acidic ocean waters which then affected delicate marine ecosystems, and led to other unfavorable planetary changes. The extinction event resulted in the demise of some 76 of all marine and land species. In a new study, a research team led by Curtin University scientists analyzed biomarkers molecular fossils extracted from rocks collected in the United Kingdoms Bristol Channel and found evidence of ancient microbial mats, which are complex communities of microorganisms. Through our analysis of the chemical signature of these microbial mats, in addition to seeing sea level change and water column freshening, we discovered the end Triassic mass extinction occurred later than previously thought, said first author Calum Peter Fox, a Ph.D. student in the Western Australia Organic  Isotope Geochemistry Centre at Curtin University and the Department of Earth Sciences at Khalifa University of Science and Technology. Previous research suggests the extinction took place where we now know microbial mats flourished and the chemical signatures left by these ancient microbes complicated the rock record, leading others to believe this is where the extinction took place. The microbial mats recorded in UK samples are comparable to extant microbial mats such as in Shark Bay of Western Australia, he said. Its amazing to consider that similar microbial communities that confounded the timing of one of Earths largest extinctions millions of years ago are on our shorelines and so easy to observe for ourselves. The findings not only presented a new theory of what started the end Triassic extinction, but also provided a type of warning for future potential mass extinction events on Earth, said senior author Professor Kliti Grice, also from the Western Australia Organic  Isotope Geochemistry Centre at Curtin University. Our recent research shows that microbial mats played important functions in several mass extinction events as well as a role in preserving remains of life including soft tissue of dead organisms under exceptional circumstances. Knowing more about the carbon dioxide levels present during the end Triassic mass extinction event provides us with important details that could help protect our environment and health of our ecosystems for future generations.

Dinosaurs were widespread globally at the time of the asteroid impact at the end of the Late Cretaceous epoch, occupying every continent on Earth and were the dominant form of animal of most terrestrial ecosystems. However, it is still contentious amongst paleobiologists as to whether dinosaurs were declining in diversity at the time of their extinction. In order to address this question, Joe Bonsor from the University of Bath and the Natural History Museum, London, and his colleagues collected a set of different dinosaur family trees and used statistical modeling to assess if each of the main dinosaur groups was still able to produce new species at this time. They used statistical methods to overcome sampling biases, looking at the rates of speciation of dinosaur families rather than simply counting the number of species belonging to the family. They found that dinosaurs were not in decline before the asteroid hit, contradicting some previous studies. They also suggest that had the impact not occurred, dinosaurs might have continued to be the dominant group of land animals on the planet. Previous studies done by others have used various methods to draw the conclusion that dinosaurs would have died out anyway, as they were in decline towards the end of the Cretaceous period, Bonsor said. However, we show that if you expand the dataset to include more recent dinosaur family trees and a broader set of dinosaur types, the results dont actually all point to this conclusion  in fact only about half of them do. The main point of our paper is that it isnt as simple as looking at a few trees and making a decision. The large unavoidable biases in the fossil record and lack of data can often show a decline in species, but this may not be a reflection of the reality at the time. Our data dont currently show they were in decline, in fact some groups such as hadrosaurs and ceratopsians were thriving and theres no evidence to suggest they would have died out 66 million years ago had the extinction event not happened.

The extinct Kiritimati sandpiper Prosobonia cancellata, a close cousin of the newly discovered Henderson sandpiper Prosobonia sauli. Illustration by George Edward Lodge, 1907. The newly described species of sandpiper is scientifically named Prosobonia sauli after Cook Islands based ornithologist and conservationist Edward K. Saul. The birds common name is the Henderson sandpiper. The fossilized bones of the bird were collected from caves and overhangs on Henderson Island in 1991 and 1992 during the Sir Peter Scott Commemorative Expedition to the Pitcairn Islands. The Henderson sandpiper is the fifth known species of Polynesian sandpiper. All but one of the species, the endangered Tuamotu sandpiper Prosobonia parvirostris, are extinct. We think Prosobonia sauli probably went extinct soon after humans arrived on Henderson Island, which archaeologists estimate happened no earlier than the eleventh century, said lead author Dr. Vanesa De Pietri, curator of natural history at the Canterbury Museum. Its possible these humans brought with them the Polynesian rat, which Polynesian sandpiper populations are very vulnerable to. Compared to the Tuamotu sandpiper, the Henderson sandpiper had longer legs and a wider, straighter bill, indicating how it foraged for food. It probably adapted to the habitats available on Henderson Island, which are different to those on other islands where Polynesian sandpipers were found. We found that Polynesian sandpipers are early diverging members of a group that includes calidrine sandpipers and turnstones, Dr. De Pietri said. They are unlike other sandpipers in that they are restricted to islands of the Pacific and do not migrate. Henderson Island is home to a number of unique species, a handful of which are landbirds like the Henderson sandpiper, said co author Dr. Paul Scofield, senior curator of natural history at the Canterbury Museum. The island is really quite remarkable because every landbird species that lives there, or that we know used to live there, is not found anywhere else. The study shows the need to protect the one remaining Polynesian sandpiper species, the Tuamotu sandpiper, Dr. De Pietri said. We know that just a few centuries ago there were at least five Polynesian sandpiper species scattered around the Pacific. Now theres only one, and its numbers are declining, so we need to ensure we look after the remaining populations. The discovery is described in a paper published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.

Both are thought to have evolved in the North Atlantic, with only two lineages subsequently crossing the equator. The third and oldest lineage, the monk seals, has been interpreted as exclusively northern and subtropical throughout their entire history. However, an international team of paleontologists now describes a new species of extinct monk seal that lived during the Pliocene epoch in New Zealand  the first of its kind from the southern hemisphere. The newly identified monk seal species lived in the waters around New Zealand some 3 million years ago. Named Eomonachus belegaerensis, the marine creature was around 2.5 m 8.2 feet in length and has a mass between 200 and 250 kg. This new species of extinct monk seal is the first of its kind from the southern hemisphere. Its discovery really turns seal evolution on its head, said lead author James Rule, a Ph.D. candidate in the Biomedicine Discovery Institute at Monash University and Museums Victoria. Until now, we thought that all true seals originated in the northern hemisphere, and then crossed the equator just once or twice during their entire evolutionary history. Instead, many of them appear to have evolved in the southern Pacific, and then criss crossed the equator up to eight times. Rule and his colleagues from New Zealand, Australia and the United States examined seven well preserved specimens of Eomonachus belegaerensis  including a complete skull  found by local fossil hunters on south Taranaki beaches in New Zealand between 2009 and 2016. This discovery was a triumph for citizen science, said co author Dr. Felix Marx, a curator of marine mammals at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa and a researcher in the Department of Geology at the University of Otago. This new species has been discovered thanks to numerous, exceptionally well preserved fossils  all of which were found by members of the public. Our results suggest that true seals crossed the equator over eight times in their history, the paleontologists concluded. Overall, they more than double the age of the north south dichotomy characterizing living true seals and confirms a surprisingly recent major change in southern true seal diversity. The discovery is reported in a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences.

Roy Smith, a PhD student at the University of Portsmouth, made the discovery while he was examining the fish fossils collected from the West Melbury Marly Chalk Formation about a century ago. The fossils were actually fragments of jaws of toothless pterosaurs, which do indeed resemble shark fin spines, but there are many subtle differences that allow them to be distinguished. One such feature is tiny little holes where nerves come to the surface and are used for sensitive feeding by the pterosaurs, Smith said. Shark fin spines do not have these, but the early paleontologists clearly missed these features. Two of the specimens analyzed by Smith and his colleagues can be identified as a pterosaur called Ornithostoma sedgwicki, but one additional specimen is clearly distinct and represents a new species in the pterosaur clade Azhdarchoidea. Unfortunately, this specimen is too fragmentary to be the basis for naming the new species, Smith said. It is doubtful if any more remains of this pterosaur will be discovered, as there are no longer any exposures of the rock from which the fossils came. The little bit of beak is tantalizing in that it is small, and simply differs from Ornithostoma in subtle ways, perhaps in the way that a great white egret might differ from a heron, said University of Portsmouths Professor Dave Martill, co author of the study. Likely the differences in life would have been more to do with color, call and behavior than in the skeleton. Pterosaurs with these types of beaks are better known at the time period from North Africa, so it would be reasonable to assume a likeness to the North African Alanqa. This is extremely exciting to have discovered this mystery pterosaur right here in the UK. This find is significant because it adds to our knowledge of these ancient and fascinating flying prehistoric reptiles, but also demonstrates that such discoveries can be made, simply by re examining material in old collections. The study appears in the Proceedings of the Geologists Association.

Kylinxia zhangi swam in the Early Cambrian seas, approximately 518 million years ago. The six specimens with well preserved soft parts of this ancient creature were found in the Yuanshan Formation in Yunnan province, southern China. They show an unexpected mix of distinctive features of true arthropods as well as more ancient features. Kylinxia zhangi had a fused head shield, a segmented trunk, and jointed legs. But it also had raptorial frontalmost appendages and five stalked compound eyes, of which the anterior forward facing two are at least twice as large as the posterior three. This configuration of eyes is reminiscent of the peculiar five eyes in Opabinia regalis, the paleontologists said. Kylinxia zhangi was a member of the Chengjiang biota, the most diverse assemblage of Early Cambrian marine fossils known. Among the Chengjiang fauna, the giant top predator Anomalocaris is considered the ancestral form of arthropod, the researchers said. But huge morphological differences exist between Anomalocaris and true arthropods. There is a great evolutionary gap between the two that can hardly be bridged. Our results indicate that the evolutionary placement of Kylinxia zhangi is right between Anomalocaris and the true arthropods, said co author Professor Maoyan Zhu, a paleontologist at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. Therefore, our finding reached the evolutionary root of the true arthropods. Kylinxia zhangi represents a crucial transitional fossil predicted by Darwins evolutionary theory, added lead author Dr. Han Zeng, also from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. It bridges the evolutionary gap from Anomalocaris to true arthropods and forms a key missing link in the origin of arthropods, contributing strong fossil evidence for the evolutionary theory of life.

"}, {"title": " Meet Ajnabia odysseus, First Duck-Billed Dinosaur from Africa", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Nov 5, 2020", "doc": "An international team of paleontologists has identified a new genus and species of lambeosaurine hadrosaur from fossils dug up in Morocco, North Africa. The newly discovered dinosaur, dubbed Ajnabia odysseus, roamed our planet some 66 million years ago during the Maastrichtian age of the Late Cretaceous epoch. The ancient creature was a member of Hadrosauridae, a large family of plant eating dinosaurs that grew up to 15 m 50 feet long. But Ajnabia odysseus was just 3 m 10 feet long  very small compared to its kin. The discovery of the new fossil in a mine a few hours from Casablanca was about the last thing in the world you would expect, said lead author Dr. Nicholas Longrich, a paleontologist in the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath. It was completely out of place, like finding a kangaroo in Scotland. Africa was completely isolated by water  so how did they get there? The fossilized jawbones and teeth of Ajnabia odysseus were found in the Office Ch\u00e9rifien des Phosphates mines at Sidi Chennane in Moroccos Khouribga province. The fossils show it belonged to Lambeosaurinae, a subfamily of hadrosaurs with elaborate bony head crests. These dinosaurs evolved in North America before spreading to Asia and Europe, but have never been found in Africa before. Because Africa was an island continent in the Late Cretaceous, isolated by deep seaways, they must have crossed hundreds of kilometers of open water  rafting on debris, floating, or swimming  to colonize the continent. Hadrosaurs were probably powerful swimmers  they had large tails and powerful legs, and are often found in river deposits and marine rocks, so they may have simply swum the distance. It was impossible to walk to Africa, Dr. Longrich said. These dinosaurs evolved long after continental drift split the continents, and we have no evidence of land bridges. The geology tells us Africa was isolated by oceans. If so, the only way to get there is by water. As far as I know, were the first to suggest ocean crossings for dinosaurs. The findings were published in the journal Cretaceous Research. "}, {"title": " New Cynodont Species Unearthed in Arizona", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Nov 5, 2020", "doc": "Paleontologists have uncovered a previously unknown species of cynodont that lived during the Triassic period in what is now Arizona, the United States. Cynodonts clade Cynodontia, literally meaning dog teeth, were one of the most diverse and successful groups of therapsids. They first appeared in the Late Permian epoch, approximately 260 million years ago, but diversified dramatically in the Triassic period. They include the direct ancestors of mammals, and so might yield clues about how modern mammals came to be as successful as they are. Scientifically named Kataigidodon venetus, the newly identified cynodont species lived some 220 million years ago. This discovery sheds light on the geography and environment during the early evolution of mammals, said lead author Ben Kligman, a doctoral student in the Department of Geosciences at Virginia Tech. It also adds to evidence that humid climates played an important role in the early evolution of mammals and their closest relatives. Kataigidodon venetus was living alongside dinosauromorphs and possibly early dinosaurs related to Coelophysis, and the cynodont was possibly prey of these early dinosaurs and other predators like crocodylomorphs, small coyote like quadrupedal predators related to living crocodiles. The two fossil lower jaws of Kataigidodon venetus were found in the Chinle Formation in the Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. Finding a fossil that is part of Cynodontia, which includes close cousins of mammals as well as true mammals, from Triassic rocks is an extremely rare event in North America, Kligman said. Prior to this discovery, the only other unambiguous cynodont fossil from the Late Triassic of western North America was the 1990 discovery of a braincase of Adelobasileus cromptoni in Texas. Because only the lower jaws of Kataigidodon venetus were discovered and are quite small  1.3 cm 0.5 inches, Kligman and colleagues only have a semi picture of how the creature looked, roughly 9 cm 3.5 inches in total body size, minus the tail. Along with the jawbone fossils, they found incisor, canine, and complex postcanine teeth, similar to modern day mammals. Given the pointed shape of its teeth and small body size, it likely fed on a diet of insects, Kligman said. About 220 million years ago, modern day Arizona and Texas were located close to the equator, near the center of the supercontinent Pangaea. Kataigidodon venetus would have been living in a lush tropical forest ecosystem. It likely would have looked like a small rat or mouse, Kligman said. If you were to see it in person you would think it is a mammal. A paper on the discovery was published in the journal Biology Letters. "}, {"title": " Rodent-Like Mammal from Cretaceous Period Lived in Colonies", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Nov 3, 2020", "doc": "Filikomys primaevus, a new genus and species of multituberculate mammal that lived during the Late Cretaceous epoch, has been identified from multi individual aggregates of skulls and skeletons found at a dinosaur nesting site in Montana, the United States. The well preserved fossils indicate that Filikomys primaevus engaged in multi generational, group nesting and burrowing behavior, representing the first example of social behavior in a Mesozoic mammal. Multituberculates were mostly small bodied, omnivorous or herbivorous mammals that lived between 166 and 35 million years ago, from the Middle Jurassic to the late Eocene. Most species of multituberculates are generally recovered as loose teeth preserved skulls and jaws are rare except in Mongolia. They are known from North America and Europe  which were a single continent until the early Eocene  in the uppermost Triassic to the lower Oligocene, and from northern Asia in the upper Cretaceous and Paleocene. Multituberculata is one of the most ancient mammal groups, and theyve been extinct for 35 million years, yet in the Late Cretaceous they were apparently interacting in groups similar to what you would see in modern day ground squirrels, said lead author Luke Weaver, a graduate student in the Department of Biology at the University of Washington. Filikomys primaevus roamed Earth during the Cretaceous period, about 75.5 million years ago. The fossilized skulls and skeletons of at least 22 individuals were recovered from a well known dinosaur nesting site called Egg Mountain in western Montana. They were typically clustered together in groups of two to five, with at least 13 individuals found within a 30 m2 area in the same rock layer. Based on how well preserved the fossils are, the type of rock theyre preserved in, and Filikomys primaevus powerful shoulders and elbows, Weaver and colleagues hypothesize these animals lived in burrows and were nesting together. Furthermore, the ancient animals were a mixture of multiple mature adults and young adults, suggesting these were truly social groups as opposed to just parents raising their young. Because humans are such social animals, we tend to think that sociality is somehow unique to us, or at least to our close evolutionary relatives, but now we can see that social behavior goes way further back in the mammalian family tree, Weaver said. Previously, paleontologists thought social behavior in mammals first emerged after the mass extinction that killed off the dinosaurs, and mostly in the Placentalia  the group of mammals humans belong to, which all carry the fetus in the mothers uterus until a late stage of development. But Filikomys primaevus shows mammals were socializing during the Age of Dinosaurs, and in an entirely different and more ancient group of mammals  the multituberculates. These fossils are game changers, said senior author Dr. Gregory Wilson Mantilla, a researcher in the Department of Biology at the University of Washington and the Burke Museum of Natural History  Culture. As paleontologists working to reconstruct the biology of mammals from this time period, were usually stuck staring at individual teeth and maybe a jaw that rolled down a river, but here we have multiple, near complete skulls and skeletons preserved in the exact place where the animals lived. We can now credibly look at how mammals really interacted with dinosaurs and other animals that lived at this time. The discovery of Filikomys primaevus is reported in a paper in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution. "}, {"title": " Researchers Unlocking Secrets of Dinosaur Eggshells", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Oct 30, 2020", "doc": "Scientists have studied the morphology and structure of Cretaceous period dinosaur eggshells collected from the El Gallo Formation of Baja California, Mexico. Dinosaurs were one of the most enigmatic and interesting species of animals that have existed on Earth. They lived in a variety of environments that ranged from forest to arid land, including the coast around the oceans. Non avian dinosaurs faced a period of extinction along the Earth, with the fossils found in different parts of the world being the only evidences of their existence. Since the sensational discovery of dinosaur eggs in Gobi Desert in the early 1920s, the remains of fossil eggshells, eggs, and nests have been found in the Mesozoic deposits  mostly from the Late Cretaceous epoch  on all continents. Just in North America alone, there exist at least 40 paleontological sites with fossilized dinosaur eggs and eggshells in Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Most of the works on the classification of fossil eggshells are based on their different characteristics such as the general morphology, pore shape, and thickness, but mainly the crystalline arrangement, said lead author Dr. Abel Moreno from the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico and colleagues. A few works focus on the element and the isotopic analysis that we carried out. These were done to find information about the possible body temperature of some of the dinosaur groups, but above all, we wanted to infer their paleoenvironmental conditions. In the study, the researchers examined five dinosaur eggshells found in the coastal area of El Rosario, Baja California. The three of the five eggs were laid by ornithopods of the hadrosaur family duck billed dinosaurs and one by a theropod of the troodontidae family small, bird like dinosaurs, they said. The remaining sample was too damaged to classify by the naked eye. Using high resolution scanning electron microscopy, the scientists analyzed the external and internal surfaces and a cross section of each eggshell. In contrast to the smooth outer surface of the theropod shell, the shells from the ornithopods and the unknown sample had nodes at different distances across the shell, they said. Images of shell cross sections from the ornithopods revealed that mammillary cones  calcite crystals on the inner surface of the shell  formed thin, elongated columns arranged in parallel, with irregular pores. In contrast, the eggshell from the theropod showed thicker, shorter cones arranged in a bilayer, with wider pores. The unknown sample more closely resembled the ornithopod eggshells, leading the authors to hypothesize that it was probably also from the hadrosaur family. In addition, we conducted an elemental composition analysis, which is the first such analysis on dinosaur eggshells collected in Mexico, they said. Our findings might help reveal how the fossilization process varied among species and localities. The results were published in the journal ACS Omega. "}, {"title": " Middle Triassic Nothosaur Had Built-In Float", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Oct 29, 2020", "doc": "Paleontologists have found two nearly complete skeletons from a new genus and species of nothosauroid marine reptile that lived during the Middle Triassic in what is now China. Dubbed Brevicaudosaurus jiyangshanensis, the ancient creature used its short and flat tail for balance and floated near the bottom of the edges in shallow water, picking off prey with fang like teeth. Brevicaudosaurus jiyangshanensis lived during the Triassic period, approximately 240 million years ago. The extinct reptile had a small head, fangs, flipper like limbs, a long neck, and a short and flat tail. The two nearly complete skeletons of Brevicaudosaurus jiyangshanensis were collected from a thin layer of limestone in two quarries in Fuyuan County, southwest China. The specimens were examined by Dr. Qing Hua Shang from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and colleagues. Our analysis of two well preserved skeletons reveals a reptile with a broad, pachyostotic body denser boned and a very short, flattened tail, they said. A long tail can be used to flick through the water, generating thrust, but the new species was probably better suited to hanging out near the bottom in shallow sea, using its short, flattened tail for balance, like an underwater float, allowing it to preserve energy while searching for prey. The forelimbs of Brevicaudosaurus jiyangshanensis are more strongly developed than its hind limbs, suggesting they played a role in helping the reptile to swim. However, the bones in the front feet are short compared to other species, limiting the power with which it could pull through the water. Most of the reptiles bones, including the vertebrae and ribs, are thick and dense, further contributing to the stocky, stout appearance and limiting its ability to swim quickly but increasing stability underwater. However, thick, high mass bones act as ballast. What Brevicaudosaurus jiyangshanensis lost in speed, it gained in stability. Dense bones, known as pachyostosis, may have made it neutrally buoyant in shallow water. Together with the flat tail, this would have helped the predator to float motionless underwater, requiring little energy to stay horizontal. Neutral buoyancy should also have enabled it to walk on the seabed searching for slow moving prey. Highly dense ribs of Brevicaudosaurus jiyangshanensis may also suggest the reptile had large lungs. As suggested by the lack of firm support of the body weight, nothosaurs were oceanic nut they needed to come to the water surface for oxygen. They have nostrils on the snout through which they breathed. Large lungs would have increased the time the species could spend under water. Brevicaudosaurus jiyangshanensis features a bar shaped bone in the middle ear called the stapes, used for sound transmission. The stapes was generally lost in other nothosaurs or marine reptiles during preservation. Paleontologists had predicted that if a stapes was found in a nothosaur, it would be thin and slender like in other species of this branch of the reptilian family tree. However, in Brevicaudosaurus jiyangshanensis it is thick and elongate, suggesting it had good hearing underwater. Perhaps this small, slow swimming marine reptile had to be vigilante for large predators as it floated in the shallows, as well as being a predator itself, said Dr. Xiao Chun Wu, a researcher at the Canadian Museum of Nature. The discovery is reported in a paper published today in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. "}, {"title": " Pterosaurs Evolved Their Flight Ability over Millions of Years: Study", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Oct 29, 2020", "doc": "In a new study published this week in the journal Nature, a team of researchers from the United Kingdom combined fossil records with a new model of flight to measure flight efficiency in pterosaurs and fill in gaps in our knowledge of their evolutionary story. The scientists were able to track the gradual evolution of pterosaurs and demonstrate they became twice as good at flying over their 150 million year existence. The authors also showed their evolution was caused by consistent small improvements over a long period, rather than sudden evolutionary bursts as had been previously suggested. Pterosaurs were Earths first winged vertebrates, with birds and bats making their appearances much later. They thrived from about 210 to 65 million years ago, when they were wiped out by the asteroid that also doomed the non avian dinosaurs. Some pterosaurs, such as the giant azhdarchids, were the largest flying animals of all time, with wingspans exceeding 9.1 m 30 feet and standing heights comparable to modern giraffes. Pterosaurs diverged from dinosaur ancestors in the Early Triassic epoch around 245 million years ago. However, the first fossils of pterosaurs are dated to 25 million years later, in the Late Triassic epoch. Therefore, in the absence of proto pterosaur fossils, it is difficult to study how flight first evolved in this group. Despite their eventual prowess in the air being well known, the question of whether pterosaurs got better at flying, and whether this gave them an advantage over their ancestors, has puzzled scientists for decades, said Professor Chris Venditti, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading. There are many examples of how natural selection works on relatively short time scales but, until now, it has been very difficult to demonstrate whether plants or animals adapt to become more efficient over a long period. Our new method has allowed us to study long term evolution in a completely new way and answer this question at last by comparing the creatures at different stages of their evolutionary sequence over many millions of years. Professor Venditti and colleagues monitored changes to pterosaur flight efficiency by using fossils to measure their wingspan and body size at different stages. Their new model based on living birds was applied to the data for 75 pterosaur species, which showed that pterosaurs gradually got better at flying over millions of years. The models showed that pterosaurs adapted their body shape and size, so they used 50 less energy when flying, over their 150 million year history. They showed the creatures increased in mass ten fold, with some eventually weighing more than 300 kg. The new method also revealed that the azhdarchoid pterosaurs were an exception to the rule. Paleontologists have disagreed over how well these animals flew, but the new study showed that they did not get any better throughout their existence. The enlarged size of azhdarchoids appeared to provide their survival advantage instead, with one animal, Quetzalcoatlus, growing to the height of a giraffe. This is unique evidence that although these animals were competent fliers, they probably spent much of their time on the ground, said Dr. Joanna Baker, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Reading. Highly efficient flight probably didnt offer them much of an advantage, and our finding that they had smaller wings for their body size is in line with fossil evidence for their reduced reliance on flight. Among the few things that havent changed over the last 300 million years are the laws of physics, so it has been great to use those laws to understand the evolution of flight in these amazing animals, said Professor Stuart Humphries, a biophysicist at the University of Lincoln. Until recently, paleontologists could describe the anatomy of creatures based on their fossils and work out their functions, said Professor Mike Benton, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol. Its really exciting now to be able to calculate the operational efficiency of extinct animals, and then to compare them through their evolution to see how efficiency has changed. We dont just have to look at the fossils with amazement, but can really get to grips with what they tell us. "}, {"title": " New Fossils of Giant Bony-Toothed Birds Found in Antarctica", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Oct 28, 2020", "doc": "Paleontologists have described new fossils of pelagornithid birds from the middle Eocene Submeseta Formation on Seymour Island, Antarctica. Pelagornithids are an extinct group of large flying birds with a fossil record spanning from the late Paleocene to the late Pliocene and a global distribution. Also known as bony toothed birds, they had bony projections, or struts, on their jaws that resemble sharp pointed teeth, though they are not true teeth. Called pseudoteeth, the struts helped the birds snag squid and fish from the sea as they soared for perhaps weeks at a time over much of Earths oceans. Though a much smaller pelagornithid fossil dates from 62 million years ago, one of the newly described specimens  a 50 million year old portion of a birds foot tarsometatarsus  shows that the larger pelagornithids arose just after life rebounded from the end Cretaceous mass extinction 66 million years ago, when non avian dinosaurs went extinct. The second pelagornithid fossil from Seymour Island, part of a jaw bone, dates from about 40 million years ago. Our fossil discovery, with its estimate of a 5 6 m 16 20 foot wingspan shows that birds evolved to a truly gigantic size relatively quickly after the extinction of the dinosaurs and ruled over the oceans for millions of years, said lead author Peter Kloess, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. The fossils that Kloess and colleagues described are among many collected in the mid 1980s on Seymour Island, off the northernmost tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. They examined the pelagornithid tarsometatarsus and realized that it came from an older geological formation than originally thought. That meant that the fossil was about 50 million years old instead of 40 million years old. It is the largest specimen known for the entire extinct group of pelagornithids. The other rediscovered fossil, the middle portion of the lower jaw, has parts of its pseudoteeth preserved. They would have been up to 3 cm 1 inch tall when the bird was alive. The approximately 12 cm 5 inch  long preserved section of jaw came from a very large skull that would have been up to 60 cm 2 feet long. Using measurements of the size and spacing of those teeth and analytical comparisons to other fossils of pelagornithids, the paleontologists were able to show that this fragment came from an individual bird as big, if not bigger, than the largest known skeletons of the bony toothed bird group. These Antarctic fossils demonstrate the early evolution of giant body size in this clade by\u200950 million years ago, the researchers said. They likely represent not only the largest flying birds of the Eocene period but also some of the largest flying birds that ever lived. Furthermore, the distribution of giant sized pelagornithid fossils across more than 10 million years of Antarctic geological deposits points to a prolonged survival of giant sized pelagornithids within the southern seas, and their success as a pelagic predatory component of marine and coastal ecosystems alongside early penguins. The teams paper was published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Tides are a major component of the interaction between the marine and terrestrial environments. They play an important part in shaping the environmental context for the evolution of shallow marine and coastal organisms. During long periods of the Earths history, weve had small tidal ranges, said Professor Per Ahlberg, a researcher in the Department of Organismal Biology at Uppsala University. But in the Late Silurian and Early Devonian, they seem to have been large in some parts of the world. These results appear highly robust, because even if we changed model variables such as ocean depth, we got the same patterns. For the study, Professor Ahlberg and colleagues used a dedicated tidal model and paleogeographic reconstructions from this critical period to explore the potential significance of tides for the evolution of bony fish and land vertebrates. Their first of their kind results show tidal variations in excess of 4 m 13.1 feet occurring around an area known as the South China block, which is the site of the origin and diversification of the earliest bony fish group, and has produced the earliest important fossils for this group. Geological evidence also points to tidal environments being closely associated with this class of fossils. These results also stimulate the need for more detailed tidal simulations of the ancient Earth. In particular, the researchers believe that their method can be used with a variety of paleogeographic reconstructions at other time periods, to explore the tidal influence upon the origin and diversification of other early vertebrates, and perhaps the opposite as well what might have been the role of tides in precipitating marine extinction events? Our results open the door to further and even more detailed tidal analyses of key episodes in Earths past, Professor Ahlberg said. The method can be used to explore the possible role of tides in other evolutionary processes of vertebrate development. And perhaps, conversely, whether tides, with their influence on ocean dynamics, played a part in the big marine extinctions that have taken place again and again in Earths history.

Jucha squalea swam the worlds oceans during the Early Cretaceous epoch, approximately 130 million years ago. This marine reptile belongs to Elasmosauridae, a family of plesiosaurs characterized by extremely long necks and slim bodies. Plesiosaurian marine reptiles evolved a wide range of body shapes during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, including long necked forms, Dr. Fischer and colleagues wrote in their paper. Many Late Cretaceous members of the Elasmosauridae clade epitomized this part of the plesiosaurian morphological spectrum by evolving extremely long necks through somitogenesis resulting in an increase in the number of cervical centra and differential growth resulting in the elongation of cervical centra. However, the early evolution of elasmosaurids remains poorly understood because of a generally poor Lower Cretaceous fossil record. The partial skeleton of a mature individual of Jucha squalea was unearthed in 2007 in the vicinity of the Slantsevy Rudnik village near Ulyanovsk in Eastern Europe. Jucha squalea represents one of the geologically oldest occurrences of elasmosaurids, the paleontologists wrote. It lacks a series of features that otherwise characterize the group, such as the pectoral bar and the heart shaped intercoracoid fenestra, and thus documents some of the earliest stages of the elasmosaurid radiation. Jucha squalea marks an early attempt at cervical elongation in elasmosaurids via differential growth, possessing anterior cervical centra that are much more elongated than those of other early xenopsarians, they added. The cervical shape values we gathered suggest that elasmosaurids underwent multiple episodes of cervical shortening, notably during the Early Cretaceous. The teams paper was published online in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.

They had skin stretched between elongate fingers that form a potential membranous wing. Most theropods were ground loving carnivores, but Yi qi and Ambopteryx longibrachium were at home in the trees and lived on a diet of insects, seeds, and other plants. According to a new study published in the journal iScience, Yi qi and Ambopteryx longibrachium struggled to fly, only managing to glide clumsily between the trees where they lived unable to compete with other tree dwelling dinosaurs and early birds, they went extinct after just a few million years. Once birds got into the air, these two species were so poorly capable of being in the air that they just got squeezed out, said first author Dr. Thomas Dececchi, a researcher in the Department of Biology at Mount Marty University. Maybe you can survive a few million years underperforming, but you have predators from the top, competition from the bottom, and even some small mammals adding into that, squeezing them out until they disappeared. Curious about how Yi qi and Ambopteryx longibrachium fly, Dr. Dececchi and colleagues scanned fossils using laser stimulated fluorescence, a technique that uses laser light to pick up soft tissue details that cant be seen with standard white light. They then used mathematical models to predict how these dinosaurs might have flown, testing many different variables like weight, wingspan, and muscle placement. They really cant do powered flight. You have to give them extremely generous assumptions in how they can flap their wings, Dr. Dececchi said. You basically have to model them as the biggest bat, make them the lightest weight, make them flap as fast as a really fast bird, and give them muscles higher than they were likely to have had to cross that threshold. They could glide, but even their gliding wasnt great, he noted. While gliding is not an efficient form of flight, since it can only be done if the animal has already climbed to a high point, it did help Yi qi and Ambopteryx longibrachium stay out of danger while they were still alive. If an animal needs to travel long distances for whatever reason, gliding costs a bit more energy at the start, but its faster. It can also be used as an escape hatch, Dr. Dececchi said. Its not a great thing to do, but sometimes its a choice between losing a bit of energy and being eaten. Once they were put under pressure, they just lost their space. They couldnt win on the ground. They couldnt win in the air. They were done. The authors are now looking at the muscles that powered Yi qi and Ambopteryx longibrachium to construct an accurate image of these bizarre little creatures. Im used to working with the earliest birds, and we sort of have an idea of what they looked like already, Dr. Dececchi said. To work where were just trying to figure out the possibilities for a weird creature is kind of fun.

Pterosaurs are highly successful flying reptiles that lived at the same time as dinosaurs, between 210 million and 65 million years ago. They were Earths first flying vertebrates, with birds and bats making their appearances much later. Some pterosaurs, such as the giant azhdarchids, were the largest flying animals of all time, with wingspans exceeding 9 m 30 feet and standing heights comparable to modern giraffes. The newly identified species, dubbed Ordosipterus planignathus, lived between 120 and 110 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. This flying reptile belongs to Dsungaripteridae, a family of robust pterosaurs that includes several genera and species from Asia and South America. As a member of the Dsungaripteridae family, Ordosipterus planignathus enlarges the geographical distribution of the dsungaripterid pterosaurs from the northwestern China  with western Mongolia  to central North China, said Dr. Shu an Ji, a paleontologist in the Institute of Geology at the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences and the Key Laboratory of Stratigraphy and Palaeontology at Chinas Ministry of Natural Resources. The fossilized remains of Ordosipterus planignathus were found in the Luohandong Formation near Xinzhao village in Inner Mongolia, China. The specimen consists of the anterior portion of articulated lower jaws, with a partial tooth and several alveoli, Dr. Ji said. The rostral tip of the mandibular symphysis is missing. The preserved segments of the left and right dentaries measure 7.7 cm 3 inches and 4.5 cm 1.8 inches long, respectively. Ordosipterus planignathus represents the first convincible pterosaur from the Ordos Region in Inner Mongolia, and the second pterosaur species from the Ordos Basin after Huanhepterus quingyangensis in Gansu Province, he concluded. This fossil further strengthens the opinion that the northern China and Mongolia belong to a unique and endemic dinosaur biogeographic realm featured by the presence of Psittacosaurus and pterosaurs during the Early Cretaceous period. The discovery of Ordosipterus planignathus is described in a paper published in the journal China Geology.

The catastrophe killed off nearly 96 of all marine species and 70 of terrestrial vertebrate species on the planet over the course of thousands of years. Massive eruptions in a volcanic system called the Siberian Traps are thought to have played an important role, but the causational trigger and its feedbacks are yet to be fully understood. Now, a research team led by Dr. Hana Jurikova from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Zentrum f\u00fcr Ozeanforschung Kiel and the Helmholtz Zentrum Potsdam has assembled a consistent biogeochemical reconstruction of the mechanisms that resulted in the end Permian extinction. Dr. Jurikova and her colleagues studied isotopes of the element boron in the calcareous shells of fossil brachiopods and determined the rate of ocean acidification over the Permian Triassic boundary. These are clam like organisms that have existed on Earth for more than 500 million years, Dr. Jurikova said. We were able to use well preserved brachiopod fossils from the Southern Alps for our analyses. These shells were deposited at the bottom of the shallow shelf seas of the Tethys Ocean 252 million years ago and recorded the environmental conditions shortly before and at the beginning of extinction. Because the ocean pH and atmospheric carbon dioxide are closely coupled, the researchers were able to reconstruct changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide at the onset of the extinction from boron and carbon isotopes. They then used an innovative geochemical model to study the impact of the carbon dioxide injection on the environment. With this technique, we can not only reconstruct the evolution of the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, but also clearly trace it back to volcanic activity, said co author Dr. Marcus Gutjahr, a researcher at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Zentrum f\u00fcr Ozeanforschung Kiel. The dissolution of methane hydrates, which had been suggested as a potential further cause, is highly unlikely based on our data. Without these new techniques it would be difficult to reconstruct environmental processes more than 250 million years ago in the same level of detail as we have done now, said co author Professor Anton Eisenhauer, also from the GEOMAR Helmholtz Zentrum f\u00fcr Ozeanforschung Kiel. The teams findings showed that volcanic eruptions in Siberian Traps released immense amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This release lasted several millennia and led to a strong greenhouse effect on the late Permian world, causing extreme warming and acidification of the ocean. Dramatic changes in chemical weathering on land altered productivity and nutrient cycling in the ocean, and ultimately led to vast de oxygenation of the ocean. The resulting multiple environmental stressors combined to wipe out a wide variety of animal and plant groups. We are dealing with a cascading catastrophe in which the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere set off a chain of events that successively extinguished almost all life in the seas, Dr. Jurikova said. Ancient volcanic eruptions of this kind are not directly comparable to anthropogenic carbon emissions, and in fact all modern fossil fuel reserves are far too insufficient to release as much carbon dioxide over hundreds of years, let alone thousands of years as was released 252 million years ago. But it is astonishing that humanitys carbon dioxide emission rate is currently 14 times higher than the annual emission rate at the time that marked the greatest biological catastrophe in Earths history.

It represents the earliest known example of a dentary bone with double molariform roots and a crown with two rows of cusps, and offers insight into mammal tooth evolution, particularly the development of double rooted teeth. The newly discovered mammaliaform species was a shrew like animal about the size of a large mouse, probably covered with fur. Named Kalaallitkigun jenkinsi, it lived during the Late Triassic epoch, around 215 million years ago. Its partial left dentary, with two teeth still preserved in their respective alveoli, was found at the Liasryggen site located on the left bank of the Carlsberg Fjord, Jameson Land, East Greenland. I knew it was important from the moment I took this 2 cm 0.8 inches specimen off the ground, said Dr. Grzegorz Niedzwiedzki, a paleontologist in the Department of Organismal Biology in the Evolutionary Biology Centre at Uppsala University. Kalaallitkigun jenkinsi exhibits the earliest known dentary with two rows of cusps on molars and double rooted teeth. These anatomical features place it as an intermediate between the mammals and the insectivorous morganucodontans, another type of mammaliaform. The structural changes in the teeth are related to changed feeding habits, the researchers said. The animals were switching to a more omnivorousherbivorous diet and the tooth crown was expanding laterally. Broader teeth with basins on the top surface are better for grinding food. This development also forced changes in the structure of the base of the tooth. Our discovery of the oldest mammalian ancestor with double rooted molars shows how important the role of teeth was in the origin of mammals, said Dr. Tomasz Sulej, a researcher in the Institute of Paleobiology at the Polish Academy of Sciences. I had this idea to look at the biomechanics and the collaboration with the engineers turned out great. It seems that the fossils of close mammalian ancestors must be looked for in even older rocks. The discovery is reported in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Their results demonstrate that this extinct species was highly divergent from all living cat species and did not undergo any detectable gene flow with living cat species after their initial diversification 14 million years ago. Homotherium was a genus of large bodied scimitar toothed cats, morphologically distinct from any living cat species, that went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. They possessed large, saber form serrated canine teeth, powerful forelimbs, a sloping back, and an enlarged optic bulb, all of which were key characteristics for predation on Pleistocene megafauna. Previous studies of mitochondrial DNA suggested that Homotherium was a highly divergent sister lineage to all living cat species. Their genetic makeup hints towards scimitar toothed cats being highly skilled hunters, said senior co author Dr. Michael Westbury, a postdoctoral researcher in the GLOBE Institute at the University of Copenhagen. They likely had very good daytime vision and displayed complex social behaviors. They had genetic adaptations for strong bones and cardiovascular and respiratory systems, meaning they were well suited for endurance running. Based on this, we think they hunted in a pack until their prey reached exhaustion with an endurance based hunting style during the day light hours. To examine the evolutionary history of Homotherium, Dr. Westbury and colleagues extracted DNA from a fossil of Homotherium latidens recovered from Pleistocene permafrost sediments near Dawson City, Yukon Territory, Canada. The specimen was so old it could not be dated using conventional radio carbon dating meaning that it was at least 47,500 years old. The researchers then used a variety of modern genomic sequencing techniques to map the entire nuclear genome of the ancient species. We know that genetic diversity correlates to how many of a given species that exists, Dr. Westbury said. Based on this, our best guess is that there were a lot of these big cats around. This also makes perfect sense given that their fossils have been found on every single continent except Australia and Antarctica. The analysis showed that Homotherium latidens is very distantly related to all modern cats and diverged from them about 22.5 million years ago, close to the OligoceneMiocene boundary. The scientists also found evidence of positive selection in several genes involved in vision, cognitive function, and energy consumption, potentially consistent with the diurnal and huntingsocial behavior of this extinct lineage. Finally, the authors uncovered relatively high levels of genetic diversity in the individual they studied, suggesting that it was not only a successful lineage, but also rather abundant relative to living cat species. This was an extremely successful family of cats, said first author Dr. Ross Barnet, also from the GLOBE Institute at the University of Copenhagen. They were present on five continents and roamed the earth for millions of years before going extinct. The current geological period is the first time in 40 million years that the Earth has lacked saber tooth predators. We just missed them. The results were published in the journal Current Biology.

The end Permian extinction, also known as the Permian Triassic extinction event and the Great Dying, is the Earths most severe mass extinction that peaked about 252.3 million years ago. The catastrophe killed off nearly 96 of all marine species and 70 of terrestrial vertebrate species on the planet over the course of thousands of years. Calculations of sea water temperature indicate that at the peak of the extinction, the Earth underwent hot global warming, in which equatorial ocean temperatures exceeded 40 degrees Celsius 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Among the possible causes of this event, and one of the most long hypothesized, is that massive burning coal led to catastrophic global warming, which in turn was devastating to life. Two main groups of tetrapods survived, the synapsids and archosaurs, including ancestors of mammals and birds respectively. Paleontologists had identified indications of warm bloodedness endothermy in these Triassic survivors, including evidence for a diaphragm and possible whiskers in the synapsids. More recently, similar evidence for early origin of feathers in dinosaur and bird ancestors has come to light. In both synapsids and archosaurs of the Triassic, the bone structure shows characteristics of warm bloodedness. The evidence that mammal ancestors had hair from the beginning of the Triassic has been suspected for a long time, but the suggestion that archosaurs had feathers from 250 million years ago is new. But a strong hint for this sudden origin of warm bloodedness in both synapsids and archosaurs at exactly the time of the Permian Triassic mass extinction was found in 2009. In their research, University of Bristols Professor Mike Benton and Masters student Tai Kubo analyzed fossilized footprints and found that all medium sized and large tetrapods switched from sprawling to erect posture right at the Permian Triassic boundary. The paleontologists looked at a sample of hundreds of fossil trackways, and they were surprised to see the posture shift happened instantly, not strung out over tens of millions of years, as had been suggested. It also happened in all groups, not just the mammal ancestors or bird ancestors. Modern amphibians and reptiles are sprawlers, holding their limbs partly sideways, Professor Benton said. Birds and mammals have erect postures, with the limbs immediately below their bodies. This allows them to run faster, and especially further. There are great advantages in erect posture and warm bloodedness, but the cost is that endotherms have to eat much more than cold blooded animals just to fuel their inner temperature control. The evidence from posture change and from early origin of hair and feathers, all happening at the same time, suggested this was the beginning of a kind of arms race. The Triassic was a remarkable time in the history of life on Earth. You see birds and mammals everywhere on land today, whereas amphibians and reptiles are often quite hidden, Professor Benton said. This revolution in ecosystems was triggered by the independent origins of endothermy in birds and mammals, but until recently we\u00a0didnt realize that these two events might have been coordinated. That happened because only a tiny number of species survived the Permian Triassic mass extinction  who survived depended on intense competition in a tough world. Because a few of the survivors were already endothermic in a primitive way, all the others had to become endothermic to survive in the new fast paced world. The study was published in the journal Gondwana Research.

The human tracks at White Sands National Park record more than 1.5 km 0.93 miles of an out  and return journey. They show the footprints of a woman or an adolescent male that are joined, at point, by the footprints of a toddler. An adolescent or small adult female made two trips separated by at least several hours, carrying a young child in at least one direction, said lead author Dr. Sally Reynold of Bournemouth University and colleagues. The team found the tracks in a dried up lakebed, which contains a range of other footprints dating from 11,550 to 13,000 years ago. The lakebeds formerly muddy surface preserved footprints for thousands of years as it dried up. When I first saw the intermittent toddler footprints, a familiar scene came to mind, said Dr. Thomas Urban, a researcher at Cornell University. This research is important in helping us understand our human ancestors, how they lived, their similarities and differences, Dr. Reynold said. We can put ourselves in the shoes, or footprints, of this person and imagine what it was like to carry a child from arm to arm as we walk across tough terrain surrounded by potentially dangerous animals. The scientists previously found the footprints of mammoths, giant sloths, saber toothed cats and dire wolves at the site. Giant ground sloths and Columbian mammoths were found to have intersected the human tracks after they were made, showing that this terrain hosted both humans and large animals at the same time, making the journey taken by this individual and child a dangerous one, they said.

The new pterosaur species, named Leptostomia begaaensis, lived between 113 and 94 million years ago mid Cretaceous period. The flying reptile had a very long flattened toothless beak, and was similar in size to a turkey. It likely used its beak to probe dirt and mud for hidden prey. The diets and hunting strategies of pterosaurs were diverse  they likely ate meat, fish and insects. The giant pterosaurs probably ate whatever they wanted, said co author Professor David Martill, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth. Some species hunted food on the wing, others stalked their prey on the ground. Now, the fragments of this remarkable little pterosaur show a lifestyle previously unknown for pterosaurs. Leptostomia begaaensis may actually have been a fairly common pterosaur, but its so strange  people have probably been finding bits of this beast for years, but we didnt know what they were until now, said senior author Dr. Nick Longrich, a paleontologist in the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath. The upper and lower jaws of Leptostomia begaaensis were recovered from the Cretaceous period layers of the Kem Kem Basin in Morocco, North Africa. Professor Martill, Dr. Longrich and their colleagues used CT scans to reveal an incredible network of internal canals for nerves that helped detect the prey underground. Weve never seen anything like this little pterosaur before, Professor Martill said. The bizarre shape of the beak was so unique, at first the fossils werent recognized as a pterosaur. The morphology of Leptostomia begaaensis beak most closely resembles that of probing birds such as kiwis, ibises, and curlews that probe in mud or earth for invertebrates. The pterosaur could probably have done either, but its presence in the Kem Kem Formation  representing a rich ecosystem of rivers and estuaries  suggests it was drawn there to feed on aquatic prey. You might think of the pterosaur as imitating the strategy used successfully by modern birds, but it was the pterosaur that got there first, Dr. Longrich said. Birds just reinvented what pterosaurs had already done tens of millions of years earlier. The teams paper was published in the journal Cretaceous Research.

The discovery indicates that this monkey species existed in Asia at the same time as apes, and is probably the ancestor of some of the modern monkeys in the area. This is significant because they are some of the very oldest fossils of monkeys outside of Africa, said Professor Nina Jablonski, an anthropologist in the Department of Anthropology at the Pennsylvania State University. It is close to or actually the ancestor of many of the living monkeys of East Asia. One of the interesting things from the perspective of paleontology is that this monkey occurs at the same place and same time as ancient apes in Asia. Professor Jablonski and colleagues studied the 6.4 million year old lower jawbone and the upper portion of the leg bone found in the Shuitangba mine. The two specimens were found in close proximity and are probably from the same individual of Mesopithecus pentelicus. Also uncovered slightly lower was a left calcaneus heel bone that belongs to the same species. This specimen was examined by a research team led by Dr. Dionisios Youlatos from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and Dr. Xueping Ji from the Yunnan Institute of Cultural Relics and Yunnan University. The significance of the calcaneus is that it reveals the monkey was well adapted for moving nimbly and powerfully both on the ground and in the trees, Professor Jablonski said. This locomotor versatility no doubt contributed to the success of the species in dispersing across woodland corridors from Europe to Asia. The jawbone and the upper portion of the leg bone indicate that the individual was female. They suggest that these monkeys were probably jacks of all trades able to navigate in the trees and on land. The teeth indicate they could eat a wide variety of plants, fruits and flowers, while apes eat mostly fruit. The thing that is fascinating about this monkey, that we know from molecular anthropology, is that, like other colobines Old World monkeys, it had the ability to ferment cellulose, Professor Jablonski said. It had a gut similar to that of a cow. These monkeys are successful because they can eat low quality food high in cellulose and obtain sufficient energy by fermenting the food and using the subsequent fatty acids then available from the bacteria. A similar pathway is used by ruminant animals like cows, deer and goats. Monkeys and apes would have been eating fundamentally different things, Professor Jablonski said. Apes eat fruits, flowers, things easy to digest, while monkeys eat leaves, seeds and even more mature leaves if they have to. Because of this different digestion, they dont need to drink free water, getting all their water from vegetation. These monkeys do not have to live near bodies of water and can survive periods of dramatic climatic change. These monkeys are the same as those found in Greece during the same time period, Professor Jablonski said. Suggesting they spread out from a center somewhere in central Europe and they did it fairly quickly. That is impressive when you think of how long it takes for an animal to disperse tens of thousands of kilometers through forest and woodlands. While there is evidence that Mesopithecus pentelicus began in Eastern Europe and moved out from there, the exact patterns are unknown, but the dispersal was rapid in evolutionary terms. During the end of the Miocene when this monkey species was moving out of Eastern Europe, apes were becoming extinct or nearly so, everywhere except in Africa and parts of Southeast Asia. The Late Miocene was a period of dramatic environmental change, Professor Jablonski said. What we have at this site is a fascinating snapshot of the end of the Miocene  complete with one of the last apes and one of the new order of monkeys. This is an interesting case in primate evolution because it testifies to the value of versatility and adaptability in diverse and changing environments. It shows that once a highly adaptable form sets out, it is successful and can become the ancestral stock of many other species. The research appears in two papers in the Journal of Human Evolution.

About 66 million years ago, a 12 km diameter asteroid collided with the Yucat\u00e1n carbonate platform of the southern Gulf of Mexico, formed the Chicxulub impact crater, and ultimately resulted in the end Cretaceous mass extinction of 76 species, including the non avian dinosaurs. The target rock was heated, vaporized, and ejected during the impact event. This released sulfate aerosols and dust, and possibly soot, into Earths upper atmosphere, which cooled and darkened the planet  a scenario known as an impact winter. Organic burn markers are observed in end Cretaceous boundary records globally, but their source is debated. The source of burn markers and whether they were caused by wildfires or rock carbon directly affects our understanding of the consequences of the impact that happened 66 million years ago, said co author Professor John Curtin, a researcher in the Western Australia Organic and Isotope Geochemistry Centre at Curtin University. When the impact occurred, the target rock was heated, vaporised and ejected, releasing sulphate aerosols, dust and possibly soot from the impact site. Professor Grice and colleagues were able to show that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, together with these organic materials, initiated an impact winter and global darkening that caused the mass extinction. The cause of the burn markers has been debated for more than 30 years, as some researchers believed they were caused by wildfires which were ignited by the impact of the crash, said first author Dr. Shelby Lyons, a scientist in the Department of Geosciences at the Pennsylvania State University.

The new mosasaur species swam in the oceans between 72 and 66 million years ago Cretaceous period. Scientifically named Gavialimimus almaghribensis, it had a long, narrow snout and interlocking teeth  similar to gharials, relatives of crocodiles and alligators. This discovery adds a layer of clarity to a diverse picture seemingly overcrowded with mega predators all competing for food, space and resources, said lead author Catie Strong, a student in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta. Its long snout reflects that this mosasaur was likely adapted to a specific form of predation, or niche partitioning, within this larger ecosystem. There is evidence that each mosasaur species shows adaptations for different prey items or styles of predation. For some species, these adaptations can be very prominent, such as the extremely long snout and the interlocking teeth in Gavialimimus almaghribensis, which we hypothesized as helping it to catch rapidly moving prey, Strong said. Another distinctive species would be Globidens simplex, which has stout, globular teeth adapted for crushing hard prey like shelled animals. Not all of the adaptations in these dozen or so species are this dramatic, and in some cases there may have been some overlap in prey items, but overall there is evidence that theres been diversification of these species into different niches, she said. Alternatively, the main contrasting hypothesis would be a scenario of more direct competition among species. Given the anatomical differences among these mosasaurs, though, the idea of niche partitioning seems more consistent with the anatomy of these various species, Strong said. This does help give another dimension to that diversity and shows how all of these animals living at the same time in the same place were able to branch off and take their own paths through evolution to be able to coexist like that. The discovery of Gavialimimus almaghribensis is described in a paper in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology.

Dubbed Oksoko avarsan, the ancient animal was about 2 m 6.6 feet long and had a large, toothless beak. It had one less finger on each forearm than its close relatives, suggesting an adaptability which enabled the animals to spread during the Late Cretaceous. Multiple associated skeletons of Oksoko avarsan were collected from the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi Desert. Oksoko avarsan represents the sixth genus of oviraptorid and ninth genus of oviraptorosaur from the Nemegt Formation, adding to previous evidence for a remarkable diversity of oviraptorosaurs in the Maastrichtian of Asia, said University of Edinburgh paleontologist Gregory Funston and colleagues. The remarkably well preserved fossils provided the first evidence of digit loss in the three fingered family of dinosaurs known as oviraptors. The discovery that oviraptorosaurs could evolve forelimb adaptations suggests the group could alter their diets and lifestyles, and enabled them to diversify and multiply. The researchers also discovered that Oksoko avarsan  like many other dinosaur species  were social as juveniles. The fossillized remains of four young dinosaurs were preserved resting together. Oksoko avarsan is interesting because the skeletons are very complete and the way they were preserved resting together shows that juveniles roamed together in groups, Dr. Funston said. But more importantly, its two fingered hand prompted us to look at the way the hand and forelimb changed throughout the evolution of oviraptors  which hadnt been studied before. This revealed some unexpected trends that are a key piece in the puzzle of why oviraptors were so diverse before the extinction that killed the dinosaurs. The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

Named Ogresuchus furatus, the ancient crocodile lived approximately 71.5 million years ago Late Cretaceous epoch. It belongs to the family Sebecidae in the clade Sebecosuchia, a group of highly specialized crocodyliforms that diversified during the Cretaceous and persisted until the end of the Miocene. These creatures were active terrestrial predators that could even compete with medium size carnivorous dinosaurs. Ogresuchus furatus was about 1.1 m 3.6 feet long and had a body mass of 9 kg, making it one of the smallest and lightest sebecosuchids ever discovered. The main feature of sebecids is that, unlike extant crocodiles, they had their limbs under their body, said lead author Dr. Albert Selles, a paleontologist at the Institut Catal\u00e0 de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont, the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona and the Museu de La Conca Dell\u00e0. This anatomical trait would have allowed the animal to move in a similar way to extant mammals and become efficient predators. The skeletal remains of Ogresuchus furatus and numerous eggshell fragments were found in a nesting ground of titanosaurian dinosaurs at the paleontological site of El Mirador in Coll de Narg\u00f3 area, Lleida Province, Catalonia. Probably the young dinosaurs were not its main source of food, but they would have been an easy prey, according to the anatomical features of this crocodile, Dr. Sell\u00e9s said. Ogresuchus furatus also represents the earliest record of Sebecidae worldwide and the first known from Eurasia. Ogresuchus furatus is 10 million years older than any other sebecid known to date, so this finding drives us to redefine the evolutionary history of the whole family, Dr. Selles and colleagues said. According to our interpretations, sebecids may have originated prior to the full break of Gondwana.

Osteostraci osteostracans is a group of extinct bony armored jawless fish that lived in what are now North America, Europe and Asia from the Middle Silurian to Late Devonian epoch. These bottom dwelling creatures were probably relatively good swimmers, possessing dorsal fins, paired pectoral fins, and a strong tail. The shield of bone covering their head formed a single piece, and so presumably did not grow during adult life. Many possessed bizarre horn like extensions from the front of their heads. The evolution of jaws and fins has classically been seen as the key evolutionary inventions that allowed vertebrates to diversify their lifestyles, said co lead author Dr. Humberto Ferron, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bristol. In this context, jawless ancestors, characterized by the presence of heavy rigid headshields, were assumed to be cumbersome fish like creatures, living on the bottom of rivers and seas, with poor maneuverability. Using computational fluid dynamics, Dr. Ferron, University of Bristols Professor Phil Donoghue and their colleagues explored how osteostracans interacted with water currents. The experiments revealed the bizarre spikes and spines that ornamented the heads of these creatures were actually hydrodynamic adaptations, passively generating lift from water currents flowing over the body. The varying head shapes of different species allowed them to adapt to different positions, some high, others low, within the water. They were already ecologically diverse, long before the evolution of their jawed vertebrate relatives. The application of computational fluid dynamics, has allowed us to study the swimming performance of ancient vertebrates and learn more about their position in evolutionary history, said co author Dr. Imran Rahman, a researcher at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Our simulations reveal that the different species of osteostracans show equally different hydrodynamic efficiencies, said co author Dr. Carlos Martinez Perez, a scientist at the University of Valencia. Some of them performed better when moving close to the sea floor or riverbed while others performed better when swimming freely in the water. The different species body shapes are adapted to different environments, revealing distinct lifestyles among these groups of jawless early vertebrates, Professor Donoghue said. Our results call into question the prevailing view that these extinct groups of jawless vertebrates were ecologically constrained, and reveal the main evolutionary hypothesis for the origin of jawed vertebrates is more complex than previously thought.

Dr. Ryan Carney from the University of South Florida and his colleagues analyzed nine attributes of the 150 million year old feather, particularly the long quill, along with data from modern birds. The researchers also examined the 13 known skeletal fossils of Archaeopteryx, three of which contain well preserved primary coverts. They found that the top surface of an Archaeopteryx wing has primary coverts that are identical to the isolated feather in size and shape. The isolated feather was also from the same fossil site as four skeletons of Archaeopteryx, confirming their findings. Theres been debate for the past 159 years as to whether or not this feather belongs to the same species as the Archaeopteryx skeletons, as well as where on the body it came from and its original color, Dr. Carney said. Through scientific detective work that combined new techniques with old fossils and literature, we were able to finally solve these centuries old mysteries. Using a specialized type of electron microscope, the scientists determined that the feather came from the left wing of Archaeopteryx. They also detected melanosomes, which are microscopic pigment structures. After refining their color reconstruction, they found that the feather was entirely matte black. We provide additional insights, such as an updated color reconstruction of the entire feather as matte black, with 90 probability, the authors said. Given the isolated nature of the fossil feather, we can never know the anatomical and taxonomic provenance with 100 certainty. However, based on all available anatomical and taxonomic evidence, independently confirmed by close morphological connections to multiple skeletal specimens, the most empirical and parsimonious conclusion is that the isolated feather represents a primary covert of Archaeopteryx.

Pterosaurs were Earths first winged vertebrates, with birds and bats making their appearances much later. They thrived from about 210 to 65 million years ago, when they were wiped out by the asteroid that also doomed the non avian dinosaurs. It is widely held that pterosaurs were covered with hair like structures called pycnofibers. In 2018, Nanjing University paleontologist Zixiao Yang and colleagues proposed that some pterosaur pycnofibers were branched, exhibiting brush like and tuft like morphologies. Going further, the team compared the branched pycnofibers to protofeathers, previously reported for several dinosaurs, and argued that they share a common origin. Feathered pterosaurs would mean that the very earliest feathers first appeared on an ancestor shared by both pterosaurs and dinosaurs, since it is unlikely that something so complex developed separately in two different groups of animals, Dr. Unwin and Professor Martill said. This would mean that the very first feather like elements evolved at least 80 million years earlier than currently thought. It would also suggest that all dinosaurs started out with feathers, or protofeathers but some groups, such as sauropods, subsequently lost them again  the complete opposite of currently accepted theory. Dr. Unwin and Professor Martill propose that the branched pycnofibers in pterosaurs are not protofeathers at all, but tough fibers which form part of the internal structure of the pterosaurs wing membrane, and that the branching effect may simply be the result of these fibers decaying and unraveling. The idea of feathered pterosaurs goes back to the 19th century but the fossil evidence was then, and still is, very weak, Dr. Unwin said. Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence  we have the former, but not the latter. Either way, paleontologists will have to carefully reappraise ideas about the ecology of these ancient flying reptiles, Professor Martill added. If they really did have feathers, how did that make them look, and did they exhibit the same fantastic variety of colors exhibited by birds. And if they didnt have feathers, then how did they keep warm at night, what limits did this have on their geographic range, did they stay away from colder northern climes as most reptiles do today. And how did they thermoregulate? The clues are so cryptic, that we are still a long way from working out just how these amazing animals worked.

Gravicalymene is a small genus of calymenid trilobites that flourished from the Ordovician to the Devonian period. It includes at least seven species and is relatively well known from the ancient continents of Avalonia, Baltica and Laurentia i.e., Europe and North America. The newly discovered species, named Gravicalymene bakeri, lived during the Late Ordovician epoch, approximately 450 million years ago. During this time, Australia was part of the great landmass Gondwana, when complex marine ecosystems were starting to develop, said Dr. Patrick Smith from the Australian Museum Research Institute and Macquarie University and Dr. Malte Ebach from the University of New South Wales. It was also a time when the first primitive plants were appearing on land. Several specimens of Gravicalymene bakeri were collected from the Late Ordovician shales of the Gordon Group in northern Tasmania. This is the first record of the genus Gravicalymene from the Ordovician of East Gondwana Australasia, the paleontologists said. Gravicalymene bakeri was named after the actor Tom Baker for inspiring the study authors to develop careers in science. Im not old enough to remember Tom Bakers episodes which were originally aired in 1974 81, Dr. Smith said. However, growing up as a teenager when the series re aired in the early 2000s, I followed the show religiously and became convinced that a career in science was guaranteed to improve the world. It was the character of Doctor Who, and especially the actor Tom Baker, that inspired me to explore the natural world, Dr. Ebach added. So, it is a joy to name a trilobite in his honor. My sister in law has even knitted a replica Doctor Who scarf for the occasion. I am delighted to be entitled at last, said Baker, who is based in the UK. I hope the Who World will share my joy. Will I be allowed to tack Fossil on official correspondence? I hope the Who World will celebrate this fresh honor and will spread the news to those who live in remote places. Happy days to all the Who fans everywhere. The discovery is reported in the journal Alcheringa An Australasian Journal of Palaeontology.

The partial skull and skeleton of Gnathomortis stadtmani was discovered in the Mancos Shale of Delta County in western Colorado in 1975. In 1999, the specimen was assigned to the genus Prognathodon and named Prognathodon stadtmani. In a new study, Dr. Joshua Lively from the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin examined the original specimen and the recently uncovered portions of the mosasaurs skull roof, jaw, and braincase. He determined the fossils are not closely related to other species of the genus Prognathodon and needed to be renamed. The new name, Gnathomortis, is derived from Greek and Latin words for jaws of death, Dr. Lively said. It was inspired by the incredibly large jaws of this species, which measure 1.2 m 4 feet in length. An interesting feature of the mosasaurs jaws is a large depression on their outer surface, similar to that seen in modern lizards, such as the collared lizard Crotaphytus collaris. The feature is indicative of large jaw muscles that equipped the marine reptile with a formidable biteforce. What sets this animal apart from other mosasaurs are features of the quadrate  a bone in the jaw joint that also forms a portion of the ear canal, Dr. Lively said. In Gnathomortis, this bone exhibits a suite of characteristics that are transitional from earlier mosasaurs, like Clidastes, and later mosasaurs, like Prognathodon. We now know Gnathomortis swam in the seas of Colorado between 79 and 81 million years ago, or at least 3.5 million years before any species of Prognathodon.

Spinosaurus aegyptiacus is a giant theropod dinosaur that lived about 95 million years ago Cretaceous period in what is now North Africa. This spectacular dinosaur has been interpreted as a fish eating and semi aquatic animal, and more recently shown to have possessed a highly modified tail suited for propelling the animal through water. However, the hypothesis that this dinosaur was semi aquatic  or even perhaps fully aquatic  has met with some opposition, not least because it challenges decade old ideas on dinosaur ecology and evolution. The discovery of hundreds of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus teeth at a new locality near Tarda on the northern margin of the Tafilalt in south eastern Morocco further supports this hypothesis. The huge number of teeth we collected in the prehistoric river bed reveals that Spinosaurus aegyptiacus was there in huge numbers, accounting for 45 of the total dental remains, said University of Portsmouths Professor David Martill, corresponding author of the study. We know of no other location where such a mass of dinosaur teeth have been found in bone bearing rock. The enhanced abundance of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus teeth, relative to other dinosaurs, is a reflection of their aquatic lifestyle. An animal living much of its life in water is much more likely to contribute teeth to the river deposit than those dinosaurs that perhaps only visited the river for drinking and feeding along its banks. From this research, we are able to confirm this location as the place where this gigantic dinosaur not only lived but also died. The results are fully consistent with the idea of a truly water dwelling, river monster. After preparing all the fossils, we then assessed each one in turn, added study co author Aaron Quigley, a Masters student at the University of Portsmouth. The teeth of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus have a distinct surface. They have a smooth round cross section which glints when held up to the light. We sorted all 1,200 teeth into species and then literally counted them all up. 45 of our total find were Spinosaurus aegyptiacus teeth. The Kem Kem river beds are an amazing source of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus remains, added study first author Thomas Beevor, a Masters student at the University of Portsmouth. They also preserve the remains of many other Cretaceous creatures including sawfish, coelacanths, crocodiles, flying reptiles and other land living dinosaurs. With such an abundance of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus teeth, it is highly likely that this animal was living mostly within the river rather than along its banks. The study was published in the journal Cretaceous Research. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Discover New Species of Ornithopod Dinosaur", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Sep 17, 2020", "doc": "A new genus and species of an early ornithopod dinosaur has been identified from two nearly complete skeletons found in Chinas Liaoning Province. The newly discovered dinosaur roamed Earth approximately 123 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous epoch. The ancient creature belongs to Ornithopoda, a large group of mainly herbivorous bird hipped dinosaurs. Scientifically named Changmiania liaoningensis, the new species is the earliest member of the group described so far. Although it superficially resembles Jeholosaurus, represented by numerous specimens in the same deposits, the observed differences suggest that Changmiania liaoningensis occupies a more basal phylogenetic position at the base of the clade Ornithopoda, said Dr. Pascal Godefroit from the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and his colleagues from Argentina and China. The two nearly complete and articulated skeletons of Changmiania liaoningensis were found by local farmers in the Lujiatun Beds of the Yixian Formation close to Lujiatun Village in western Liaoning Province. Both individuals were likely entrapped in a collapsed underground burrow while they were resting, which would explain their perfect lifelike postures and the complete absence of weathering and scavenging traces. The paleontologists hypothesize that the dinosaurs were killed catastrophically by lahar volcanic mudflow from a nearby shield volcano. Such a perfect preservation of the skeleton in a lifelike posture, as observed in both the holotype and referred specimen of Changmiania liaoningensis and also in countless fossils from the Lujiatun Beds, implies that the animals were rapidly entombed while they were still alive, they said. The analysis of the specimens shows that Changmiania liaoningensis was an efficient cursorial adapted to running dinosaur and had adaptations to a fossorial burrowing behavior. Some extant fossorial vertebrates dig with their head to some degree, using the top of their broad, firm heads to move, loosen, or compact soil, the researchers said. The fused premaxillae and the spatulate shape of the dorsal surface of the snout in Changmiania liaoningensis could represent such an implement. Its postcranial skeleton shares a series of morphological characteristics with actual scratch digging mammals, including a shortened neck six cervical vertebrae, a radius that is significantly shorter 70 than the humerus upper arm bone, and short hands, they added. The hip of Changmiania liaoningensis exhibits some features that might also tentatively be related to a digging behavior. Actual mammals that dig with the forefeet usually brace with their hindfeet, often supplemented by the tail serving as a prop. The leg of Changmiania liaoningensis is about twice as long as its hand and its tibia calf bone is significantly longer than its femur thigh bone, as in most other small basal ornithopods except Koreanosaurus, the authors said. Those leg proportions suggest that Changmiania liaoningensis basically remained an efficient cursorial dinosaur. Moreover, the hand and skull modifications remain rather modest, so that Changmiania liaoningensis was obviously not a true subterranean animal, but more likely a facultative digger. The discovery of Changmiania liaoningensis is described in a paper in the journal PeerJ. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Identify New Mass Extinction Event", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Sep 16, 2020", "doc": "The Carnian Pluvial Episode, a major climate change event that occurred around 234 to 232 million years ago Late Triassic epoch, was a time of global environmental changes and possibly substantial volcanism. A new analysis of paleontological data suggests that this event was a major  but previously neglected  time of extinction and may be linked to the disappearance of up to 33 of all marine genera invertebrates, vertebrates, and protists as well as many tetrapod clades and to the explosive diversification of many key modern groups of plants and animals conifers, insects, dinosaurs, crocodiles, lizards, turtles, and mammals. In the research, University of Bristols Dr. Mike Benton, Dr. Jacopo Dal Corso from the China University of Geosciences at Wuhan and their colleagues reviewed all the geological and paleontological evidence and determined what had happened. The cause was most likely massive volcanic eruptions in the Wrangellia Province of western Canada, where huge volumes of volcanic basalt was poured out and forms much of the western coast of North America. The eruptions peaked in the Carnian, Dr. Dal Corso said. I was studying the geochemical signature of the eruptions a few years ago and identified some massive effects on the atmosphere worldwide. The eruptions were so huge, they pumped vast amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, and there were spikes of global warming. The warming was associated with increased rainfall, and this had been detected back in the 1980s by geologists Mike Simms and Alastair Ruffell as a humid episode lasting about one million years in all. The climate change caused major biodiversity loss in the ocean and on land, but just after the extinction event new groups took over, forming more modern like ecosystems. The shifts in climate encouraged growth of plant life, and the expansion of modern conifer forests. The new floras probably provided slim pickings for the surviving herbivorous reptiles, Professor Benton said. We now know that dinosaurs originated some 20 million years before this event, but they remained quite rare and unimportant until the Carnian Pluvial Episode hit. It was the sudden arid conditions after the humid episode that gave dinosaurs their chance. It wasnt just dinosaurs, but also many modern groups of plants and animals also appeared at this time, including some of the first turtles, crocodiles, lizards, and the first mammals. The Carnian Pluvial Episode also had an impact on ocean life. It marks the start of modern style coral reefs, as well as many of the modern groups of plankton, suggesting profound changes in the ocean chemistry and carbonate cycle. So far, paleontologists had identified five big mass extinctions in the past 500 million yeas of the history of life, Dr. Dal Corso said. Each of these had a profound effect on the evolution of the Earth and of life. We have identified another great extinction event, and it evidently had a major role in helping to reset life on land and in the oceans, marking the origins of modern ecosystems.

The new species, named Adelophthalmus pyrrhae, lived about 350 million years ago during the Carboniferous period. It belongs to Eurypterida, a large group of extinct arthropods that thrived from the Ordovician through the Permian period. Their closest living relatives are horseshoe crabs, which lay eggs on land but are unable to breathe above water. The three dimensionally preserved specimen of Adelophthalmus pyrrhae was found 25 years ago in the Lydiennes Formation in Montagne Noire region, France. We wondered if we could apply new technology to look into what was preserved of this specimen, said Dr. James Lamsdell, a researcher in the Department of Geology and Geography at West Virginia University. I like the science and detective work that goes into research. And this was a cold case where we knew there was potential evidence. Using micro computed tomography \u03bc CT imaging technique, Dr. Lamsdell and colleagues studied the respiratory organs of Adelophthalmus pyrrhae. First, they noticed that each gill on the sea scorpion was composed of a series of plates. But the back contained fewer plates than the front, prompting them to question how it could even breathe. Then they zeroed in on trabeculae  pillars connecting the different plates of the gill, which are seen in modern scorpions and spiders. That props the gills apart so they dont collapse when out of water, Dr. Lamsdell said. Its something that modern arachnids still have. Finding that was the final indication. The reason we think they were coming onto land was to move between pools of water. They could also lay eggs in more sheltered, safer environments and migrate back into the open water. The discovery of air breathing structures in Adelophthalmus pyrrhae indicates that terrestrial characteristics occurred in the arachnid stem lineage, suggesting that the ancestor of arachnids were semi terrestrial. The findings were published online this week in the journal Current Biology.

The discovery fills temporal, morphological, and biogeographic gaps in hominoid evolution and provides new evidence about when the ancestors of modern gibbons migrated to Asia from Africa. Named Kapi ramnagarensis, the new primate species lived approximately 12.5 13.8 million years ago Middle Miocene epoch and was distinct from all other known fossil apes. Its complete lower molar was collected in 2015 from the Lower Siwaliks of Ramnagar in Jammu and Kashmir, India. It represents the first new hominoid species discovered at the Ramnagar site in nearly a century and the first new Siwalik ape species in more than three decades. We knew immediately it was a primate tooth, but it did not look like the tooth of any of the primates previously found in the area, said lead author Dr. Christopher Gilbert, a researcher in the Department of Anthropology at Hunter College of the City University of New York and the Division of Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. From the shape and size of the molar, our initial guess was that it might be from a gibbon ancestor, but that seemed too good to be true, given that the fossil record of lesser apes is virtually nonexistent. There are other primate species known during that time, and no gibbon fossils have previously been found anywhere near Ramnagar. So we knew we would have to do our homework to figure out exactly what this little fossil was. Dr. Gilbert and colleagues photographed and CT scanned the specimen and compared it with teeth of living and extinct apes. What we found was quite compelling and undeniably pointed to the close affinities of the 13 million year old tooth with gibbons, said co author Dr. Alejandra Ortiz, a scientist in the Department of Anthropology at New York University and the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. Even if, for now, we only have one tooth, and thus, we need to be cautious, this is a unique discovery. It pushes back the oldest known fossil record of gibbons by at least 5 million years, providing a much needed glimpse into the early stages of their evolutionary history. The age of the fossil is contemporaneous with well known great ape fossils, providing evidence that the migration of great apes, including orangutan ancestors, and lesser apes gibbons and siamangs from Africa to Asia happened around the same time and through the same places. We found the biogeographic component to be really interesting, said co author Dr. Chris Campisano, a researcher in the Institute of Human Origins and the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University. Today, gibbons and orangutans can both be found in Sumatra and Borneo in Southeast Asia, and the oldest fossil apes are from Africa. Knowing that gibbon and orangutan ancestors existed in the same spot together in northern India 13 million years ago, and may have a similar migration history across Asia, is pretty cool. The discovery of Kapi ramnagarensis is reported in a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Theyve examined a partial braincase and skull roof of Minjinia turgenensis and found extensive endochondral bone, the hard bone that makes up our skeleton after birth. This discovery suggests the lighter skeletons of sharks may have evolved from bony ancestors, rather than the other way around. Sharks have skeletons made of cartilage, which is around half the density of bone. Cartilaginous skeletons are known to evolve before bony ones, but it was thought that sharks split from other animals on the evolutionary tree before this happened, keeping their cartilaginous skeletons while other fish, and eventually us, went on to evolve bone. Minjinia turgenensis belongs to a broad group of fish called placoderms, out of which sharks and all other jawed vertebrates  animals with backbones and mobile jaws  evolved. Previously, no placoderm had been found with endochondral bone, but the skull fragments of the ancient fish species were wall to wall endochondral. This could suggest the ancestors of sharks first evolved bone and then lost it again, rather than keeping their initial cartilaginous state for more than 400 million years. It was a very unexpected discovery, said lead author Dr. Martin Brazeau, a researcher in the Department of Life Sciences at Imperial College London and the Department of Earth Sciences at Natural History Museum, London. Conventional wisdom says that a bony inner skeleton was a unique innovation of the lineage that split from the ancestor of sharks more than 400 million years ago, but here is clear evidence of bony inner skeleton in a cousin of both sharks and, ultimately, us.  If sharks had bony skeletons and lost it, it could be an evolutionary adaptation, he added. Sharks dont have swim bladders, which evolved later in bony fish, but a lighter skeleton would have helped them be more mobile in the water and swim at different depths. This may be what helped sharks to be one of the first global fish species, spreading out into oceans around the world 400 million years ago. The study was published online today in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution.

The megalodon Otodus, or Carcharocles, megalodon, the largest shark that ever lived on Earth, ruled the oceans between 23 and 2.6 million years ago, during the Early Miocene to the Pliocene. This prehistoric monster was a top level predator that fed on whales and other marine mammals. It had a cartilaginous skeleton and was therefore poorly preserved with exception of its teeth, but paleontologists believe that it looked a lot like the extant great white shark Carcharodon carcharias, only far larger. University of Bristol researcher Jack Cooper and colleagues used a number of mathematical methods to pin down the size and proportions of the megalodon, by making close comparisons to five ecologically and physiologically similar extant species the great white shark, the shortfin mako shark Isurus oxyrinchus, the longfin mako shark Isurus paucus, the salmon shark Lamna ditropis and the porbeagle Lamna nasus. The megalodon is not a direct ancestor of the great white but is equally related to other macropredatory sharks such as the makos, salmon shark and porbeagle shark, as well as the great white, said corresponding author Dr. Catalina Pimiento, a researcher from Swansea University, the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institution and the Paleontological Institute and Museum at the University of Zurich. We pooled detailed measurements of all five to make predictions about the megalodon. Before we could do anything, we had to test whether these five modern sharks changed proportions as they grew up, said senior author Professor Mike Benton, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol. If, for example, they had been like humans, where babies have big heads and short legs, we would have had some difficulties in projecting the adult proportions for such a huge extinct shark. But we were surprised, and relieved, to discover that in fact that the babies of all these modern predatory sharks start out as little adults, and they dont change in proportion as they get larger. This means we could simply take the growth curves of the five modern forms and project the overall shape as they get larger and larger  right up to a body length of 16 m, added Jack Cooper, a Ph.D. student at Swansea University. The teams results suggest that a 16 m long megalodon likely had a head round 4.65 m long, a dorsal fin approximately 1.62 m tall and a tail around 3.85 m high. This means an adult human could stand on the back of this shark and would be about the same height as the dorsal fin. The reconstruction of the size of megalodon body parts represents a fundamental step towards a better understanding of the physiology of this giant, and the intrinsic factors that may have made it prone to extinction, the researchers said. The study appears in the journal Scientific Reports.

Trace fossils are biologically produced sedimentary structures that include tracks, trails, burrows, borings, fecal pellets, and other traces. Also known as ichnofossils, they represent behavior instead of the preserved remains of specific organisms. Trace fossils are the fossilized evidence of the activities of past life, said Scott Melnyk, a graduate student in the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Alberta. They are very useful to interpret environmental characteristics of Earth millions of years ago. The marine origin of these fossils, for example, provides evidence that the shallow sea that covered much of Western Canada  the Cretaceous Interior Seaway  extended into west central Saskatchewan roughly 100 million years ago. The new trace fossil was found in a core from a wellbore near Bushy Lake, west central Saskatchewan, Canada. Named Apectoichnus lignummasticans, it came from the lagoonal deposits of the Lower Cretaceous Sparky Formation. The fossil is similar in many respects to modern borings in wood that are produced by marine isopods, such as Limnoria lignorum, for feeding and refugia. Apectoichnus lignummasticans is unique in that it is only the third wood boring trace fossil associated with marine environments, Melnyk said. This is only the second time in 20 years that a University of Alberta graduate student has named a new trace fossil, said Professor Murray Gingras, also from the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Alberta. The fossils are similar in many respects to modern borings in wood by marine isopods  this was a remarkable find and a testament to the importance of our students work. The teams paper was published in the Journal of Paleontology.

Their findings suggest that American mastodons repeatedly expanded into northern latitudes in response to interglacial warming. The American mastodon was an iconic part of wooded and swampy habitats in Pleistocene Americas, with remains recovered from the Central American subtropics to the Arctic latitudes of Alaska and Yukon. The species went extinct 11,000 years ago during the megafaunal extinctions that took out many of the large mammals such as mammoths, saber toothed cats and ground sloths. There has been much speculation about what caused their extinction, though many scientists believe it was a combination of climate change, increasing competition for food sources and overhunting by early humans. Dramatic and repeated temperature fluctuations occurred routinely on the planet for millions of years  the most dramatic of which over the last 800,000 years  resulting in ice sheet expansion and retraction and the warming of previously frozen northern regions whose new forests and wetlands provided new food sources for some animals like the mastodon, moose and beaver, but took away grasslands from others like horses, mammoths and bison. The genetic data show a strong signal of migration, moving back and forth across the continent, driven, what appears to be entirely by climate, said senior author Professor Hendrik Poinar, an evolutionary geneticist at McMaster University. These mastodons were living in Alaska at a time when it was warm, as well as Mexico and parts of Central America. These werent stationary populations, the data show there was constant movement back and forth. For the study, Professor Poinar and colleagues teased out and reconstructed DNA from fossilized samples including teeth, tusks and bones. The analysis shows that mastodons were moving vast distances in response to warming climate conditions and melting ice sheets, from warmer environments, to the northernmost reaches of Alaska and the Yukon. However, despite these massive increases in territory, northern populations were much less genetically diverse, rendering them more vulnerable to extinction. By looking genetically at these animals which lived for the last 800,000 years, we can actually see the make up of these populations that made it up to the north, said first author Emil Karpinski, a graduate student at McMaster University. Its really interesting because a lot of species presently, like moose and beaver, are rapidly expanding their range northwards by as much as tens to hundreds of kilometers every century. Analysis of DNA preserved in these fossil mastodon bones gives us so much more information on how these now extinct beasts lived and died in comparison to what we know based on traditional paleontological approaches, said co author Dr. Grant Zazula, a paleontologist with the Government of Yukon. These data hold the key to our understanding of how ancient animal communities like mastodons adapted to changes in the past, and provide clues to how arctic ecosystems will respond to future warming scenarios. The results were published in the journal Nature Communications.

The discovery, described in a paper in the journal eLife, predates modern lichen insect associations by 165 million years, indicating that during the mid Mesozoic Era, the lichen insect mimesis system was well established and provided lacewings with highly honed survival strategies. Many modern insects mimic other organisms or use camouflage to hide from predators. For example, some animals mimic lichens, which are formed from algae and fungus, and grow almost everywhere on Earth, from the Arctic to the desert. The most iconic example of an insect mimicking a species of lichen is the peppered moth. During the industrial revolution, darker colored moths were better at surviving. But when the revolution ended and pollution levels declined, species of lichen began to re emerge and increase the survival of paler moths. Yet, it is unclear how and when insects first evolved this ingenious survival strategy, as distinctive examples of insects mimicking lichens are missing from fossil records. As lichen models are almost absent in the fossil record of mimesis, it is still unclear as to when and how the mimicry association between lichen and insect first arose, said lead author Hui Fang, a Ph.D. student in the College of Life Sciences and Academy for Multidisciplinary Studies at Capital Normal University. The key to answer this question is to find early examples of a lichen like insect and a co occurring lichen fossil. Fang and colleagues discovered deposits at the Daohugou 1 locality of Inner Mongolia in northeastern China that showed the 165 million year old lichen mimesis. The samples involved two species of Lichenipolystoechotes, a newly described genus within the moth lacewing family Ithonidae, resembling the co existing lichen from the Middle Jurassic epoch. The researchers documented this mimetic relationship by describing structural similarities and detailed measurements of the lacewing and lichen. Their results suggest that when the lacewings, named Lichenipolystoechotes ramimaculatus and Lichenipolystoechotes angustimaculatus, rested in a lichen rich habitat, a near perfect match of their appearances would assist the insects concealment from predators. Our findings indicate that a micro ecosystem consisting of lichens and insects existed 165 million years ago in northeastern China, said senior author Dr. Yongjie Wang, also from the College of Life Sciences and Academy for Multidisciplinary Studies at Capital Normal University. This adds to our current understanding of the interactions between insects and their surroundings in the Mesozoic Era, and implies that there are many more interesting insect relationships awaiting discovery.

In a paper in the journal Current Biology, they now describe an almost intact embryonic skull from one of these eggs, which shows that titanosaurian dinosaurs had stereoscopic vision and an unusual elongated horn on the front of the face which was then lost in adulthood. The specimen represents the first 3D preserved embryonic skull of a sauropod sauropodomorph, said lead author Dr. Martin Kundrat, a researcher at Pavol Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik University. The most striking feature is head appearance, which implies that hatchlings of giant dinosaurs may differ in where and how they lived in their earliest stages of life. But because it differs in facial anatomy and size from the sauropod embryos of Auca Mahuevo, Patagonia, we cannot rule out that it may represent a new titanosaurian dinosaur. The preservation of embryonic dinosaurs preserved inside their eggs is extremely rare, said co author Dr. John Nudds, a researcher at the University of Manchester. Imagine the huge sauropods from Jurassic Park and consider that the tiny skulls of their babies, still inside their eggs, are just a couple of centimeters long. Dr. Kundrat, Dr. Nudds and their colleagues used an imaging technology called synchrotron microtomography to study the inner structure of bones, teeth, and soft tissues of the embryonic dinosaur. The scans allowed the scientists to find hidden details, including tiny teeth preserved deeply in tiny jaw sockets. They also found partly calcified elements of the embryonic braincase and what appear to be the remains of temporal muscles. They also reconstructed the most plausible appearance of the skull in titanosaurian sauropods before hatching. Their findings suggest that the baby sauropods may have hatched out of the egg with the help of a thickened prominence rather than a boney egg tooth. The study authors also uncovered evidence that the embryonic dinosaurs used calcium derived from the eggshell long before they were ready to hatch. They found that the titanosaurian hatchlings emerged with a temporary moncerotid single horned face, retracted openings on the nose nares and early binocular vision. We suggest an alternative head appearance for babies of these Patagonian giants, Dr. Kundrat said. We were able to reconstruct the embryonic skull prior to hatching, Dr. Nudds said. The embryos possessed a specialized craniofacial anatomy that precedes the post natal transformation of the skull in adult sauropods. Part of the skull of these embryonic sauropods was extended into an elongated snout or horn, so that they possessed a peculiarly shaped face.

The discovery was enabled by high resolution of incremental growth marks preserved in the fossilized tusks of Lystrosaurus from Antarctica. Lystrosaurus is a type of dicynodont, a major group of primarily herbivorous vertebrates that were common during the Permian and Triassic periods. The ancient creature was between 1.8 and 2.4 meter 6 8 feet in length, had no teeth, but bore a pair of tusks in the upper jaw. The fossilized remains of Lystrosaurus are known from China, Europe, India, South Africa and Antarctica and this geographic distribution was one of the early pieces of evidence used in support of the large supercontinent Pangea. The animals fossils have been found in burrow structures in South Africa and similar burrow trace fossils have been recovered from Antarctica, but not with Lystrosaurus inside them. Lystrosaurus arose before Earths largest mass extinction at the end of the Permian period  which wiped out 70 of vertebrate species on land  and somehow survived. The fact that Lystrosaurus survived the end Permian mass extinction and had such a wide range in the early Triassic has made them a very well studied group of animals for understanding survival and adaptation, said Burke Museums Professor Christian Sidor, co author of the study. The Lystrosaurus fossils from the Fremouw Formation of Antarctica are the oldest evidence of a hibernation like state in a vertebrate animal and indicate that torpor  a general term for hibernation and similar states in which animals temporarily lower their metabolic rate to get through a tough season  arose in vertebrates even before mammals and dinosaurs evolved. Animals that live at or near the poles have always had to cope with the more extreme environments present there, said lead author Dr. Megan Whitney, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University. These preliminary findings indicate that entering into a hibernation like state is not a relatively new type of adaptation. It is an ancient one. The Lystrosaurus tusks made the study possible because, like elephants, their tusks grew continuously throughout their lives. Taking cross sections of the fossilized tusks revealed information about the animals metabolism, growth and stress or strain. The paleontologists compared cross sections of tusks from six Antarctic Lystrosaurus to cross sections of four Lystrosaurus from South Africa. The tusks from the two regions showed similar growth patterns, with layers of dentine deposited in concentric circles like tree rings. The Antarctic fossils, however, held an additional feature that was rare or absent in tusks farther north closely spaced, thick rings, which likely indicate periods of less deposition due to prolonged stress. The closest analog we can find to the stress marks that we observed in Antarctic Lystrosaurus tusks are stress marks in teeth associated with hibernation in certain modern animals, Dr. Whitney said. The researchers cannot definitively conclude that Lystrosaurus underwent true hibernation. The stress could have been caused by another hibernation like form of torpor, such as a more short term reduction in metabolism. Lystrosaurus in Antarctica likely needed some form of hibernation like adaptation to cope with life near the South Pole, Dr. Whitney said.

Scelidosaurus harrisonii is an early armored ornithischian dinosaur whose remains have, to date, only been recovered from a paleontological site on the south coast of Dorset, England. This dinosaur has been known since 1859, but only on the basis of a partial description found in two short articles published in the early 1860s by Richard Owen from the British Museum in London. The original material, discovered in 1858, comprised the majority of the skull and its associated postcranial skeleton, and represents the first ever, more or less complete dinosaur discovered. Over the past three years, University of Cambridge paleontologist David Norman has devoted much of his time to preparing a detailed description and biological analysis of Scelidosaurus harrisonii, completing a project more than 150 years in the making. Scelidosaurus harrisonii represents a species that appeared at, or close to, the evolutionary birth of the Ornithischia, Dr. Norman said. Given that context, what was actually known of Scelidosaurus harrisonii? The answer remarkably little Nobody knew that the skull had horns on its back edge. It also had several bones that have never before been recognized in any other dinosaur, he added. It is also clear from the rough texturing of the skull bones that it was, in life, covered by hardened horny scutes  a little bit like the scutes plastered over the surface of the skulls of living turtles. Its entire body was protected by skin that anchored an array of stud like bony spikes and plates. Scelidosaurus harrisonii had been seen for many decades as an early member of the group that included the stegosaurs and ankylosaurs, but that was based on a poor understanding of its anatomy. Now it seems that Scelidosaurus harrisonii is an ancestor of the ankylosaurs alone. It is unfortunate that such an important dinosaur, discovered at such a critical time in the early study of dinosaurs, was never properly described, Dr. Norman said. It has now been described in detail and provides many new and unexpected insights concerning the biology of early dinosaurs and their underlying relationships. The results were published in a series of four papers in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society of London.  David B. Norman. 2020.

Following the extinction of non avian dinosaurs, the largest continental predator was neither a mammal nor a bird, but the giant caiman Purussaurus. This carnivorous animal inhabited South America during the middle and late Miocene, when a system of wetlands flourished in northwestern Amazonia. Purussaurus exceeded 10 m 33 feet long and had a broad, massive skull and robust jaws with conical and blunt teeth. In October 2004, Dr. Fran\u00e7ois Pujos of the Instituto Argentino de Nivolog\u00eda and colleagues discovered Miocene epoch bonebeds near Iquitos City in Peru. One bonebed preserved swamp deposits bearing diverse aquatic and land dwelling vertebrate assemblages, particularly rich in fish, turtle, reptile and mammal remains. Among the fossils, the paleontologists found a 13 million years old severely damaged long bone of a massive mammal. The teams preliminary examination of the specimen revealed 46 tooth marks that were inflicted prior to fossilization. In a new study, Dr. Pujos and his colleague, Dr. Rodolfo Salas Gismondi from the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, aimed to identify the putative perpetrator of the attack and its victim. They found that the bone belonged to Pseudoprepotherium, a middle sized ground sloth body weight  78.5 kg, equivalent to a large capybara that lived in Colombia, Brazil and Venezuela during the Miocene. The combination of round and bisected, shallow pits and large punctures that collapsed extensive portions of cortical bone points to a young or sub adult Purussaurus neivensis\u00a0approximately 4 m, or 13.1 feet, in total length as the perpetrator, the researchers said. The pattern of tooth marks suggests that the perpetrator attacked and captured the ground sloth from the lower hind limb, yet an attempt of dismembering cannot be ruled out. This discovery from the Peruvian Amazonia provides an unusual snapshot of the dietary preferences of Purussaurus, they added. It also reveals that prior to reaching its giant size, young individuals might have fed upon terrestrial mammals of about the size of a capybara.

The work could be the oldest direct evidence that Triassic marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs  previously thought to be cephalopod feeders  were apex megapredators. The ichthyosaurs were a group of marine reptiles that appeared in the oceans after the Permian mass extinction, about 250 million years ago. They had fish like bodies similar to modern tuna, but breathed air like dolphins and whales. Like modern orca or great white sharks, they may have been apex predators of their ecosystems, but until recently there has been little direct evidence of this. The new specimen of the ichthyosaur Guizhouichthyosaurus was discovered in Guizhou province, China, in 2010. We have never found articulated remains of a large reptile in the stomach of gigantic predators from the age of dinosaurs, such as marine reptiles and dinosaurs, said University of California, Davis Professor Ryosuke Motani, co lead author of the study. We always guessed from tooth shape and jaw design that these predators must have fed on large prey but now we have direct evidence that they did. Guizhouichthyosaurus was almost 5 m long, while its prey was about 4 m long, although thalattosaurs had skinnier bodies than ichythyosaurs. The new specimen represents the oldest direct record of megafaunal predation by marine tetrapods and also sets the record for the largest prey size of Mesozoic marine reptiles at 4 m, which is larger than the previous record of 2.5 m 8.2 feet. Our ichthyosaurs stomach contents werent etched by stomach acid, so it must have died quite soon after ingesting this food item, Professor Motani said. At first, we just didnt believe it, but after spending several years visiting the dig site and looking at the same specimens, we finally were able to swallow what we were seeing. We now have a really solid articulated fossil in the stomach of a marine reptile for the first time, he added. Before, we guessed that they must have eaten these big things, but now, we can say for sure that they did eat large animals. This also suggests that megapredation was probably more common than we previously thought. Guizhouichthyosaurus last meal appears to be the middle section of Xinpusaurus xingyiensis, from its front to back limbs. The predator has grasping teeth yet swallowed the body trunk in one to several pieces. Predators that feed on large animals are often assumed to have large teeth adapted for slicing up prey, the paleontologists said. Guizhouichthyosaurus had relatively small, peg like teeth, which were thought to be adapted for grasping soft prey such as the squid like animals abundant in the oceans at the time. Interestingly, a fossil of what appears to be the tail section of Xinpusaurus xingyiensis was found nearby. Its clear that you dont need slicing teeth to be a megapredator, Professor Motani said. Guizhouichthyosaurus probably used its teeth to grip the prey, perhaps breaking the spine with the force of its bite, then ripped or tore the prey apart. Modern apex predators such as orca, leopard seals and crocodiles use a similar strategy. While the scientists now know that Guizhouichthyosaurus could eat animals as large as the thalattosaur, they dont know if it killed this individual, or simply scavenged it. Nobody was there filming it, Professor Motani said. However, there is reason to believe this was not a case of scavenging modern marine decomposition studies suggest that if left to decay, the thalattosaurs limbs would disintegrate and detach before the tail. Instead, we found the opposite in these fossils. The teams paper was published this month in the journal iScience.

The largest terrestrial dinosaurs were enormous creatures whose body mass placed massive gravitational loads on their skeleton. Previous studies investigated dinosaurian bone strength and biomechanics, but the relationships between their trabecular bone architecture and mechanical behavior had not been studied until now. The structure of the trabecula, or spongy bone that forms in the interior of bones we studied is unique within dinosaurs, said study co author Dr. Tony Fiorillo, a paleontologist in the Huffington Department of Earth Sciences at Southern Methodist University. The trabecular bone tissue surrounds the tiny spaces or holes in the interior part of the bone such as what you might see in a ham or steak bone. Unlike in mammals and birds, the trabecular bone does not increase in thickness as the body size of dinosaurs increase. Instead it increases in density of the occurrence of spongy bone. Without this weight saving adaptation, the skeletal structure needed to support the hadrosaurs would be so heavy, the dinosaurs would have had great difficulty moving. Dr. Fiorillo and colleagues used engineering failure theories and allometry scaling to analyze CT scans of the distal femur and proximal tibia of several dinosaur species a troodontid, a caenagnathid, an ornithomimid, a therizinosaur, and two hadrosaurs Edmontosaurus annectens and Edmontosaurus regalis. Our team is the first to use these tools to better understand the bone structure of extinct species and the first to assess the relationship between bone architecture and movement in dinosaurs, they said. The researchers then compared their findings to scans to extinct and living mammals, such as the Java mouse deer, the domestic sheep, the Siberian tiger, the white rhinoceros, the Asian elephant and the Columbian mammoth. Understanding the mechanics of the trabecular architecture of dinosaurs may help us better understand the design of other light weight and dense structures, said study lead author Dr. Trevor Aguirre, a researcher in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Colorado State University. The findings were published in the journal PLoS ONE.

Devonian Carboniferous boundary rock samples contain malformed plant spores that appear to be sunburnt by ultraviolet light  evidence of a long lasting ozone depletion event. Earth based catastrophes such as large scale volcanism and global warming can destroy the ozone layer, too, but evidence for those is inconclusive for the time interval in question, said Professor Brian Fields, a researcher in the Department of Ecology  Evolutionary Biology and the Biodiversity Institute at the University of Kansas. Instead, we propose that one or more supernova explosions, about 65 light years away from Earth, could have been responsible for the protracted loss of ozone. Professor Fields and colleagues explored several astrophysical causes for this ozone depletion, such as meteorite impacts, solar eruptions and gamma ray bursts. But these events end quickly and are unlikely to cause the long lasting ozone depletion that happened at the end of the Devonian period, said Jesse Miller, a graduate student in the Illinois Center for Advanced Studies of the Universe and the Department of Astronomy at the University of Illinois. A supernova, on the other hand, delivers a one two punch it immediately bathes Earth with damaging UV, X rays and gamma rays later, supernova debris slams into the Solar System, subjecting the planet to long lived irradiation from cosmic rays accelerated by the supernova. The damage to Earth and its ozone layer can last for up to 100,000 years. However, fossil evidence indicates a 300,000 year decline in biodiversity leading up to the Devonian Carboniferous mass extinction, suggesting the possibility of multiple catastrophes, maybe even multiple supernova explosions. This is entirely possible. Massive stars usually occur in clusters with other massive stars, and other supernovae are likely to occur soon after the first explosion, Miller said. The key to proving that a supernova occurred would be to find the radioactive isotopes plutonium 244 and samarium 146 in the rocks and fossils deposited at the time of extinction. Neither of these isotopes occurs naturally on Earth today, and the only way they can get here is via cosmic explosions, said Zhenghai Liu, an undergraduate student in the Illinois Center for Advanced Studies of the Universe and the Department of Astronomy at the University of Illinois. Plutonium 244 and samarium 146 decay over time, Professor Fields said. So if we find these radioisotopes on Earth today, we know they are fresh and not from and thus the smoking guns of a nearby supernova. The scientists have yet to search for plutonium 244 and samarium 146 in Devonian Carboniferous boundary rocks. The overarching message of our study is that life on Earth does not exist in isolation, Professor Fields said. We are citizens of a larger cosmos, and the cosmos intervenes in our lives  often imperceptibly, but sometimes ferociously.

Crested penguins are members of Eudyptes, the most diverse genus among living penguins. Today the New Zealand region is home to four breeding species of this genus, including three endemics. Named Eudyptes atatu, the newly identified species was closest in size to the modern erect crested penguin Eudyptes sclateri. It had a markedly more slender upper beak and jaw compared with other crested penguins. The skull of Eudyptes atatu is more gracile than that of any living crested penguin species, with a more slender, gently hooked beak lacking the strong swelling of the beak tip rostral to the nares characteristic of living crested penguins, said Massey University ornithologist Dr. Daniel Thomas and colleagues. The most striking difference between Eudyptes atatu and living crested penguins is the shape of the jaw. Whereas the jaw of modern crested penguin species shows a pronounced deepening towards the midpoint, in Eudyptes atatu the jaw retains a more slender shape. The discovery of Eudyptes atatu also shows that the deep bill of crested penguins evolved comparatively recently, most likely in the past 2 5 million years. Our combined evidence approach reveals that deep bills evolved in both crested and stiff tailed penguins Pygoscelis during the Pliocene, the researchers said. That deep bills arose so late in the greater than 60 million year evolutionary history of penguins suggests that dietary shifts may have occurred as wind driven Pliocene upwelling radically restructured southern ocean ecosystems. The various fossilized remains of the ancient species were collected from the Tangahoe Formation in the southern Taranaki region of the North Island of New Zealand. Eudyptes atatu provides an important new window into the evolution and paleobiology of crown penguins and reinforces the importance of Zealandia for seabird evolution, the scientists concluded. The rapidly improving fossil record of both early stem penguins and Pliocene Holocene stem penguins suggests that Zealandia was an incubator of penguin diversity in which the first penguins, the first crown penguins, and likely the first crested penguins evolved and later dispersed throughout the southern hemisphere.

The scientists have also confirmed that the cave lion and the extant lion Panthera leo are distinct species. The cave lion was an apex predator widespread across the Holarctic until their extinction at the end of the Pleistocene period. It was larger than its modern counterpart, and Pleistocene cave art suggests that it did not have a mane. However, it may have shared several behavioral traits with the lion, such as group living and courtship rituals. The timing of the divergence between the extinct cave lion and the extant lion is controversial. The cave lion was one of the most common large predators during the last Ice Age, with a distribution throughout northern Eurasia and North America. It became extinct about 14,000 years ago, said Professor Love Dal\u00e9n, an evolutionary geneticist at the Centre for Palaeogenetics. Cave lions painted in the Chauvet Cave, France. In the study, Professor Dal\u00e9n and colleagues investigated mitochondrial genome diversity in 31 cave lions, including a well preserved cave lion cub named Spartak, from across their entire prehistoric range. Spartak had been frozen for 28,000 years before it was discovered and is probably the best preserved Ice Age animal ever found, they said. They identified two deeply diverged subspecies and an additional third distinct lineage represented by a single individual. One of these subspecies lived in Beringia Yakutia, Alaska and Yukon Territory while the other was prevalent across western Eurasia. This geographical distribution is consistent with previous findings that cave lion skulls and jaws from Beringia are significantly smaller than those from Europe. In addition, it is likely that Beringian and European cave lions had different prey preferences, with the former focusing on bison and horses, and the latter on reindeer. The results also show that cave lions diverged from present day lions about 1.85 million years ago and subsequently split into two different subspecies roughly 500,000 years ago. Our study suggests that the cave lion was indeed a distinct species, separated from the modern lion, said Dr. David Stanton, a researcher in the Centre for Palaeogenetics and the Department of Bioinformatics and Genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural History. The analyses also support the theory that the cave lion was divided into an eastern and a western subspecies. The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Trilobites are extinct marine arthropods that dominated the ecosystems of the Paleozoic era 542 251 million years ago. From the very beginning of their appearance they were equipped with compound eyes, which during the Cambrian explosion and later differentiated into highly diverse visual systems. The most basic type, and still very common among diurnal insects and crustaceans, is the apposition compound eye. It consists of up to 30,000 individual, more or less identical receptor units, so called ommatidia, optically isolated from each other by a set of screening pigment cells. In a new study, University of Colognes Dr. Brigitte Schoenemann and Dr. Euan Clarkson from the University of Edinburgh used digital microscopy to examine apposition compound eyes of a small trilobite called Aulacopleura koninckii. This extinct species was first described in 1846 by the French Czech paleontologist Joachim Barrande, a pioneer of trilobite research, from specimens collected at several paleontological sites near Lod\u011bnice in the Czech Republic. The excellently preserved specimen studied by the study authors is 1 2 mm high and has two protruding semi oval eyes on the back of its head, one of which has broken off. They identified a number of internal structures that are similar to those of the compound eyes of many modern insects and crustaceans, including their ommatidia measuring 35 \u03bcm in diameter that contain eight light detecting cells grouped around a transparent tube called a rhabdom. Each visual unit is topped with a thick lens and the remains of what the paleontologists suggest is a flat crystalline cone that light passed through before being focused onto the rhabdom. The small size of its visual units indicates that Aulacopleura koninckii lived in bright, shallow waters and was probably active during the day, as smaller diameter lenses are efficient at capturing light under bright conditions. The presence of pigment cell barriers between visual units suggests that the trilobite had mosaic vision with each visual unit contributing a small portion of the overall image, similar to the compound eyes of many modern insects and crustaceans. The researchers also think that Aulacopleura koninckii likely was a translucent trilobite, comparable to modern shrimps and other smaller aquatic crustaceans with translucent shells, providing an excellent camouflage in water. This 429 million year old trilobite already possessed a modern type of compound eye, and it is shown that the principles of vision in modern honeybee or dragonflies, as many crustaceans, is almost half a billion years old, they said. Its excellent preservation expressly underlines the relevance and potentials of insights into the fossil record in understanding the evolution to functional principles to modern sensory systems of today.

The woolly rhinoceros was a cold adapted megaherbivore widely distributed across northern Eurasia during the Late Pleistocene epoch. This species first appeared some 350,000 years ago and became extinct approximately 14,000 years ago. The woolly rhinoceros fossils are fairly common and have been discovered throughout Europe and Asia. Well preserved remains have been found frozen in ice and buried in oil saturated soils. In Ukraine, a complete carcass of a female woolly rhinoceros was discovered buried in the mud. The combination of oil and salt prevented the remains from decomposing, allowing the soft tissues to remain intact. While humans and climate change have been proposed as potential causes of its extinctions, knowledge is limited on how this ancient creature was impacted by human arrival and climatic fluctuations. It was initially thought that humans appeared in northeastern Siberia 14,000 15,000 years ago, around when the woolly rhinoceros went extinct, said Professor Love Dal\u00e9n, a researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics, a joint venture between Stockholm University and the Swedish Museum of Natural History. But recently, there have been several discoveries of much older human occupation sites, the most famous of which is around thirty thousand years old. So, the decline towards extinction of the woolly rhinoceros doesnt coincide so much with the first appearance of humans in the region. If anything, we actually see something looking a bit like an increase in population size during this period. To investigate the demographic history of the woolly rhinoceros leading up to its extinction, Professor Dal\u00e9n and colleagues studied DNA from tissue, bone, and hair samples of 14 individuals. We sequenced a complete nuclear genome to look back in time and estimate population sizes, and we also sequenced fourteen mitochondrial genomes to estimate the female effective population sizes, said Edana Lord, a Ph.D. student at the Centre for Palaeogenetics. By looking at the heterozygosity, or genetic diversity, of these genomes, the researchers were able to estimate the woolly rhino populations for tens of thousands of years before their extinction. We examined changes in population size and estimated inbreeding, said Dr. Nicolas Dussex, a postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics. We found that after an increase in population size at the start of a cold period some 29,000 years ago, the woolly rhino population size remained constant and that at this time, inbreeding was low. This stability lasted until well after humans began living in Siberia, contrasting the declines that would be expected if the woolly rhinos went extinct due to hunting. Thats the interesting thing. We actually dont see a decrease in population size after 29,000 years ago, Lord said. The data we looked at only goes up to 18,500 years ago, which is approximately 4,500 years before their extinction, so it implies that they declined sometime in that gap. The DNA data also revealed genetic mutations that helped the woolly rhinoceros adapt to colder weather. One of these mutations, a type of receptor in the skin for sensing warm and cold temperatures, has also been found in woolly mammoths. Adaptations like this suggest the woolly rhinoceros, which was particularly suited to the frigid northeast Siberian climate, may have declined due to the heat of a brief warming period, known as the B\u00f8lling Aller\u00f8d interstadial, that coincided with their extinction towards the end of the last Ice Age. Were coming away from the idea of humans taking over everything as soon as they come into an environment, and instead elucidating the role of climate in megafaunal extinctions, Lord said. Although we cant rule out human involvement, we suggest that the woolly rhinoceros extinction was more likely related to climate. The results were published in the journal Current Biology.

The newly discovered dinosaur roamed the Earth approximately 115 million years ago Cretaceous period. It belongs to Tetanurae, a group that includes most theropod dinosaurs, including megalosauroids, allosauroids, tyrannosauroids, ornithomimosaurs, maniraptorans, and birds. Named Vectaerovenator inopinatus, the ancient creature is estimated to have been up to 4 m 13.1 feet long. The fossilized bones from the neck, back and tail of the new dinosaur were found over a period of weeks in 2019 in three separate discoveries, two by individuals and one by a family group, on the foreshore near Knock Cliff on the Isle of Wight. The joy of finding the bones we discovered was absolutely fantastic. I thought they were special and so took them along when we visited Dinosaur Isle Museum, said Robin Ward, a fossil hunter who was with his family visiting the Isle of Wight when they made their discovery. They immediately knew these were something rare and asked if we could donate them to the museum to be fully researched. It looked different from marine reptile vertebrae I have come across in the past, said regular fossil hunter James Lockyer. I was walking along the beach, kicking stones and came across what looked like a bone from a dinosaur, added regular fossil hunter Paul Farrell. I was really shocked to find out it could be a new species. Vectaerovenator inopinatus had large air spaces in some of the bones, one of the traits that helped the paleontologists identify its theropod origins. These air sacs, also seen in modern birds, were extensions of the lung, and it is likely they helped fuel an efficient breathing system while also making the skeleton lighter. We were struck by just how hollow this animal was  its riddled with air spaces. Parts of its skeleton must have been rather delicate, said lead author Chris Barker, a Ph.D. student at the University of Southampton. The record of theropod dinosaurs from the mid Cretaceous period in Europe isnt that great, so its been really exciting to be able to increase our understanding of the diversity of dinosaur species from this time. It is likely that Vectaerovenator inopinatus lived in an area just north of where its remains were found, with the carcass having washed out into the shallow sea nearby.

They gnawed trees with rounded front teeth, not squared teeth like their modern relatives. A team of paleontologists from Canada, the United States and the UK says their woodcutting behavior originated for harvesting food, not from a compulsion for building dams. Modern beavers are prolific ecosystem engineers and dramatically alter the landscape. They harvest trees and shrubs for sustenance, particularly during the winter, but also for the purpose of lodge and dam building. However, little is known about the evolutionary drivers of their woodcutting behavior. Ancient animals and ecosystems that thrived in the high Arctic during warmer times in geological history show us a glimpse of what this biome could look like in the future under the effects of global warming in polar regions, said lead author Tessa Plint, a former Western University graduate student currently pursuing a PhD at Heriot Watt University. Today, the beaver has a profound impact on the landscape and is known to increase the biodiversity of the local ecosystem through tree harvesting and dam building. Its fascinating to look back in time and figure out how this hyper specialized toolkit of behaviors came to be. To reconstruct the paleodiet of ancient beavers, Plint and her colleagues from the University of Western Ontario, the University of Montana, Paleotec Services, Canadian Museum of Nature and Carleton University examined carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures preserved fossilized plants and Dipoides beaver bones from the Beaver Pond site on Ellesmere Island. The results indicate a diet of woody and aquatic plants, supporting the hypothesis that these extinct beavers engaged in woodcutting behavior for feeding purposes. According to the team, woodcutting and consumption of woody plants can be traced back to a small bodied, semi aquatic beaver from the Miocene epoch, suggesting that beavers have been consuming woody plants for over 20 million years. The chemical signatures preserved in the Dipoides bones and plant remains also provided an excellent record of past ecological and climatic conditions. From these findings, we can begin to understand the potential impacts of current climate and environmental change on Earth, and anticipate  for example  who survives and who doesnt, said co author Dr. Fred Longstaffe, a researcher in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Western Ontario. The more we unearth this time capsule from Ellesmere Island, the more we discover a boreal forest type landscape, added co author Dr. Ashley Ballantyne, a bioclimatologist at the University of Montana. It is yet another glimpse into what the Arctic looked like during a much warmer time in Earths history. This study highlights how beavers have been impacting forest and freshwater ecosystems for millions of years, and helps us understand the evolution of their role as ecosystem engineers, Plint said. The findings appear in the journal Scientific Reports.

Named Deinosuchus schwimmeri, it lived between 75 and 82 million years ago Cretaceous period and had teeth the size of bananas, capable to take down even the very largest of dinosaurs. Deinosuchus is a genus of giant over 10 m, or 33 feet, in length crocodylians from the Late Cretaceous of North America. These creatures were the largest semiaquatic predators in their environments, longer and heavier than their predatory competitors, and are known to have fed on large vertebrates, including contemporaneous dinosaurs. Two Deinosuchus species, Deinosuchus hatcheri and Deinosuchus riograndensis, lived in the west of America, ranging from Montana to northern Mexico. The newly described species, Deinosuchus schwimmeri, lived along the Atlantic coastal plain from New Jersey to Mississippi. Deinosuchus was a giant that must have terrorized dinosaurs that came to the waters edge to drink, said Dr. Adam Cossette, a researcher in the Department of Basic Sciences at the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine at Arkansas State University and the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Iowa. Dr. Cossette and his colleague, University of Iowas Professor Christopher Brochu, studied new and previously found material to review species level systematics of Deinosuchus and help refine its phylogenetic placement among crocodilians. Until now, the complete animal was unknown. The new specimens weve examined reveal a bizarre, monstrous predator with teeth the size of bananas, Dr. Cossette said. Based on its enormous skull, Deinosuchus looked like neither an alligator nor a crocodile. Its snout was long and broad, but inflated at the front around the nose in a way not seen in any other crocodylian, living or extinct. The reason for such enlarged nose is unknown. It was a strange animal, Professor Brochu said. It shows that crocodylians are not living fossils that havent changed since the age of dinosaurs. Theyve evolved just as dynamically as any other group. It had two large holes are present at the tip of the snout in front of the nose, Dr. Cossette added. These holes are unique to Deinosuchus and we do not know what they were for, further research down the line will hopefully help us unpick this mystery and we can learn further about this incredible creature. Deinosuchus seems to have been an opportunistic predator, and given that it was so enormous, almost everything in its habitat was on the menu, said Dr. Stephanie Drumheller Horto, a paleontologist at the University of Tennessee who was not involved in the current study. We actually have multiple examples of bite marks made by Deinosuchus riograndensis and a species described in this study, Deinosuchus schwimmeri, on turtle shells and dinosaur bones.

One of the most remarkable Triassic reptiles, Tanystropheus is characterized by an extraordinarily long and stiffened neck that is almost three times the length of its torso, despite being composed of only 13 hyper elongated vertebrae. It was first described as a single species, Tanystropheus longobardicus, in 1852, and its been puzzling paleontologists ever since. For a long time, scientists werent sure whether this reptile lived on land or in the water. Its bizarre body didnt make things clear one way or the other. Tanystropheus looked like a stubby crocodile with a very, very long neck, said Dr. Olivier Rieppel, a paleontologist at the Field Museum. In the same region where many of the big Tanystropheus fossils were found, in whats now Switzerland, there were also fossils from similar looking reptiles that were only about 1.2 m 4 feet long. So not only were scientists unsure if these were land dwellers or marine animals, but they also didnt know if the smaller specimens were juveniles or even a separate species. To solve these two long standing mysteries, Dr. Rieppel and colleagues used newer technologies to see details of the animals bones. The large Tanystropheus fossils skulls had been crushed, but the researchers were able to take CT scans of the fossil slabs and generate 3D images of the bone fragments inside. The skulls had key features, including nostrils on top of the snout like a crocodiles, that suggested Tanystropheus lived in the water. It probably lay in wait, waiting for fish and squid like animals to swim by, and then snagged them with its long, curved teeth. It may have come to land to lay eggs, but overall, it stayed in the ocean. That neck doesnt make sense in a terrestrial environment. Its just an awkward structure to carry around, Dr. Rieppel said. To learn whether the small specimens were juveniles or a separate species, the scientists examined the bones for signs of growth and aging. We looked at cross sections of bones from the small type and were very excited to find many growth rings. This tells us that these animals were mature, said Dr. Torsten Scheyer, a paleontologist at the University of Zurich. The authors named the larger species Tanystropheus hydroides. The small form bears the original name Tanystropheus longobardicus. The small species likely fed on small shelled animals, like shrimp, in contrast to the large species which ate fish and squid, said Dr. Stephan Spiekman, a paleontologist at the University of Zurich. We expected the bizarre neck of Tanystropheus to be specialized for a single task, like the neck of a giraffe. But actually, it allowed for several lifestyles. For many years now we have had our suspicions that there were two species of Tanystropheus, but until we were able to CT scan the larger specimens we had no definitive evidence. Now we do, said Dr. Nick Fraser, keeper of natural sciences at National Museums Scotland. It is hugely significant to discover that there were two quite separate species of this bizarrely long necked reptile who swam and lived alongside each other in the coastal waters of the great sea of Tethys approximately 240 million years ago.

The ancient encounter presents some of the first direct evidence showing how the newly identified hell ant species, Ceratomyrmex ellenbergeri, and other hell ants once used their killer features  snapping their bizarre, but deadly, scythe like mandibles in a vertical motion to pin prey against their horn like appendages. The study was published in the journal Current Biology. Fossilized behavior is exceedingly rare, predation especially so, said lead author Dr. Phillip Barden, a researcher in the Department of Biological Sciences at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and the Division of Invertebrate Zoology at the American Museum of Natural History. As paleontologists, we speculate about the function of ancient adaptations using available evidence, but to see an extinct predator caught in the act of capturing its prey is invaluable. This fossilized predation confirms our hypothesis for how hell ant mouthparts worked. The only way for prey to be captured in such an arrangement is for the ant mouthparts to move up and downward in a direction unlike that of all living ants and nearly all insects. The hell ant lineage, along with their striking predatory traits, are suspected to have vanished along with many other early ant groups during periods of ecological change around the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event 65 million years ago. Since the first hell ant was unearthed about a hundred years ago, its been a mystery as to why these extinct animals are so distinct from the ants we have today, Dr. Barden said. This fossil reveals the mechanism behind what we might call an evolutionary experiment, and although we see numerous such experiments in the fossil record, we often dont have a clear picture of the evolutionary pathway that led to them. Dr. Barden and colleagues suggest that adaptations for prey capture likely explain the rich diversity of mandibles and horns observed in the 16 species of hell ants identified to date. Some species with unarmed, elongate horns such as Ceratomyrmex ellenbergeri apparently grasped prey externally, while other hell ants such as the recently discovered Linguamyrmex vladi were thought to have used a metal reinforced horn on its head to impale prey  a trait potentially used to feed on the internal liquid hemolymph of insects. The earliest hell ant ancestors would have first gained the ability to move their mouthparts vertically, Dr. Barden said. This, in turn, would functionally integrate the mouthparts and head in a way that was unique to this extinct lineage. Integration is a powerful shaping force in evolutionary biology  when anatomical parts function together for the first time, this opens up new evolutionary trajectories as the two features evolve in concert, he said. The consequences of this innovation in mouthpart movement with the hell ants are remarkable. While no modern ants have horns of any kind, some species of hell ant possess horns coated with serrated teeth, and others like Linguamyrmex vladi are suspected to have reinforced its horn with metal to prevent its own bite from impaling itself. To explore further, the researchers compared the head and mouthpart morphology of Ceratomyrmex ellenbergeri and several other hell ant species such as head, horn and mandible size with similar datasets of living and fossil ant species. They also conducted a phylogenetic analysis to reconstruct evolutionary relationships among both Cretaceous and modern ants. Their analyses confirmed that hell ants belong to one of the earliest branches of the ant evolutionary tree and are each others closest relatives. Moreover, the relationship between mandible and head morphology is unique in hell ants compared to living lineages as a result of their specialized prey capture behavior. The analyses also demonstrated that elongated horns evolved twice in hell ants. While the fossil has finally provided the scientists with firmer answers as to how this long lost class of ant predators functioned and found success for nearly 20 million years, questions persist such as what led these and other lineages to go extinct while modern ants flourished into the ubiquitous insects we know today.

The new piece of amber was found at the Angbamo site in Tanai township of Myanmars Kachin state. The specimen measures 12.7 x 8.8 x 4.5 cm 5 x 3.5 x 1.8 inches and weighs 284 g, and is the ninth reported Burmese amber specimen with bird skeletal remains. It preserves the portions of two wings with feathers and two feet all belonging to the same individual making it one of the relatively more complete specimens known so far. The specimen preserves the distal portions of both wings and feet, although most of the skeletal elements are poorly preserved due to various degrees of dissolution and decay, said Dr. Lida Xing from the China University of Geosciences and the Yingliang Stone Nature History Museum and her colleagues from China, Canada and the United States. The researchers scanned the remains of the ancient bird with an X ray micro CT and compared them to previously described specimens. Without scanning it is impossible to view the morphology of the skeletal elements obscured both by the preservation of soft tissue and the amber itself, which includes numerous inclusions, they noted. By examining the wing and feet close up, they found that the bird was a type of enantiornithine, an extinct group of dino era toothed birds. Although the skeletal remains are poorly preserved, the cumulative morphological features e.g., penultimate pedal phalanges longest, pedal ungual phalanges long and recurved suggest referral to the Enantiornithes, the dominant group of Cretaceous land birds and so far the only group identified with certainty in Burmese amber, they explained. According to the team, the specimen most likely represents a juvenile, like a majority of previously described specimens from Burmese amber. The limb proportions differ from that of the most complete enantiornithine previously reported in amber suggesting some ecological diversity among the enantiornithines in this fauna, the authors said. In this and other enantiornithine specimens the feathers are preserved with a visible brown color, suggesting this may not be indicative of in vivo coloration. Pale spots and bands are considered to be true features, they added. Although obscured by preservation and other inclusions in the amber, it appears that the plumage pattern differs in all specimens uncovered so far. In the future, novel chemical analyses may help to further elucidate how color patterns observed in feathers preserved within amber would actually translate to in vivo coloration. The study was published in the journal Frontiers in Earth Science.

The discovery is reported in a paper in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Named Primoptynx poliotauros, the ancient owl species was about 60 cm 23.6 inches tall. It belongs to a group of owls closely related to the extinct family Protostrigidae. The fossil owl was about the size of a modern snowy owl Bubo scandiacus. However, it is clearly distinguished from all extant species by the different size of its talons, said lead author Dr. Gerald Mayr, an ornithologist in the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum Frankfurt. While in present day owls the talons on all toes are approximately the same size, Primoptynx poliotauros has noticeably enlarged talons on its hind toe and second toe. Dr. Mayr and colleagues hypothesize that Primoptynx poliotauros used its feet to dispatch prey items in a hawk like manner, whereas living owls kill prey with their beak. Owls today have four toes with claws of equal size to catch relatively small preys and kill them with the beak, said co author Dr. Thierry Smith, a paleontologist at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. Primoptynx poliotauros has a longer first and second toe, as seen in hawks and other members of the family Accipitridae. Those more developed toes are used to pin down prey, which are punctured by the talons. So it was an owl that hunted like a hawk on medium sized mammals. The lifestyle of this extinct owl clearly differed from that of its modern relatives, Dr. Mayr added. The partial skeleton of Primoptynx poliotauros was found by U.S. paleontologists at Bighorn Basin in Wyoming about 30 years ago. The fossil shows that during the Early Eocene there were already many species of owls, of different sizes, which occupied different ecological niches. The success of the owls runs parallel to that of the mammals, which became very diverse after the fifth mass extinction, which wiped out the dinosaurs, the researchers said. The later extinction of Primoptynx poliotauros and other proto owls may have been due to the emergence of daytime birds of prey in the Late Eocene. It is not clear why owls changed their hunting technique in the course of their evolution, Dr. Mayr said. However, we assume that it may be related to the spread of diurnal birds of prey in the Late Eocene and Early Oligocene, approximately 34 million years ago. Competition for prey with diurnal birds of prey may have triggered feeding specializations in owls, possibly also leading to these charismatic birds nocturnal habits. The discovery of Primoptynx poliotauros also revealed a high level of diversity among the owls in the Early Eocene of North America from the small species Eostrix gulottai, measuring a mere 12 cm 4.7 inches, to the newly discovered large species.

The new dinosaur, scientifically named Lusovenator santosi, lived in what is now Portugal between 153 and 145 million years ago Jurassic period. The ancient predator was about 3.5 m 11.5 feet long and 1 m tall 3.3 feet, and walked on two hind limbs. It belongs to Carcharodontosauria, a large group of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods in the clade Allosauria. Lusovenator santosi as an early branching carcharodontosaurian allosauroid, said team leader Dr. Elisabete Malafaia from the Universidade de Lisboa and the Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia and her colleagues. It represents the oldest member of Carcharodontosauria defined in the Upper Jurassic of the ancient supercontinent Laurasia and extends the record of this group, which was already represented in the Lower Cretaceous of Europe. The paleontologists described Lusovenator santosi from two specimens found in Portugals Lusitanian Basin. One of the specimens is a 153 million year old partial skeleton of a juvenile individual from Praia de Valmit\u00e3o, the locality of Ribamar and municipality of Lourinh\u00e3. The second specimen is 8 million years younger, and belongs to a large sized individual of Lusovenator santosi. It was collected at Praia de Cambelas, in the locality of S\u00e3o Pedro da Cadeira and municipality of Torres Vedras. Despite the great similarity in the theropod faunal composition, the recognition of a carcharodontosaurian allosauroid taxon provides a component of the Upper Jurassic Lusitanian Basin distinct from its contemporaneous Morrison Formation in North America, the researchers said. The development of a terrestrial dispersal route connecting these landmasses after the late Tithonian 145 million years ago could explain the absence of Carcharodontosauria in the diverse theropod faunas of the Morrison Formation and, additionally, their presence during the Early and Late Cretaceous of North America. The new carcharodontosaurian theropod provides the first evidence for sympatry among allosauroid theropods in the Late Jurassic of Europe, they said. Additionally, the discovery of Lusovenator santosi sheds light on a poorly known period of carcharodontosaurian history and adds important data to the knowledge of the early evolution of these allosauroids. A paper on the discovery was published this month in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

The findings suggest that crocodiles may have migrated from Africa to America during the Miocene. The skull and associated lower jaw of an adult Crocodylus checchiai were collected in 1938 at the paleontological site of As Sahabi in northern Libya. The specimen was described in 1947 by the Italian paleontologist Angiola Maria Maccagno and then hosted in the collections of the Istituto di Paleontologia dellUniversit\u00e0 di Roma. In order to improve the knowledge about Crocodylus checchiai and its possible relationships with the American crocodiles, Dr. Massimo Delfino from the Universit\u00e0 di Torino and the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona and his colleagues tried to locate the original Crocodylus checchiai skull. The researchers succeeded in finding it in the collection of the Museo Universitario di Scienze della Terra of Sapienza University of Rome. They then used computed tomography CT imaging to re examine the well preserved specimen. They identified several new inner structures including a protrusion in the middle of the snout that has not been identified on any other African crocodile species. This unique structure, called the mid rostral boss, is also present in the four living American crocodile species Crocodylus intermedius, C. moreletii, C. acutus and C. rhombifer, and indicates a close evolutionary relationship between Crocodylus checchiai and the crocodiles from the Americas. Analyses of the evolutionary relationships between species suggest that Crocodylus checchiai may be part of the same lineage as the four American crocodile species, the scientists said. The remains of Crocodylus checchiai have been dated to around 7 million years ago while the oldest remains of an American crocodile, the extinct Crocodylus falconensis, have been dated to around 5 million years ago. Based on these findings, we propose that crocodiles reached America by migrating westwards from Australasia via Africa. The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.

In the wild, they regularly feed on scraps left behind by larger predators like bears and wolves, but the closer foxes live to human civilization, the more of their diet is made up of foods that humans leave behind. University of T\u00fcbingen researcher Chris Baumann and colleagues hypothesized that if this commensal relationship goes back to ancient times, then foxes might be useful indicators of human impact in the past. They compared ratios of carbon and nitrogen isotopes between the remains of various herbivores, large carnivores, and red and Arctic foxes from several Paleolithic archaeological sites in the Ach Valley Hohle Fels, Gei\u00dfenkl\u00f6sterle and Sirgenstein and the Lone Valley Bockstein, Hohlenstein Stadel and Vogelherd in Germany. At sites older than 42,000 years, when Neanderthals sparsely occupied the region, fox diets were similar to their local large carnivores. In this study, we were seeking to discover whether human hunting activity may have provided advantages for some animal species, Baumann said. Originally, the main food source for red and Arctic foxes was small mammals, which the foxes hunted. That was the case in the Middle Paleolithic, more than 42,000 years ago. In southwestern Germany that was the time of the Neanderthals and the Swabian Jura was only sparsely populated. But in the younger sites, as Homo sapiens became common in the area, foxes developed a more unique diet consisting largely of reindeer, which are too big for foxes to hunt but which are known to have been important game for ancient humans of the time. The results suggest that during the Upper Paleolithic, these foxes made a shift from feeding on scraps left by local large predators to eating food left behind by humans. This indicates that foxes reliance on human food goes back a good 42,000 years. The isotopic data from the fox bones indicate that the composition of several animals diets changed, said University of T\u00fcbingens Professor Herv\u00e9 Bocherens, co author on the study. We assume that these foxes now lived mainly on meat waste left behind by humans, or perhaps were even fed by them. The data showed the meat was from large animals that the foxes could not bring down  such as mammoth and reindeer. The humans dragged the whole reindeer into their caves. But the huge mammoths were butchered in the place they were killed. The team proposes that, with further studies investigating this fox human relationship, ancient fox diets may be useful indicators of human impact on ecosystems over time. Dietary reconstructions of Ice Age foxes have shown that early modern humans had an influence on the local ecosystem as early as 40,000 years ago, the authors said. The more humans populated a particular region, the more the foxes adapted to them. The findings were published online in the journal PLoS ONE.

Tongoenas burleyi inhabited the Tongan islands for at least 60,000 years, but vanished within a century or two of human arrival around 2,850 years ago. This canopy dwelling species was about 51 cm 20 inches long, not including the tail, weighed at least five times as much as the average city pigeon, and could fly. When I first found Tongoenas burleyi fossils in a cave on the Tongan island of Eua, I was immediately impressed by their size, said lead author Dr. David Steadman, curator of ornithology at the Florida Museum of Natural History. I said, Oh my God, Ive never seen a pigeon that big. It was clearly something different. Once we began excavating charred and broken remains of Tongoenas burleyi at archaeological sites, we knew it was another human caused extinction. Pigeons and doves just plain taste good, he added. Tongoenas burleyi co evolved with fruit bearing trees in the mango, guava and chinaberry families, acting as an essential forest cultivator by spreading seeds to new locations. Tongoenas burleyi was likely capable of swallowing fruit as big as a tennis ball, Dr. Steadman said. Some of these trees have big, fleshy fruit, clearly adapted for a big pigeon to gulp whole and pass the seeds. Of the fruit eating pigeons, this bird is the largest and could have gulped bigger canopy fruit than any others. It takes co evolution to the extreme. Dr. Steadman hypothesized Tongoenas burleyi featured the bright, even gaudy, plumage of other pigeons that live in treetops, where intense colors provide better camouflage than the muted browns and grays of pigeons that live on the ground. The absence of Tongoenas burleyi from the Tongan islands could threaten the long term survival of local trees that depended on the pigeon as a seed transporter, said co author Oona Takano, a doctoral student at the University of New Mexico. Tongoenas burleyi provided an important service by moving seeds to other islands. The pigeon species on Tonga today are too small to eat large fruits, which imperils certain fruit trees. In their study, the researchers analyzed the features of the hindlimbs femur, tibiotarsus, tarsometatarsus of the Papuan Oceanic pigeons and doves, dividing them into three groups tree dwelling species, ground dwellers and those that live both on the ground and in trees. We dedicated the study to the memory of W. Arthur Art Whistler, whose expertise in West Polynesian botany was unsurpassed. Whistler died from COVID 19 in April, Dr. Steadman said. There wasnt a plant on Fiji or Tonga that Art didnt know, including all of the pigeon dispersed fruits. He was a true plant nerd and complete salt of the Earth. He always made time for people.

Named Asio ecuadoriensis, the ancient bird was more than 70 cm 2.3 feet tall and had a wingspan of over 1.5 m 4.9 feet. It had longer and more robust legs than any other extant or extinct member of its genus Asio typical or true owls. We think that the climate change that occurred about 10,000 years ago, when the Ice Age ended, was partly responsible for the extinction of these large predatory birds, said co author Dr. Federico Agnolin, a paleontologist with the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales Bernardino Rivadavia, the Concejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas y T\u00e9cnicas, and the Fundaci\u00f3n de Historia Natural F\u00e9lix de Azara. The fossilized bones of Asio ecuadoriensis were collected from a small cave site Dr. Agnolin and colleagues interpreted as a fossil owl burrow. The paleontologists also found several specimens from three extant owl species Glaucidium sp., Tyto furcata and Athene cunicularia and skeletal remains of different mammals, including rabbits and rodents. The fossil owl remains of Tyto, Athene and Glaucidium show breakage and weathering, typical of stomach acid derived abrasion of owls, they said. This indicates that, as occurs with mammals coming from the site, they would be prey items of the owl that is the owner of the burrow. The large size of Asio ecuadoriensis, as well as the absence of acid derived weathering of the bones, may constitute indirect evidence that this species is the owner of the burrow. Asio ecuadoriensis is probably an owl specialized predator, they added. It is well known that owls usually prey on raptors, but predation on owls by owls is uncommon and remains poorly explored in the literature. If correctly interpreted, the present contribution may constitute the first fossil evidence of owl being killed by owls. The teams paper was published recently in the Journal of Ornithology.

Irisosaurus yimenensis is a small, early member of Sauropodomorpha, a group of long necked herbivorous dinosaurs that incorporates sauropods  such as Diplodocus, Brontosaurus and Titanosaurus  and their ancestors. The dinosaurs partial skeleton was found in the Fengjiahe Formation near Zhanmatian village in Chinas Yunnan province in 2018. The specimen was analyzed by Yunnan University paleontologist Claire Peyre de Fabr\u00e8gues and her colleagues. Sauropodomorph dinosaurs appeared during the Late Triassic epoch, the researchers said. The most ancient forms have been recovered in a supercontinent called Gondwana, although several Triassic genera were also found in the supercontinent Laurasia. By the Early Jurassic epoch, the group was most likely present on all the continents, even though specimens are still to be retrieved from Oceania. At that time, one hotspot for non sauropodan sauropodomorph diversity was southern Asia. In this context, southern China, and particularly the Yunnan province and its many Lower Jurassic layers, is an optimal location to study sauropodomorph Jurassic paleobiodiversity and the underlying evolutionary processes. Irisosaurus yimenensis was about 5 m\u00a016.4 feet in length, had long neck and tail, and walked on two legs. Based on the preserved material,\u00a0Irisosaurus yimenensis has a body plan close to that of the so called core prosauropods in having, for instance, cervical vertebrae longer than most dorsal vertebrae, gracile forelimbs, a deltopectoral crest extending half of the total length of the humerus and a unique carpal metacarpal complex, Dr. de Fabr\u00e8gues and co authors said. The teams phylogenetic analysis confirmed that Irisosaurus yimenensis belongs to non sauropodan sauropodomorphs. The study also indicated that the new dinosaur is as a sister species to Mussaurus, a genus of herbivorous sauropodomorph dinosaurs that lived in what is now Argentina some 215 million years ago Late Triassic epoch. Despite an already high diversity of early branching sauropodomorphs in the Early Jurassic of China, this study reveals yet another new species, adding to the known dinosaurian diversity and highlighting an unprecedented evolutionary mechanism that would have led some Chinese forms to a specialized herbivorous diet, the authors said. Their paper was published online in the journal Scientific Reports. "}, {"title": " New Species of Plant-Eating Dinosaur Identified in Switzerland", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Jul 16, 2020", "doc": "A new genus and species of long necked herbivorous dinosaur that lived during the Triassic period has been identified from fossils found in northern Switzerland. Schleitheimia schutzi lived approximately 210 million years ago Triassic period in what is now Switzerland. The ancient animal is one of the earliest representatives of Sauropodomorpha, a large group of long necked, herbivorous dinosaurs that includes the sauropods and their ancestral relatives. Sauropod dinosaurs are certainly among the most conspicuous elements of Mesozoic terrestrial vertebrate faunas, lead author Professor Oliver Rauhut from the Bavarian Natural History Collections and the Ludwig Maximilians Universit\u00e4t and his colleagues from Germany and Switzerland said in their paper. They include the largest terrestrial vertebrates and were the dominant herbivores in many Jurassic and Cretaceous ecosystems, probably accounting for a great part of vertebrate body mass in many environments in which they were abundant. However, the origin and early evolution of the group is still less well understood. The fragmentary fossilized remains of Schleitheimia schutzi were found in the\u00a0 Swiss canton of Schaffhausen. The fossils were long considered to belong to Plateosaurus, a genus of herbivorous dinosaurs that lived during the Triassic period, around 214 to 204 million years ago, in what are now Central and Northern Europe, Greenland, and North America. Professor Rauhut and co authors re examined the specimens and concluded that they were from a distinct species of sauropodomorph dinosaur. Although Schleitheimia schutzi probably looked quite similar to Plateosaurus, this dinosaur with an estimated 9 to 10 m 29.5 33 feet body length is already significantly larger than the latter, the paleontologists said. The new species was apparently very robust and, like its gigantic descendants, probably moved on all fours, while Plateosaurus mostly walked on its hind legs. The discovery of Schleitheimia schutzi shows that at least three different species of early sauropodomorph dinosaurs lived 210 220 million years ago in what is now Switzerland. Schleitheimia schutzi is a derived sauropodiform and might even represent the immediate outgroup to sauropods, the researchers said. In the context of a phylogenetic analysis, the new species indicates that the TriassicJurassic extinction event probably only had a minor effect on sauropodomorph evolution, and that the ascent of sauropods was delayed until the late Early Jurassic, when other early sauropodomorph lineages perished in the PliensbachianToarcian extinction event and gave way to an explosive radiation of that clade.

"}, {"title": " New Feathered Carnivorous Dinosaur Found in Brazil", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Jul 14, 2020", "doc": "Paleontologists have announced the discovery of a new genus and species of coelurosaurian dinosaur, Aratasaurus museunacionali, from the Romualdo Formation in the Araripe Basin, Brazil. Aratasaurus museunacionali roamed the Earth during the Cretaceous period, approximately 104 million years ago. The new dinosaur was a type of coelurosaur, a large group of small, lightly built, theropod dinosaurs which are more closely related to birds than to carnosaurs. Its remains were recovered from the Romualdo Formation, which is known worldwide for the large number of well preserved fossils. The fossil material is preserved in a dark shale slab with originally 1.2 m by 0.8 m 3.9 by 2.6 feet, and a thickness of around 3 cm 1.2 inches. Aratasaurus museunacionali is known by an incomplete but articulated right hind limb with the distal portion of the femur, proximal half of tibia and incomplete pes, said senior author Dr. Alexander Kellner from the Laboratory of Systematics and Taphonomy of Fossil Vertebrates at the Museu NacionalUniversidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro and colleagues. The bones showed that this Aratasaurus museunacionali specimen was a juvenile, with an estimated body length around 3.12 m 10.2 feet and a body mass of 34.25 kg. The extinct creature is closely related to Zuolong salleei, a coelurosaurian dinosaur that lived some 160 million years ago Jurassic period in China. The material known from Aratasaurus museunacionali differs from derived coelurosaurian groups e.g. Tyrannosauroidea, Ornithomimosauria and Megaraptora mainly regarding by the cnemial crest and the disposition and morphology of metatarsals, the paleontologists said. Among basal coelurosaurs, the new Brazilian theropod has a tibia similar to that of Zuolong salleei, and the pes more similar with that of Aarun zhaoi and Tanycolagreus topwilsoni. The new taxon represents the first occurrence of basal coelurosaurians in the Araripe Basin and suggests a widespread distribution of this group during the Lower Cretaceous, they said. The discovery of Aratasaurus museunacionali is reported in a paper in the journal Scientific Reports. "}, {"title": " New Species of Hook-Handed Dinosaur Uncovered in Montana", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Jul 13, 2020", "doc": "A new species of alvarezsaurid dinosaur that lived approximately 66 million years ago Cretaceous period has been unearthed in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, the United States. Dubbed Trierarchuncus prairiensis, the newly discovered dinosaur is a member of Alvarezsauridae, a group of unusual insect eating dinosaurs. Alvarezsaurids were typically small between 1 and 3 m, or 3.3 and 9.8 feet, long and had exceptionally short arms with a huge hypertrophied claw at the end, very long legs, a long snout filled with tiny teeth, and a body covered in sleek primitive feathers. They are known mainly from South America, Asia, and to a lesser extent North America. Trierarchuncus prairiensis is the youngest known alvarezsaurid and was one of the very last dinosaurs, which went extinct during the end Cretaceous mass extinction event. The dinosaurs fragmentary remains  three hand claws of different sizes  were collected from the Hell Creek Formation of Montana. One claw is the most complete known for Alvarezsauridae and shows their hand claws were more hookedcurved than previously thought. The extra hookednesscurvature would have been beneficial for digging or breaking apart rotten wood to search for insect prey. The new fossils represent a growth series from juvenile to adult, said lead author Dr. Denver Fowler of Badlands Dinosaur Museum and colleagues. This is important as it is recognized that dinosaurs changed in shape, often significantly, as they grew. Indeed, the fossils show that as Trierarchuncus prairiensis grew its hand claw became more robust blood vessel grooves on the sides of the claw became more deeply embedded in bone and the claw surface developed from being smooth in young individuals, into a rough surface texture in adults. Change through growth is significant as some previously named species of alvarezsaurids were described based on fossils that were small and probably pertained to young individuals, the paleontologists said. The new findings suggest that some of the supposedly unique features of these previously named species may in fact be due to their immature condition, rather than representing defining characteristics of a species. The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal Cretaceous Research. "}, {"title": " Large Dolphin from Oligocene Epoch was Fast-Swimming Apex Predator", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jul 10, 2020", "doc": "Paleontologists have found and described the first nearly complete skeleton of Ankylorhiza tiedemani, an extinct large dolphin that lived about 24 million years ago Oligocene epoch. With a body length of 4.8 m 15.7 feet, Ankylorhiza tiedemani was the largest member of the group Odontoceti toothed whales during the Oligocene  a size not surpassed until the early Miocene by sperm whales. The extinct animal was first described in the 1800s from a large fragmentary skull. Its first skeleton was discovered in the 1970s by then Charleston Museum Natural History curator Albert Sanders. The nearly complete skeleton analyzed in the new study was found in the 1990s in South Carolina by commercial paleontologist Mark Havenstein. It was later acquired by private fossil collector Mace Brown and subsequently donated to the Mace Brown Museum of Natural History at the College of Charleston. The specimen includes a well preserved skull, most of the vertebral column, ribcage and one flipper. The discovery is important because it is one of the first skeletons found of a very early member of the toothed whales dolphins, porpoises, and sperm whales, shortly after they diverged around 35 36 million years ago from baleen whales, said Dr. Robert Boessenecker, a paleontologist in the Department of Geology and Environmental Geosciences at the College of Charleston. What makes that important is its evolutionary position as a very early branching dolphin. Most early dolphins are known only from skulls, so having a skeleton with flippers and most of the vertebrae gives us an unprecedented look into the evolution of swimming adaptations. That unprecedented window surprisingly told us that baleen whales and dolphins have many similarities owing to convergent evolution since their evolutionary split 35 million years ago. The skeleton of Ankylorhiza tiedemani shows a few adaptations for faster swimming than other smaller dolphins, but also shows several primitive features. These primitive features are surprising because paleontologists and biologists long assumed that many of the adaptations for rapid swimming in baleen whales and toothed whales were ancient adaptations shared thanks to their common heritage over the past 35 million years, Dr. Boessenecker said. The degree to which baleen whales and dolphins independently arrive at the same overall swimming adaptations, rather than these traits evolving once in the common ancestor of both groups, surprised us, he added. Some examples include the narrowing of the tail stock, increase in the number of tail vertebrae, and shortening of the humerus upper arm bone in the flipper. This is not apparent in different lineages of seals and sea lions, for example, which evolved into different modes of swimming and have very different looking postcranial skeletons. Its as if the addition of extra finger bones in the flipper and the locking of the elbow joint has forced both major groups of cetaceans down a similar evolutionary pathway in terms of locomotion. Multiple lines of evidence show that Ankylorhiza tiedemani was a top predator in the community in which it lived. The species was very clearly preying upon large bodied prey like a killer whale, and is the first echolocating whale to become an apex predator. When Ankylorhiza tiedemani became extinct by about 23 million years ago, killer sperm whales and the shark toothed dolphin Squalodon evolved and reoccupied the niche within 5 million years. After the last killer sperm whales died out about 5 million years ago, the niche was left open until the ice ages, with the evolution of killer whales about 1 or 2 million years ago. Whales and dolphins have a complicated and long evolutionary history, and at a glance, you may not get that impression from modern species, Dr. Boessenecker said. The fossil record has really cracked open this long, winding evolutionary path, and fossils like Ankylorhiza tiedemani help illuminate how this happened. The findings were published in the journal Current Biology.

Leithia melitensis was first described by the Scottish naturalist Andrew Leith Adams in 1863. Roughly the size of a cat, the ancient rodent is by far the largest known dormouse species, being at least twice the size of other insular species both extant and extinct. Leithia melitensis is an example of island gigantism, a biological phenomenon in which the body size of an animal isolated on an island increases dramatically. Alongside the gigantic dormice, the Mediterranean islands of Malta and Sicily were also home to giant swans and owls as well as dwarf deer, hippos and elephants. While island dwarfism is relatively well understood, as with limited resources on an island animals may need to shrink to survive, the causes of gigantism are less obvious, said senior author Dr. Philip Cox, a researcher in the Department of Archaeology and the Hull York Medical School at the University of York. Perhaps, with fewer terrestrial predators, larger animals are able to survive as there is less need for hiding in small spaces, or it could be a case of co evolution with predatory birds where rodents get bigger to make them less vulnerable to being scooped up in talons. In the new study, the scientists digitally pieced together fossilized fragments from five skulls of Leithia melitensis to reconstruct the first complete skull of the species. The reconstructed skull is 10 cm 3.9 inches long  the length of the entire body and tail of many types of modern dormouse. Having only a few fossilized pieces of broken skulls available made it difficult to study this fascinating animal accurately, said lead author Jesse Hennekam, a PhD student in the Hull York Medical School at the University of York. This new reconstruction gives us a much better understanding of what the giant dormouse may have looked like and how it may have lived. The results were published in the journal Open Quaternary.

Despite its charismatic presence in pop culture, major aspects of Dilophosaurus wetherillis skeletal anatomy, taxonomy and evolutionary relationships were unknown until now. Its pretty much the best, worst known dinosaur. Until this study, nobody knew what Dilophosaurus wetherilli looked like or how it evolved, said study lead author Dr. Adam Marsh, a paleontologist in the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin and Petrified Forest National Park. Seeking answers to these questions, Dr. Marsh and his colleague, Jackson Schools Professor Timothy Rowe, examined five most complete specimens of Dilophosaurus wetherilli, all from the middle and lower part of the Kayenta Formation in the Navajo Nation in northern Arizona. Our study adds clarity to a muddled research record that reaches back to the first Dilophosaurus wetherilli fossil to be discovered, the specimen that set the standard for all following Dilophosaurus wetherilli discoveries, the researchers explained. That fossil was rebuilt with plaster, but the 1954 paper describing the find isnt clear about what was reconstructed  a fact that makes it difficult to determine how much of the early work was based on the actual fossil record. Early descriptions characterize Dilophosaurus wetherilli as having a fragile crest and weak jaws, a description that influenced the dinosaurs depiction in the Jurassic Park book and movie as a svelte dinosaur that subdued its prey with venom. But the study authors found the opposite. The jawbones show signs of serving as scaffolding for powerful muscles. They also found that some bones were mottled with air pockets, which would have helped reinforce the skeleton, including its dual crest. Theyre kind of like bubble wrap  the bone is protected and strengthened, Dr. Marsh said. These air sacs are not unique to Dilophosaurus wetherilli. Modern birds and the worlds most massive dinosaurs also have bones filled with air. In both cases, the air sacs lighten the load, which helped big dinosaurs manage their bulky bodies and birds take to the skies. Many birds use the air sacs to perform other functions, from inflating stretchy areas of skin during mating rituals, to creating booming calls and dispersing heat. The intricate array of air pockets and ducts that extend from Dilophosaurus wetherillis sinus cavity into its crests means that the dinosaur may have been able to perform similar feats with its headgear. To learn more about how the fossils compared with one another, the team recorded hundreds of anatomical characteristics of each fossil. The scientists then used an algorithm to see how the specimens compared with the first fossil  which confirmed that they were indeed all Dilophosaurus wetherilli. The algorithm also revealed that theres a significant evolutionary gap between this species and its closest dinosaur relatives, which indicates there are probably many other relatives yet to be discovered. The research is already being put into action, Dr. Marsh said. In the midst of the analysis, we discovered that a small braincase in the Jackson Schools collections belonged to a Dilophosaurus wetherilli. We realized that it wasnt a new type of dinosaur, but a juvenile Dilophosaurus wetherilli, which is really cool. The study was published online this week in the Journal of Paleontology.  Adam D.

Dromaeosauridae is a group of small to medium sized feathered predatory dinosaurs that flourished in the Cretaceous period. These dinosaurs lived all over the world, but their bones are often small and delicate and rarely preserve well in the fossil record, complicating efforts to understand the paths they took as they dispersed between continents. North American dromaeosaurids are thought to trace their origins to Asia, and Alaska would have been a key region for the dispersal of their ancestors. The new fossil is a tantalizing clue toward understanding what kinds of dromaeosaurs inhabited this crucial region. There are places where dinosaur fossils are so common that a scrap of bone, in most cases, cannot really add anything scientifically informative anymore, said lead author Dr. Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, a paleontologist at the Imperial College London. This is not the case with this Alaskan specimen. Even with such an incomplete jaw fragment, we were not only able to work out the evolutionary relationships of this dinosaur, but also to picture something more on the biology of these animals, ultimately gaining more information on this ancient Arctic ecosystem. The dromaeosaurid jawbone, which is 1.4 cm long and preserves the tip of the lower jaw and two teeth, was collected from exposures of the Prince Creek Formation in northern Alaska. Based on tooth shape and other characteristics, Dr. Chiarenza and colleagues attributed the fossil to a saurornitholestine dromaeosaurid. The early developmental stage of the specimen suggests this individual was still young and was likely born nearby. This study of a predatory dinosaur jaw from a baby provides the first physical proof that at least some dinosaurs not only lived in the far north, but they thrived there, said co author Dr. Anthony Fiorillo, a researcher at Southern Methodist University. One might even say, our study shows that the ancient north was a great place to raise a family and now we have to figure out why. This is the first confirmed non dental fossil specimen from a member of Dromaeosauridae in the Arctic, expanding on the role of Beringia as a dispersal route for this clade between Asia and North America, the paleontologists said. Furthermore, the juvenile nature of this individual adds to a growing body of data that suggests Cretaceous Arctic dinosaurs of Alaska did not undergo long distance migration, but rather they were year round residents of these paleopolar latitudes. The study was published online today in the journal PLoS ONE.

Named Kongonaphon kely, the ancient reptile was surprisingly small estimated height  10 cm, or 3.9 inches. Its tiny body size may help explain the origins of flight in pterosaurs and the presence of fuzz on the skin of both pterosaurs and dinosaurs. Theres a general perception of dinosaurs as being giants. But this new animal is very close to the divergence of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and its shockingly small, said Dr. Christian Kammerer, a research curator in paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Discovery of this tiny relative of dinosaurs and pterosaurs emphasizes the importance of Madagascars fossil record for improving knowledge of vertebrate history during times that are poorly known in other places, added University of Antananarivos Professor Lovasoa Ranivoharimanana. The partial skeleton of Kongonaphon kely was found in 1998 in the Morondava Basin of southwestern Madagascar. Kongonaphon kely isnt the first small animal known near the root of the ornithodiran family tree, but previously, such specimens were considered isolated exceptions to the rule, Dr. Kammerer said. In general, the scientific thought was that body size remained similar among the first archosaurs  the larger reptile group that includes birds, crocodilians, non avian dinosaurs, and pterosaurs  and the earliest ornithodirans, before increasing to gigantic proportions in the dinosaur lineage. Recent discoveries like Kongonaphon kely have given us a much better understanding of the early evolution of ornithodirans. Analyzing changes in body size throughout archosaur evolution, we found compelling evidence that it decreased sharply early in the history of the dinosaur pterosaur lineage. This miniaturization event indicates that the dinosaur and pterosaur lineages originated from extremely small ancestors yielding important implications for their paleobiology. Pitted microwear on Kongonaphon kelys conical teeth indicates a diet of hard shelled insects. This shift to insectivory, which is associated with diminutive body size, may have helped early ornithodirans survive by occupying a niche different from their mostly meat eating contemporaneous relatives. The study also suggests that fuzzy skin coverings ranging from simple filaments to feathers, known on both the dinosaur and pterosaur sides of the ornithodiran tree, may have originated for thermoregulation in this small bodied common ancestor. Thats because heat retention in small bodies is difficult, and the mid late Triassic was a time of climatic extremes, inferred to have sharp shifts in temperature between hot days and cold nights. The discovery is reported in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Now, a team of researchers from the UK has shown that only the Chicxulub impact could have created conditions that were unfavorable for non avian dinosaurs across the globe. The scientists also show that the massive Deccan volcanism could also have helped life recover from the asteroid strike in the long term. We show that the asteroid caused an impact winter for decades, and that these environmental effects decimated suitable environments for dinosaurs, said Dr. Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, a researcher in the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London and the Department of Earth Sciences at University College London. In contrast, the effects of the intense volcanic eruptions were not strong enough to substantially disrupt global ecosystems. Our study confirms, for the first time quantitatively, that the only plausible explanation for the extinction is the impact winter that eradicated dinosaur habitats worldwide. The Chicxulub strike would have released particles and gases high into the atmosphere, blocking out the Sun for years and causing permanent winters. Volcanic eruptions also produce particles and gases with Sun blocking effects, and around the time of the mass extinction there were tens of thousands of years of eruptions in the Deccan Traps province. To determine which factor, the asteroid or the volcanism, had more climate changing power, the scientists combined traditionally used geological markers of climate and powerful mathematical models with information about what kinds of environmental factors, such as rainfall and temperature, each species of dinosaur needed to thrive. They were then able to map where these conditions would still exist in a world after either an asteroid strike or massive volcanism. They found that only the asteroid strike wiped out all potential dinosaur habitats, while volcanism left some viable regions around the equator. Instead of only using the geologic record to model the effect on climate that the asteroid or volcanism might have caused worldwide, we pushed this approach a step forward, adding an ecological dimension to the study to reveal how these climatic fluctuations severely affected ecosystems, said Dr. Alex Farnsworth, a researcher in the School of Geographical Sciences at the University of Bristol. In this study we add a modeling approach to key geological and climate data that shows the devastating effect of the asteroid impact on global habitats. Essentially, it produces a blue screen of death for dinosaurs, said Dr. Philip Mannion, a scientist in the Department of Earth Sciences at University College London. Although volcanoes release Sun blocking gases and particles, they also release carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. In the short term after an eruption, the Sun blockers have a larger effect, causing a volcanic winter. However, in the longer term these particles and gases drop out of the atmosphere, while carbon dioxide stays around and builds up, warming the planet. After the initial drastic global winter caused by the asteroid, the teams model suggests that in the longer term, volcanic warming could have helped restore many habitats, helping new life that evolved after the disaster to thrive. We provide new evidence to suggest that the volcanic eruptions happening around the same time might have reduced the effects on the environment caused by the impact, particularly in quickening the rise of temperatures after the impact winter, Dr. Chiarenza said. This volcanic induced warming helped boost the survival and recovery of the animals and plants that made through the extinction, with many groups expanding in its immediate aftermath, including birds and mammals. The research was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Plotopterids family Plotopteridae are extinct, flightless and wing propelled diving birds that combine a striking mosaic of features characteristic for true penguins and pelecaniform birds like gannets, boobies, cormorants, and anhingas. The wing of plotopterids is remarkably similar to the flipper of penguins, to which it shows numerous parallels. Plotopterids developed in the northern hemisphere much later than penguins, with the first species appearing between 37 and 34 million years ago. Their fossils have been found at a number of sites in the United States California, Oregon, and Washington, Canada British Columbia and Japan. Unlike penguins, which have survived into the modern era, the last plotopterid species became extinct around 25 million years ago. In a new study, Dr. Gerald Mayr from the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum and his colleagues from the United States and New Zealand compared the fossilized remains of plotopterids with fossil specimens from three species of giant penguins  Waimanu, Muriwaimanu, and Sequiwaimanu  and identified previously unrecognized similarities and differences. The researchers found plotopterids and the ancient penguins had similar long beaks with slit like nostrils, similar chest and shoulder bones, and similar wings. These similarities suggest both groups of birds were strong swimmers that used their wings to propel them deep underwater in search of food. Some species of both groups could grow to huge sizes. The largest known plotopterids were over 2 m long, while some of the giant penguins were up to 1.6 m tall. Whats remarkable about all this is that plotopterids and ancient penguins evolved these shared features independently, said Dr. Vanesa De Pietri, Curator of Natural History at the Canterbury Museum. This is an example of what we call convergent evolution, when distantly related organisms develop similar morphological traits under similar environmental conditions. Some large plotopterid species would have looked very similar to the ancient penguins, said Dr. Paul Scofield, Curator of Natural History at the Canterbury Museum. These birds evolved in different hemispheres, millions of years apart, but from a distance you would be hard pressed to tell them apart. Plotopterids looked like penguins, they swam like penguins, they probably ate like penguins  but they werent penguins. The parallels in the evolution of these bird groups hint at an explanation for why birds developed the ability to swim with their wings. Wing propelled diving is quite rare among birds most swimming birds use their feet, Dr. Mayr said. We think both penguins and plotodopterids had flying ancestors that would plunge from the air into the water in search of food. Over time these ancestor species got better at swimming and worse at flying. A paper on the findings is published in the Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research.

Thylacosmilus atrox, also known as the marsupial saber tooth, is often presented as a classic case of convergent evolution, where animals appear similar in form despite having very different evolutionary relationships. The ancient creature had huge, ever growing canines, leading paleontologists to speculate that it was an even more vicious predator than the placental saber tooths such as the North American species Smilodon fatalis. The jaguar sized Thylacosmilus atrox was around half the size average body mass 117 kg of Smilodon fatalis, which was lion sized or larger 245 kg. But was it really a fierce predator like the extinct saber tooth cats, which seem to have been much like modern cats but with a different mode of killing their prey? Thylacosmilus atrox has impressive canines, for sure but if you look at the whole picture of its anatomy, lots of things simply dont add up, said University of Bristols Professor Christine Janis, first author of the study. For example, it just about lacks incisors, which big cats today use to get meat off the bone, and its lower jaws were not fused together. In addition, the canines of Thylacosmilus atrox were different from the teeth of other saber toothed mammals, being triangular in shape like a claw rather than flat like a blade. In the study, Professor Janis and colleagues compared aspects of the skull and teeth of Thylacosmilus atrox with both present day big cats and a diversity of extinct saber toothed cats. The skull superficially looks rather like that of a saber toothed placental. But if you actually quantify things, it becomes clear that Thylacosmilus atroxs skull was different in many details from any known carnivorous mammal, past or present, said co author Dr. Borja Figueirido, a researcher at the University of M\u00e1laga. Previous studies by other researchers have shown Thylacosmilus atrox to have had a weaker bite than Smilodon fatalis, said University of Birminghams Dr. Stephan Lautenschlager, senior author of the study. But what we can show is there was probably a difference in behavior between the two species Thylacosmilus atroxs skull and canines are weaker in a stabbing action than those of Smilodon fatalis, but are stronger in a pull back type of action. This suggests that Thylacosmilus atrox was not using its canines to kill with, but perhaps instead to open carcasses. Finally, the other teeth of Thylacosmilus atrox also pose problems for the interpretation of this animal as a cat like predator, whether saber toothed or not. Besides the puzzling lack of incisors, the molars are small, and did not wear down along the sides as seen in an animal feeding on meat. The molars tend to wear flat from the top, rather like you see in a bone crusher. But if you examine the detailed microwear on tooth surfaces, its clear that it was eating soft food. Its wear is most similar to that of cheetahs which eat from fresh carcasses and suggests an even softer diet than fed to captive lions, said co author Dr. Larisa DeSantis, a researcher at Vanderbilt University. Thylacosmilus atrox was not a bone crusher and may have instead specialized on internal organs. Its a bit of a mystery as to what this animal was actually doing but its clear that it wasnt just a marsupial version of a saber toothed cat like Smilodon fatalis, Professor Janis said. In addition to the differences in the skull and the teeth, it was also short legged and stiff backed, and lacked retractile claws, so it would have had difficulties in pursuing its prey, pouncing on it and holding on to it. I suspect it was some sort of specialized scavenger. It may have employed those canines to open carcasses and perhaps also used a big tongue to help extract the innards other mammals that have lost the incisors, like walruses and anteaters, also have big tongues that they use in feeding. The study was published in the journal PeerJ.  C. M. Janis et al. 2020. An eye for a tooth Thylacosmilus was not a marsupial saber tooth predator.

Named Mukupirna nambensis, the prehistoric creature was at least five times larger than living wombats and so different that the researchers have had to create a new family to accommodate it. The fossilized remains of Mukupirna nambensis  a partial skull and most of the skeleton  were found in 1973 in the clay floor of Lake Pinpa in northeastern South Australia by an expedition led by Dr. Richard Tedford from the American Museum of Natural History. It was an extremely serendipitous discovery because in most years the surface of this dry lake is covered by sands blown or washed in from the surrounding hills, said Professor Mike Archer, a scientist in the PANGEA Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. But because of rare environmental conditions prior to our arrival that year, the fossil rich clay deposits were fully exposed to view. And this unexpected view was breathtaking. On the surface, and just below we found skulls, teeth, bones and in some cases, articulated skeletons of many new and exotic kinds of mammals. As well, there were the teeth of extinct lungfish, skeletons of bony fish and the bones of many kinds of water birds including flamingos and ducks. These animals ranged from tiny carnivorous marsupials about the size of a mouse right up to Mukupirna nambensis which was similar in size to a living black bear. It was an amazingly rich fossil deposit full of extinct animals that wed never seen before.  Mukupirna nambensis weighed about between 143 and 171\u2009kg, similar in size to a black bear, and that it was probably a strong digger. An analysis of evolutionary relationships shows that the ancient animal is most closely related to wombats, but it has several unique features. Mukupirna nambensis clearly was an impressive, powerful beast, at least three times larger than modern wombats, said Dr. Robin Beck, a researcher at the University of Salford. It probably lived in an open forest environment without grasses, and developed teeth that would have allowed it to feed on sedges, roots, and tubers that it could have dug up with its powerful front legs. Mukupirna nambensis reveals a fascinating mix of characteristics and provides evidence of a close link between wombats and an extinct group of marsupials called wynyardiids, said Dr. Pip Brewer, a scientist in the Department of Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museum, London. It suggests that adaptations for digging for food may have existed in the very earliest members of the wombat family and likely led to their eventual survival to the present day. Although suggested previously, it had not been possible to test this, as the oldest fossil wombats discovered are only known from teeth and a few skull fragments. The team looked at how body size has evolved in vombatiforms, which is the group that includes Mukupirna nambensis, wombats, koalas and their fossil relatives, and showed that body weights of 100 kg or more evolved at least six times over the last 25 million years. The largest known vombatifom was Diprotodon, which weighed over 2 tons and survived until approximately 50,000 years ago. Mukupirna nambensis is one of the best preserved marsupials we know of this age from Australia, Dr. Beck said. It tells us a lot about the evolution of wombats, koalas and their relatives. It is remarkable for its large size  this was clearly an impressive, powerful beast. The description of this new family adds a huge new piece to the puzzle about the diversity of ancient, and often seriously strange marsupials that preceded those that rule the continent today, said Dr. Julien Louys, a researcher in the Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution at Griffith University. The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Redescribe Enigmatic Carboniferous-Period Fish", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Jun 23, 2020", "doc": "A team of U.S. paleontologists has redescribed the morphology of a long snouted ray finned fish called Tanyrhinichthys mcallisteri and created a more complete and accurate reconstruction of the fish as a living animal. Tanyrhinichthys mcallisteri lived around 300 million years ago Carboniferous period in an estuary environment in what is today New Mexico, the United States. The fish was between 15 and 20 cm long and had sharp, recurved teeth. It was first described in 1984 by Michigan State University paleontologist Michael Gottfried from a single specimen collected in the Kinney Brick Quarry. The specimen looks like someone found a fish and just pulled on the front of its skull, said Jack Stack, a researcher in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Michigan State University and the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania. Many modern fish species, from the swordfish to the sailfish, have protuberant snouts that extend out in front of them, often aiding in their ability to lunge at prey. But this characteristic is much rarer in ancient fishes. In the 2010s, several more specimens of Tanyrhinichthys mcallisteri were found in the same quarry. In a new study, Stack and colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania, Maryland National Capital Parks and Planning Commission, and New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science examined these specimens in detail and studied other species that dated to the same period. This sounds really simple, but its obviously difficult in execution as fossils are compressed flat when they are preserved, Stack said. What the scientists noticed cast doubt on the conception of Tanyrhinichthys mcallisteri as resembling a pike. While a pike has an elongated snout with its jaws at the end of it, allowing it to rush its prey head on, Tanyrhinichthys mcallisteri has an elongated snout with its jaws at the bottom. The whole form of this fish is similar to other bottom dwellers, Stack said. The team also noticed canal like structures on Tanyrhinichthys mcallisteris snout concentrated in the top of its head, suggestive of the locations where sensory organs would attach. These would have detected vibrations to allow the fish to consume its prey, said Dr. Lauren Sallan, a paleobiologist in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences and the Department of Biology at the University of Pennsylvania. The scientists noted that many of the species that dwelled in similar environments possessed longer snouts. This also makes sense because it was an estuary environment with large rivers feeding into it, churning up the water, and making it murky, Dr. Sallan said. Rather than using your eyesight, you have to use these other sensory organs to detect prey. Despite this, other features of the different ancient fishes morphology were so different from\u00a0Tanyrhinichthys mcallisteri that they do not appear to have shared a lineage with one another, nor do modern sturgeon descend from Tanyrhinichthys mcallisteri. Instead the long snouts appear to be an example of convergent evolution, or many different lineages all arriving at the same innovation to adapt well to their environment. Our work, and paleontology in general, shows that the diversity of life forms that are apparent today has roots that extend back into the past, Stack said. The teams results were published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. "}, {"title": " Coal-Burning Contributed to End-Permian Mass Extinction", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jun 23, 2020", "doc": "An international team of geologists has found the first direct evidence that volcanic eruptions in the southern part of the Siberian Traps region 252 million years ago burned large volumes of coal and vegetation. The end Permian extinction, also known as the Permian Triassic extinction event and the Great Dying, is the Earths most severe mass extinction that peaked about 252.3 million years ago. The catastrophe killed off nearly 96 of all marine species and 70 of terrestrial vertebrate species on the planet over the course of thousands of years. Calculations of sea water temperature indicate that at the peak of the extinction, the Earth underwent hot global warming, in which equatorial ocean temperatures exceeded 40 degrees Celsius 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Among the possible causes of this event, and one of the most long hypothesized, is that massive burning coal led to catastrophic global warming, which in turn was devastating to life. To search for evidence to support this hypothesis, Arizona State Universitys Professor Lindy Elkins Tanton and colleagues looked at the Siberian Traps region, where it was known that the magmas and lavas from volcanic events burned a combination of vegetation and coal. They focused on the volcaniclastic rocks  rocks created by explosive volcanic eruptions  and collected over 500 kg of samples. We found towering river cliffs of nothing but volcaniclastics, lining the river for hundreds of miles. It was geologically astounding, Professor Elkins Tanton said. As the samples were analyzed, the authors began seeing strange fragments in the volcaniclastics that seemed like burnt wood, and in some cases, burnt coal. Further field work turned up even more sites with charcoal, coal, and even some sticky organic rich blobs in the rocks. Our study shows that Siberian Traps magmas intruded into and incorporated coal and organic material, Professor Elkins Tanton said. That gives us direct evidence that the magmas also combusted large quantities of coal and organic matter during eruption. And the changes at the end Permian extinction bear remarkable parallels to what is happening on Earth today, including burning hydrocarbons and coal, acid rain from sulfur, and even ozone destroying halocarbons. Seeing these similarities gives us extra impetus to take action now, and also to further understand how the Earth responds to changes like these in the longer term, Professor Elkins Tanton added. The findings were published in the journal Geology.

Ive always wondered, where were Australias big carnivorous dinosaurs? But I think weve found them, right here in Queensland, said lead author Dr. Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist in the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences at the University of Queensland. The specimens of these gigantic dinosaurs were not fossilized bones, which are the sorts of things that are typically housed at museums. Rather, we looked at footprints, which  in Australia  are much more abundant. These tracks were made by dinosaurs walking through the swamp forests that once occupied much of the landscape of what is now southern Queensland. Dr. Romilio and colleagues documented a total of 20 fossil dinosaur tracks and five trackways from the Walloon Coal Measures of Oakey and Rosewood districts in southern Queensland. They identified a total of 11 track bearing mines sites one at Oakey, and ten at Rosewood, and four dinosaur track types. Large and very large tracks were more common than small tracks. Most of the tracks belong to theropods, the same group of dinosaurs that includes Australovenator, Velociraptor, and their modern day descendants, birds. Most of these footprints are around 50 to 60 cm in length, with some of the really huge tracks measuring nearly 80 cm, Dr. Romilio said. We estimate these tracks were made by large bodied carnivorous dinosaurs, some of which were up to 3 m high at the hips and probably around 10 m long. To put that into perspective, Tyrannosaurus rex got to about 3.25 m at the hips and attained lengths of 12 to 13 m long, but it didnt appear until 90 million years after our Queensland giants. The Queensland tracks were probably made by giant carnosaurs  the group that includes\u00a0Allosaurus. At the time, these were probably some of the largest predatory dinosaurs on the planet. The research was published in the journal Historical Biology.

Named Antarcticoolithus bradyi, the new fossil is the first fossilized egg found in Antarctica. The specimen exceeds eggs of all known non avian dinosaurs in volume and differs from them in structure. Measuring 29 by 20 cm 11.4 by 7.9 inches and weighing 6.5 kg, it is the largest soft shell egg ever discovered and the second largest egg of any known animal. Although the elephant bird egg is slightly larger, its eggshell is roughly five times thicker. University of Texas at Austin paleontologist Lucas Legendre and his colleagues from the United States and Chile think that Antarcticoolithus bradyi was laid by a giant marine reptile, such as a mosasaur  a discovery that challenges the prevailing thought that such creatures did not lay eggs. The fossil egg is from an animal the size of a large dinosaur, but it is completely unlike a dinosaur egg. It is most similar to the eggs of lizards and snakes, but it is from a truly giant relative of these animals, Dr. Legendre said. The researchers found several layers of membrane that confirmed that Antarcticoolithus bradyi was indeed an egg. The structure is very similar to transparent, quick hatching, eggs laid by some snakes and lizards today, Dr. Legendre said. However, because the fossil egg is hatched and contains no skeletal material, the scientists had to use other means to zero in on the type of reptile that laid it. They compiled a data set to compare the body size of 259 living reptiles to the size of their eggs. They found that the reptile that laid the egg would have been 7 m 23 feet long from the tip of its snout to the end of its body, not counting a tail. Adding to that evidence, the rock formation where the Antarcticoolithus bradyi egg was discovered also hosts skeletons from baby mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, along with adult specimens. Many authors have hypothesized that this was sort of a nursery site with shallow protected water, a cove environment where the young ones would have had a quiet setting to grow up, Dr. Legendre said. The study was published in the journal Nature.

Theyve also found that hard shelled eggs evolved at least three times independently in the dinosaur family tree. For many years there was scant fossil evidence of dinosaur eggs, and all known examples were characterized by thick, calcified shells  leading paleontologists to speculate that all dinosaur eggs were hard shelled, like those of modern crocodiles and birds. The assumption has always been that the ancestral dinosaur egg was hard shelled, said study first author Dr. Mark Norell, chair and Macaulay Curator in the Division of Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. Over the last 20 years, weve found dinosaur eggs around the world. But for the most part, they only represent three groups i theropod dinosaurs, which include modern birds ii advanced hadrosaurs like the duck bill dinosaurs iii and advanced sauropods, the long necked dinosaurs. Dr. Norell and colleagues studied embryo containing fossil eggs belonging to two species of dinosaur i Protoceratops, a sheep sized plant eating dinosaur that lived in what is now Mongolia between about 75 and 71 million years ago ii Mussaurus, a long necked, plant eating dinosaur that grew to 6 m 20 feet in length and lived between 227 and 208.5 million years ago in what is now Argentina. The researchers focused on the mineral and chemical compositions of the fossils, including a dark colored halo surrounding the fossilized embryos. We looked for any residue of a protein eggshell membrane, said study co author Jasmina Wiemann, a graduate student in the Department of Geology  Geophysics at Yale University. We essentially fingerprinted a large number of modern and fossil samples to build a dataset of the overall molecular picture of the eggshell through time. The scientists found that the early dinosaur eggs had a chemical residue that was non mineralized  meaning they were more like todays leathery turtle eggs, protecting their embryos with a soft outer covering. These dinosaurs buried their eggs in clutches, like modern animals that lay soft eggs, such as many lizards, snakes, and turtles, Wiemann said. This kept the eggs moist and protected. It works very well. The discovery also shows that the three main branches of dinosaurs  Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, and Theropoda  each started with soft eggshells. Hard, calcified eggshells evolved independently for each branch. By taking a step back and looking at the molecular data, we found that in this case their eggshells early dinosaurs were more reptilian than bird like in their reproductive behavior, said Matteo Fabbri, a graduate student in the Department of Geology  Geophysics at Yale University. The results appear in the journal Nature.

The newly discovered plant species lived approximately 360 million years ago Devonian period  a time when Australia was part of the supercontinent Gondwana. It is an extraordinary discovery, since such exquisitely preserved fossils from this period are extremely rare, said lead author Antoine Champreux, a PhD student at Flinders University. Plants and animals had just started to colonize continents, and the first trees appeared. Yet while diverse fish species were in the oceans, continents had no flowering plants, no mammals, no dinosaurs, and the first plants had just acquired proper leaves and the earliest types of seeds. Well preserved fossils from this era are rare  elevating the significance of the new plant fossil. Named Keraphyton mawsoniae, the ancient plant shares some similarities with modern ferns and horsetails. We named the genus Keraphyton like the horn plant in Greek, and the species Keraphyton mawsoniae, in honor of our partner Professor Ruth Mawson, the researchers said. The fossil was found in the 1960s by amateur geologist John Irving on the bank of the Manilla River in Barraba, New South Wales. The specimen is a straight, 90 cm long and 2 x 1 cm wide portion of anatomically preserved stem. It is characterized by a star shaped vascular system with strands located at rib tips, and by a lack of secondary tissues. There is no information on the lateral organs, their nature, size and arrangement in Keraphyton mawsoniae. Nevertheless, it provides sufficient features to demonstrate its uniqueness and its affiliation to a new genus and species. Its nothing much to look at  just a fossilized stick  but its far more interesting once we cut it and had a look inside, Champreux said. The anatomy is preserved, meaning that we can still observe the walls of million year old cells. We compared the plant with other plants from the same period based on its anatomy only, which provide a lot of information. The discovery is reported in the journal PeerJ. "}, {"title": " Cretaceous-Period Crocodiles from Korea Walked on Two Legs", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jun 12, 2020", "doc": "Multiple, well preserved trackways made by large crocodylomorphs, extinct ancestors of modern day crocodiles, between 110 and 120 million years ago Cretaceous period have been found near Sacheon City in South Korea. Surprisingly, the trackways never include handprints and indicate exclusively bipedal walking, a gait not known from fossil crocodylomorph trackways. Professor Kyung Soo Kim from Chinju National University of Education and colleagues discovered the well preserved crocodylomorph trackways with clearly defined foot impressions and localized skin traces at the Sacheon Jahye ri site of the Jinju Formation. The tracks are between 18 and 24\u2009cm long, indicating trackmaker body lengths over 3 m. It shocked us to learn that the trackways represent bipedal animals 3 4 m long, Professor Kim said. The footprints were initially thought to be made by a giant bipedal pterosaur walking on the mudflat, we now understand that these were bipedal crocodile prints, said University of Queenslands Dr. Anthony Romilio. The footprints measure around 21 cm, suggesting the track makers had legs about the same height as human adult legs. These were long animals that we estimate were over 3 m in length. And while footprints were everywhere on the site, there were no handprints. The paleontologists initially questioned the absence of hand impressions from the trackways, given that modern day crocodiles are quadrupedal four legged. Fossil crocodile tracks are quite rare in Asia, so finding an abundance of nearly one hundred footprints was extraordinary, Dr. Romilio said. As an animal walks, the hind feet have the potential of stepping into the impression made by the hand and over printing it, but we find no evidence of this at these Korean sites. It isnt due to poor preservation either, because these fossils are spectacular, they even have the fine details of the toe pads and scales on their soles preserved. The researchers named the new tracks Batrachopus grandis emphasizing the large size in comparison with much older and smaller 2 3 cm long tracks of the Batrachopus type, commonly found in the Jurassic of North America. Nobody expected such large bipedal crocs. The Jinju Formation is so rich in tracks you can read the entire ecology, said University of Colorados Professor Martin Lockley. Among the remains of some of the oldest terrestrially adapted crocodiles are large species that lived more than 200 million years ago Triassic period, and some paleontologists think they may have been bipedal. The Korean trackways prove this hypothesis, at least for the Cretaceous period, Dr. Romilio said. It also proves this adaptation was effective for millions of years, even with big fierce dinosaurs running around. The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The newly discovered dinosaur roamed the Earth some 90 million years ago during the Cretaceous period. Scientifically named Overoraptor chimentoi, the ancient creature was a gracile theropod, approximately 1.3 m 4.3 feet in length. It had very long and graceful arms, legs well adapted for running, and Velociraptor like sickle claw on the second toe. This feature is not present in birds, whose legs  more advanced in evolutionary terms  allow them to hold onto tree branches, said lead author Matias Motta from the CONICET and the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences Bernardino Rivadavia and his colleagues. The fossilized remains of Overoraptor chimentoi were recovered from the beds of the Huincul Formation in the Patagonian province of Rio Negro. The specimens were found in association with crocodilian and turtle bones. There are characteristics that distinguish Overoraptor chimentoi from the unenlagiid theropods of Argentina as well as from non South American raptors such as Velociraptor, said Dr. Fernando Novas, also from the CONICET and the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences Bernardino Rivadavia. When analyzing its arms, we found avian features related to the flight. This leads us to consider that in a phylogenetic tree, Overoraptor chimentoi is closer to birds than most of the raptors known so far. Our hypothesis is that in the case of Overoraptor chimentoi, its ability to automatically fold the wings must have had a different function than it does in flying birds, given it is a running animal, Motta added. It is possible that the dinosaurs arms had the role of guaranteeing balance during the race  by providing greater balance and precision  thanks to the possibility of moving them in a consistent manner, as happens in running birds such as the rhea or ostriches. Certain characteristics of the bones of Overoraptor chimentois arms, particularly the ulna, make them more similar to the wings of birds, such as those of the rheas and condors, than to other raptor dinosaurs, including unenlagiids. The paleontologists also found that Overoraptor chimentoi is closely related to Rahonavis, a paravian theropod dinosaur that lived 70 million years ago Cretaceous period in what is now northwestern Madagascar. Both species had raptor type legs and arms similar to the wings of birds, which means an evolutionary advance absent in both unenlagiids and velociraptors, Dr. Novas said. We think that due to its anatomical characteristics, Rahonavis must also have had the ability to perform the automatic folding of the wing, typical of birds, Motta said. These similarities would indicate that Overoraptor chimentoi and Rahonavis could form a new group of paravian runners, which would be closer to the birds than known raptor families. The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal Science of Nature.

The newly discovered dinosaurs roamed the Earth approximately 75 million years ago Cretaceous period. Named Navajoceratops sullivani and Terminocavus sealeyi, both species belong to Ceratopsidae, the same family as famous horned dinosaurs Triceratops, Centrosaurus, and Styracosaurus. Their fragmentary skulls were uncovered from the Hunter Wash Member of the Kirtland Formation in New Mexico. The specimens are intermediate in age between two previously known ceratopsid dinosaurs Pentaceratops and Anchiceratops. Pentaceratops lived 75.3 million years ago in New Mexico and had a distinctive deep notch on the back border of the frill, and a pair of spikes at the center of the frill that turn outwards like the wings of a butterfly. Anchiceratops had no notch in its frill and lived 3.8 million years later in what is now Canada. In the 1990s, Texas Tech University paleontologist Thomas Lehman proposed that Pentaceratops might have been the ancestor of Anchiceratops. Navajoceratops sullivani and Terminocavus sealeyi are intermediate in shape between these two dinosaurs and show how the notch in the frill became even deeper through time and eventually closed in on itself, explaining the lack of a notch in Anchiceratops. The two intermediate skulls form important links in a 5 million year lineage stretching from Utahceratops through Pentaceratops, to Anchiceratops, said study authors Dr. Denver Fowler and Dr. Elizabeth Freedman Fowler from Badlands Dinosaur Museum and Museum of the Rockies. The new specimens revealed a splitting event deep in the evolutionary history of long frilled ceratopsids chasmosaurines, after which a Pentaceratops lineage evolved a progressively deepening notch in the frill, contrasting against its sister group, the Chasmosaurus lineage, which evolved a progressively shallower notch. The origin of this evolutionary split occurred during the Late Cretaceous period, when a vast interior seaway flooded the lowlands of North America dividing it into eastern and western subcontinents, the paleontologists said. A short period of especially high sea level 85 83 million years ago brought the edge of the sea very close to the young Rocky Mountains. For hundreds of miles across what is now central Utah to southern Alberta, the coastal plain would have been as little as 5 10 km wide, providing very little habitat for dinosaurs. This would have effectively cut off northern and southern populations, which then probably evolved in isolation into two distinct lineages. However, after 83 million years ago, the sea receded from the mountain front, allowing northern and southern populations to mix again. The teams paper appears in the journal PeerJ.  D.W. Fowler  E.A.

Borealopelta markmitchellis spectacularly detailed mummified remains were found by accident in March 2011 by excavator operator Shawn Funk at the Suncor Millennium Mine in Alberta, Canada. The specimen was exceptional in preserving soft tissue, including scales and keratinous coverings of the bony armor across the body, while also maintaining its 3D shape. In addition to the animal tissue, a large spheroid mass within the dinosaurs abdominal cavity was also preserved. The finding of the actual preserved stomach contents from a dinosaur is extraordinarily rare, and this stomach recovered from the mummified nodosaur by the museum team is by far the best preserved dinosaur stomach ever found to date, said senior author Dr. Jim Basinger, a geologist in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Saskatchewan. When people see this stunning fossil and are told that we know what its last meal was because its stomach was so well preserved inside the skeleton, it will almost bring the beast back to life for them, providing a glimpse of how the animal actually carried out its daily activities, where it lived, and what its preferred food was. Dr. Basinger and colleagues found that the diet of Borealopelta markmitchelli consisted of 88 leaf material, but also included stems, wood and charcoal. The leaf fraction was dominated 85 by leptosporangiate ferns, the largest group of ferns today. The last meal of our dinosaur was mostly fern leaves  88 chewed leaf material and 7 stems and twigs, said co author Dr. Cathy Greenwood, a researcher in the Department of Biology at Brandon University. When we examined thin sections of the stomach contents under a microscope, we were shocked to see beautifully preserved and concentrated plant material. In marine rocks we almost never see such superb preservation of leaves, including the microscopic, spore producing sporangia of ferns. Specifically, they identified 48 palynomorphs microfossils like pollen and spores including moss or liverwort, 26 clubmosses and ferns, 13 gymnosperms mostly conifers, and two angiosperms flowering plants. Also, there is considerable charcoal in the stomach from burnt plant fragments, indicating that the animal was browsing in a recently burned area and was taking advantage of a recent fire and the flush of ferns that frequently emerges on a burned landscape, Dr. Greenwood said. This adaptation to a fire ecology is new information. Like large herbivores alive today such as moose and deer, and elephants in Africa, these nodosaurs by their feeding would have shaped the vegetation on the landscape, possibly maintaining more open areas by their grazing. The team also found gastroliths, or gizzard stones, generally swallowed by animals such as herbivorous dinosaurs and todays birds such as geese to aid digestion. Taken together, these findings enable us to make inferences about the ecology of the animal, including how selective it was in choosing which plants to eat and how it may have exploited forest fire regrowth, said lead author Dr. Caleb Brown, a paleontologist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology. It will also assist in understanding of dinosaur digestion and physiology. The study was published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

Named Kampecaris obanensis, the prehistoric millipede lived during the Silurian period, about 425 million years ago. The ancient creature was a small 2 3 cm in length, short bodied animal with three recognizable sections. It likely lived near a lake in a semi arid forested environment and ate decomposing plants. Its fossilized remains were unearthed on the island of Kerrera in the Scottish Inner Hebrides. The specimen is about 75 million years younger than the age other paleontologists have estimated the oldest millipede to be using a technique known as molecular clock dating. The oldest fossil of a land dwelling, stemmed plant, Cooksonia, has the same age as Kampecaris obanensis and is also from Scotland. Although its certainly possible there are older fossils of both bugs and plants, the fact they havent been found  even in deposits known for preserving delicate fossils from this era  could indicate that the ancient millipede and plant fossils that have already been discovered are the oldest specimens, said Dr. Michael Brookfield, a researcher in the Department of Geological Sciences at the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Massachusetts Boston. If thats the case, it also means both bugs and plants evolved much more rapidly than the timeline indicated by the molecular clock. Bountiful bug deposits have been dated to just 20 million years later than the fossils. And by 40 million years later, theres evidence of thriving forest communities filled with spiders, insects and tall trees. Who is right, us or them? Were setting up testable hypotheses  and this is where we are at in the research right now, said Dr. Elizabeth Catlos, also from the Department of Geological Sciences at the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin. Its a big jump from these tiny guys to very complex forest communities, and in the scheme of things, it didnt take that long, Dr. Brookfield said. It seems to be a rapid radiation of evolution from these mountain valleys, down to the lowlands, and then worldwide after that.

The newly discovered flying reptile lived during the Cretaceous period some 127 million years ago. Named Wightia declivirostris, it belongs to Tapejaridae, a bizarre group of small  to medium sized pterosaurs with wingspans of up to 4 m. Most tapejarids had large, highly elaborate soft tissue crests sweeping up from the front of the skull. The crests were probably used in sexual display and may have been brightly colored. These pterosaurs are well known from the Araripe Basin of northeast Brazil and the Jiufotang Formation of China. Elsewhere, however, their remains are exceedingly rare, with only fragmentary specimens reported from North Africa and Europe. Wightia declivirostris is the first record of Tapejaridae in the United Kingdom. Despite the number of near complete skeletons of tapejarids from China and 3D preserved examples from Brazil, elsewhere in the world, many tapejarids are highly fragmentary, and there remains much to learn about the group, especially from the tantalizing remains representing species from Spain, Morocco and now the Isle of Wight, said University of Portsmouths Professor David Martill and colleagues. The partial upper jaw bone premaxilla of Wightia declivirostris was found by fossil hunter John Winch in a plant debris bed of Wessex Formation at Yaverland, near Sandown on the Isle of Wight. The specimen is the first record of Tapejaridae in this formation and is amongst the oldest record of tapejarids outside of China. Although only a fragment of jaw, it has all the characteristic of a tapejarid jaw, including numerous tiny little holes that held minute sensory organs for detecting their food, and a downturned, finely pointed beak, said co author Megan Jacobs, a student at the University of Portsmouth. The paleontologists found that the fossil seemed more closely related to the tapejarid genus Sinopterus from China rather than Brazilian tapejarids such as Tapejara, Tupandactylus and Caiuajara. This new species adds to the diversity of dinosaurs and other prehistoric reptiles found on the Isle of Wight, which is now one of the most important places for Cretaceous dinosaurs in the world, Professor Martill said. The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal Cretaceous Research.

Scavenging between large carnivores, including cannibalism, is fairly common among modern groups, but direct evidence for it in the fossil record is extremely rare. Most cases of cannibalism among theropods have only been tentatively suggested. Definitive evidence through striated tooth marks has been recorded only in Tyrannosaurus rex and Majungasaurus crenatissimus, but never before in Allosaurus. Scavenging, and even cannibalism, is pretty common among modern predators, said Dr. Stephanie Drumheller, a paleontologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Big theropods, like Allosaurus, probably werent particularly picky eaters if it meant they got a free meal. Dr. Drumheller and her colleagues from Colorado Mesa University, Museums of Western Colorado, and Daemen College analyzed fossils from the Mygatt Moore Quarry, a 152 million year old fossil deposit in western Colorado, looking for bite marks. The researchers surveyed a total of 2,368 vertebrate fossils and found 684 specimens almost 29 of the sample preserving at least one theropod bite mark punctures, scores, furrows, pits, and striations. There were theropod bites on the large bodied sauropods whose gigantic bones dominate the assemblage, bites on the heavily armored Mymoorapelta, and lots of bites on theropods, too, especially the common remains of Allosaurus. There were hundreds of them, in frequencies far above the norm for dinosaur dominated fossil sites. Some were on meaty bones like ribs, but the team discovered others on tiny toe bones, far from the choicest cuts. Pulled together, the data paint a picture of an ecosystem where dinosaur remains lay out on the landscape for months at a time  a stinky prospect, but one that gave a whole succession of predators and scavengers a turn at eating. The distribution of the bite marks on skeletal elements, particularly those found on other theropods, suggest that they potentially preserve evidence of scavenging, rather than active predation, the scientists said. Given the relative abundances of the Mygatt Moore Quarry carnivores, partnered with the size estimates based on the striated bite marks, the feeding trace assemblage likely preserves the first evidence of cannibalism in Allosaurus.

Our ozone shield vanished for a short time in this ancient period, coinciding with a brief and quick warming of the Earth, said University of Southamptons Professor John Marshall, lead author of the study. Ozone layer is naturally in a state of flux  constantly being created and lost  and we have shown this happened in the past too, without a catalyst such as a continental scale volcanic eruption. Professor Marshall and colleagues collected rock samples during expeditions to mountainous polar regions in East Greenland, which once formed a huge ancient lake bed in the arid interior of the Old Red Sandstone Continent, made up of Europe and North America. The researchers also collected rock samples from the Andean Mountains above Lake Titicaca in Bolivia. These South American samples were from the southern continent of Gondwana, which was closer to the Devonian South Pole. They held clues as to what was happening at the edge of the melting Devonian ice sheet, allowing a comparison between the extinction event close to the pole and close to the equator. On microscopic examination, the researchers found many of the spores had bizarrely formed spines on their surface  a response to UV B radiation damaging their DNA. Also, many spores had dark pigmented walls, thought to be a kind of protective tan, due to increased and damaging UV B levels. During a time of rapid global warming, the ozone layer collapsed for a short period, exposing life on Earth to harmful levels of UV B radiation and triggering a mass extinction event on land and in shallow water at the Devonian Carboniferous boundary, the scientists said. Following melting of the ice sheets, the climate was very warm, with the increased heat above continents pushing more naturally generated ozone destroying chemicals into the upper atmosphere. This let in high levels of UV B radiation for several thousand years. During the extinction, plants selectively survived, but were enormously disrupted as the forest ecosystem collapsed. The dominant group of armored fish became extinct. Those that survived  sharks and bony fish  remain to this day the dominant fish in our ecosystems. These extinctions came at a key time for the evolution of our own ancestors, the tetrapods. Current estimates suggest we will reach similar global temperatures to those of 360 million years ago, with the possibility that a similar collapse of the ozone layer could occur again, exposing surface and shallow sea life to deadly radiation, Professor Marshall said. Our findings have startling implications for life on Earth today. This would move us from the current state of climate change, to a climate emergency.

The impact unleashed an incredible amount of climate changing gases into the atmosphere, triggering a chain of events that led to the extinction of non avian dinosaurs and 75 of life on the planet. According to new research, this was likely worsened by the fact that the Chicxulub asteroid struck at an angle of about 60 degrees  one of the deadliest possible angles. For the dinosaurs, the worst case scenario is exactly what happened, said lead author Professor Gareth Collins, a researcher in the Department Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London. Our simulations provide compelling evidence that the asteroid struck at a steep angle, perhaps 60 degrees above the horizon, and approached its target from the north east. We know that this was among the worst case scenarios for the lethality on impact, because it put more hazardous debris into the upper atmosphere and scattered it everywhere  the very thing that led to a nuclear winter. Professor Collins and colleagues examined the shape and subsurface structure of the crater using geophysical data to feed into the simulations that helped diagnose the impact angle and direction. Their analysis was also informed by recent results from drilling into the 200 km wide crater, which brought up rocks containing evidence of the extreme forces generated by the impact. Pivotal to diagnosing the angle and direction of impact was the relationship between the center of the crater, the center of the peak ring and the center of dense uplifted mantle rocks, some 30 km beneath the crater. At Chicxulub, these centers are aligned in a southwest northeast direction, with the crater center in between the peak ring and mantle uplift centers. The teams 3D simulations at an angle of 60 degrees reproduced these observations almost exactly. They reconstructed the crater formation in unprecedented detail and give us more clues as to how the largest craters on Earth are formed. Despite being buried beneath nearly one km of sedimentary rocks, it is remarkable that geophysical data reveals so much about the crater structure  enough to describe the direction and angle of the impact, said co author Dr. Auriol Rae, a researcher in the Department Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London and the Institute of Geology at the University of Freiburg. Large craters like Chicxulub are formed in a matter of minutes, and involve a spectacular rebound of rock beneath the crater, said co author Dr. Thomas Davison, from the Department Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London. Our findings could help advance our understanding of how this rebound can be used to diagnose details of the impacting asteroid.

Named Kompsornis longicaudus, the prehistoric bird lived approximately 120 million years ago Early Cretaceous epoch. It belongs to Jeholornithiformes, a group of long tailed birds slightly more advanced than the famous Archaeopteryx. These creatures are characterized by possessing a peculiar combination of primitive and derived bird features, such as the long bony tail and powerful flight ability. Kompsornis longicaudus further enriches the diversification of Jeholornithiformes and provides more information for understanding the morphologies of this group and bone fusion in the evolution of avialan dinosaurs, Dr. Xuri Wang from the Institute of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences and colleagues from China, Slovak Republic and Italy said in their paper. Kompsornis longicaudus was part of the Jehol Biota, an Early Cretaceous terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem preserved in a multi layered rock formation cropping out in the Chinese provinces of Liaoning, Hebei and Inner Mongolia. The nearly complete and articulated adult individual of the new bird was recovered from the Jiufotang Formation at the Lingyuan locality in Liaoning Province. Kompsornis longicaudus is a large long tailed avialan with the unique combination of features  it had extremely elongated tail, forelimb, and middle caudal vertebrae. Kompsornis longicaudus possessed completely fused sternum and pelvis, which is the first time to recognize a combination of advanced features among jeholornithiforms and non pygostylian avialans, the researchers said. The osteohistological investigation based on the rib of Kompsornis longicaudus indicates that it perished in the fifth year of life, approaching the somatic maturity but not reaching the fully grown stage. Comparing with other adult Jeholornis still with unfused sternum and pelvis, we assure that this feature is unrelated with ontogeny but suggests that more than one growth strategy evolved in Jeholornithiformes. According to the team, their discovery brings the total number of jeholornithiform species to six Kompsornis longicaudus, Shenzhouraptor sinensis, Jixiangornis orientalis, Jeholornis prima, Jeholornis palmapenis, and Jeholornis curvipes. The new discovery further enriches the diversity of Jeholornithiformes and suggests an unexpected developmental disparity in ossification patterns along the lineage from non avian dinosaurs to birds, the scientists said.

The cave bear was a very large type of bear that formed the sister lineage of living brown bears and polar bears. The animal lived during the Pleistocene epoch and became extinct approximately 25,000 years ago. It was 2.7 3.5 m 8.9 11.5 feet long and up to 1.7 m 5.6 feet at the shoulder, and has a mass between 225 and 500 kg. Dietary habits of the cave bear have widely been debated as different paleobiological studies produced different dietary inferences for the animal, ranging from carnivory to pure herbivory. It comes as big surprise that these animals  despite their size and the fact they lived in a cold and dry environment  exclusively subsisted on plants, said senior author Professor Herve Bocherens, a researcher in the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment and the Department of Geosciences, Biogeology at the University of T\u00fcbingen. While this vegetarian lifestyle has already been proven for the vast majority of cave bears in Europe, fossil discoveries from Romania gave rise to a lively scientific discussion as to whether cave bears in that region may also have fed on meat. For the study, Professor Bocherens and colleagues used 20,000 to 49,000 year old skeletal remains of six adult cave bears from the three Romanian cave sites M\u0103gura, Cioclovina and R\u0103sufl\u0103toarei. Well preserved bone specimens of cave bears from these three sites allowed us to examine the feeding behavior of the individuals from this region, the researchers said. They analyzed the nitrogen isotope values of amino acids in the bone collagen from the cave bear specimens. We measured special amino acids in the fossil bone collagen and subsequently compared the values with those from other cave bear bones as well as typical carnivores and herbivores in our case, a lion and a horse, Professor Bocherens said. Our results show that Romanian cave bears subsisted on an exclusively vegetarian diet before they became extinct about 25,000 years ago. The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The 300,000 year old skeleton of a female straight tusked elephant was found at the famous Pleistocene site at Sch\u00f6ningen, Lower Saxony, Germany. The site is best known for the discovery of wooden spears, the butchered remains of horses and other large mammals, and the remains of saber toothed cats Homotherium latidens. We found both 2.3 m long tusks, the complete lower jaw, numerous vertebrae and ribs as well as large bones belonging to three of the legs and even all five delicate hyoid bones, said Dr. Jordi Serangeli, an archaeologist in the Senckenberg Centre for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment at the University of T\u00fcbingen. The elephant is an older female with worn teeth, added Ivo Verheijen, an archaeozoologist at Leiden University. The animal had a shoulder height of about 3.2 m and weighed about 6.8 tons  it was therefore larger than todays African elephant cows. It most probably died of old age and not as a result of human hunting. Elephants often remain near and in water when they are sick or old, he added. Numerous bite marks on the recovered bones show that carnivores visited the carcass. However, the hominins of that time would have profited from the elephant too. The archaeologists found 30 small flint flakes and two long bones which were used as tools for knapping. They also found micro flakes embedded into these bones, which proves that resharpening of stone tools took place near to the elephant remains. Stone Age hunters probably cut meat, tendons and fat from the carcass, Dr. Serangeli said. Elephants that die may have been a diverse and relatively common source of food and resources for Homo heidelbergensis. Although the Paleolithic hominins were accomplished hunters, there was no compelling reason for them to put themselves in danger by hunting adult elephants, he said. Straight tusked elephants were a part of their environment, and the hominins knew that they frequently died on the lakeshore. With the new find from Sch\u00f6ningen we do not seek to rule out that extremely dangerous elephant hunts may have taken place, but the evidence often leaves us in some doubt.

Titanichthys lived in shallow seas of Morocco, North America and Europe some 380 million years ago Devonian period. It likely exceeded 5 m in length and its lower jaw reached lengths exceeding 1 m. However, unlike its similarly giant contemporary Dunkleosteus, there is no previous evidence of how Titanichthys fed. University of Bristol paleobiologist Samuel Coatham, University of Zurichs Professor Christian Klug and their colleagues sought to investigate the question indirectly, using biomechanical analysis to compare the lower jaw of Titanichthys with those of other species. We have found that Titanichthys was very likely to have been a suspension feeder, showing that its lower jaw was considerably less mechanically robust than those of other placoderm species that fed on large or hard shelled prey, Coatham said. Consequently, those feeding strategies common amongst its relatives would probably have not been available for Titanichthys. The scientists analyzed a nearly complete lower jaw of Titanichthys found in the Southern Ma\u00efder basin, Morocco. They tested the resilience of their specimens by virtually applying forces to the jaws, using a technique called finite element analysis FEA to assess how likely each jaw was to break or bend. This revealed that the lower jaw of Titanichthys was much less resistant to stress and was more likely to break than those of the other placoderm species, such as Dunkleosteus. Therefore, the jaw of Titanichthys probably would not have been able to withstand the higher stresses associated with their strategies of feeding on large prey, which thus exert more mechanical stress on the jaws. This pattern was consistent in both sharks and whales, with the suspension feeder proving less resistant to stress than the other species within the same lineage. Further analyses comparing the distribution of stress across the jaws showed similar patterns in Titanichthys and the basking shark, reinforcing this comparison. Our methods could be extended to identify other such species in the fossil record and investigate whether there were common factors driving the evolution and extinction of these species, Coatham said. We suggest a link between oceanic productivity and the evolution of Titanichthys, but this should be investigated in detail in the future. An established link could have implications for our understanding of the conservation of modern suspension feeders.

South Walker Creek, the youngest megafauna site in northern Australia, was once home to at least 16 species of megafauna, including thirteen extinct and three extant species. Carnivorous megafauna was represented by the marsupial lion Thylacoleo, at least three crocodilians Crocodylus porosus, Pallimnarchus sp. and Quinkana sp. and two giant monitor lizards Varanus priscus or Megalania and a Komodo dragon sized species. Plant eating megafauna was diverse with two species of wombats, one palorchestid marsupial, two diprotodontids, the emu Dromaius novaehollandiae, and five species of kangaroos. One kangaroo species was 2.5 m tall and had an estimated mass of 274 kg, this makes it the largest kangaroo of all time. The megafauna at South Walker Creek were uniquely tropical, dominated by huge reptilian carnivores and mega herbivores that went extinct around 40,000 years ago, well after humans arrived onto mainland Australia, said Dr. Scott Hocknull, a paleontologist at Queensland Museum and the University of Melbourne. While the rest of the world had giant carnivores like saber toothed cats, bears and hyenas, Australias predators were mostly giant reptiles, including an extinct freshwater croc around 7 m long, a relation to the modern salt water crocodile and a land dwelling crocodile, he added. There were also two giant lizards including a 6 m long lizard called Megalania and another giant lizard, similar in size to the Komodo dragon. We cannot place humans at this 40,000 year old crime scene, we have no firm evidence. Therefore, we find no role for humans in the extinction of these species of megafauna, Dr. Hocknull said. Instead, we do find that their extinction is coincident with major climatic and environmental deterioration both locally and regionally, including increased fire, reduction in grasslands and loss of freshwater. Together, these sustained changes were simply too much for the largest of Australias animals to cope with. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.

It is the first elaphrosaur known from the Australian continent. The newly discovered dinosaur belongs to Elaphrosaurinae, an enigmatic group of gracile ceratosaurian dinosaurs known from the Late Jurassic period of Africa and Asia, and the early Late Cretaceous period of Argentina. Elaphrosaurs were strange looking dinosaurs  they ran low to the ground on two legs, with a slender body, long neck, stubby arms, and a delicate toothless skull, said Dr. Tim Ziegler, collection manager of vertebrate palaeontology at Museums Victoria. They started life eating a wide range of foods, but shed their teeth as they aged. Elaphrosaurs are unusual among theropods because adults had a plant based diet, rather than hunting prey. Young elaphrosaurs might have hunted the tiny monotremes along with snapping up insects and fruits. The nearly complete neck vertebra of the new elaphrosaur was found at the Eric the Red West site  which is part of the Eumeralla Formation  near Cape Otway, Victoria, by Dinosaur Dreaming volunteer Jessica Parker in 2015. This is the first record of Elaphrosaurinae from Australia and is only the second Cretaceous record of the group worldwide. In tandem with the recently described dinosaur Huinculsaurus montesi, the new elaphrosaur extends the record of Elaphrosaurinae by more than 40 million years. New discoveries like this elaphrosaur fossil overturn past ideas, and help to interpret discoveries yet to come, Dr. Ziegler said. The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal Gondwana Research.

Theropod dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial carnivores during much of the Mesozoic era. These dinosaurs ranged in mass from 200 g to 9,000 kg and occupied much of the available niche space. While no single adaptation is likely to explain such widespread dominance and diversity of form, the bipedal locomotory system employed by theropods is invoked as an important reason for the success of this lineage. Plenty of research has explored the relationship between their locomotion and lifestyle. Much of this work has focused on running speeds, but Dr. Alexander Dececchi of Mount Marty College and colleagues argue that speed might not be the most important factor, especially for the biggest theropods. The researchers gathered data on limb proportions, body mass, and gaits of more than 70 species of theropod dinosaurs. They then applied a variety of methods to estimate each dinosaurs top speed as well as how much energy they expended while moving around at more relaxed walking speeds. Among smaller to medium sized species, longer legs appear to be an adaptation for faster running, in line with previous results. But for the real titans, top running speed is limited by body size, so longer legs instead correlated with low energy walking. Running is important for hunters, but they generally spend much more time roaming around in search of food. While speed was a major advantage for dinosaurs who needed to hunt prey and also escape predators, the biggest theropods relied more on efficiency while foraging, Dr. Dececchi and co authors said. Among giant theropods, the champions were tyrannosaurs like T. rex, whose long legs were apparently well adapted for reduced energy expenditure while prowling for prey. Size matters. Smaller theropods were both hunter and the hunted, so their lives were lived at high speed. For giants like T. rex, a top predator with no natural enemies, life was a marathon not a sprint.

The researchers believe these strange structures might have acted as a buoyancy chamber to allow the animals to float in seawater but also protect them. Crinoids, also known as sea lilies or feather stars, are part of a large group of marine invertebrate animals called echinoderms. Other echinoderms are starfish, brittle stars, sand dollars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. The skeleton of echinoderms is made of the mineral calcite, and consists of hundreds of individual plates of different shapes and sizes. All living echinoderms have what is called pentameral symmetry, which means their bodies are organized in patterns of five for example, the five arms of the common starfish. Crinoids may have as few as five arms, but usually they have arms in multiples of five. Crinoids are unusual looking animals because they look more like plants than animals. Superficially, the stem or column of a crinoid resembles the stalk of a flower, the calyx or head resembles the sepals of a flower, and the arms resemble the petals of a flower. These marine animals first appeared in the seas of the Cambrian period, about 300 million years before dinosaurs. They flourished during Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, and some survive to the present day. Around 600 living species are known most are free living feather stars or comatulids living in the shallow seas. Crinoids were in a very dangerous place millions of years ago when the oceans were shallower and they shared them with predators such as crabs and fish, said co author Dr. Aaron Hunter, a researcher in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Western Australia and the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge. Survival was critical and the ball like structures, able to withstand very heavy loads, formed around them to protect them from the harms of the ocean and aid buoyancy. These animals could then spread around the world and have been found in chalk rocks from Texas, US to Kalbarri in Western Australia. They could form a snow shoe to sit on the bottom of the shallow oceans or float and relocate to safer places. Dr. Hunter and his colleague, Dr. Jennifer Hoyal Cuthill from the Institute of Analytics  Data Science  School of Life Sciences at the University of Essex, the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge, and the Earth Life Science Institute at Tokyo Institute of Technology, analyzed the fossilized remains of Marsupites testudinarius and Uintacrinus socialis, two crinoid species that lived 80 million years ago Cretaceous period. Both species possessed long feeding arms and an enlarged, close to spherical head, composed of 16 large plates in Marsupites testudinarius but many more, small plates in Uintacrinus socialis. According to the team, the heads of these animals show structural similarities to carbon fullerene and fulleroid molecules, respectively. Marsupites testudinarius had fewer but relatively large plates, creating a stable structure, Dr. Hunter said. Uintacrinus socialis on the other hand has far more complex plates that form a dome. The structures are also found in the carbon molecule buckminsterfullerene but this is the first time we have found such a structure in fossils and it still remains a mystery why these successful structures did not evolve again. The findings were published in the journal Palaeontology.

The 195 million year old specimen was found in the 19th century near Lyme Regis on the Jurassic coast of southern England. The fossil predates previously recorded similar specimens by more than 10 million years. Since the 19th century, the Blue Lias and Charmouth Mudstone formations of the Dorset coast have provided large numbers of important body fossils that inform our knowledge of coleoid paleontology, said lead author Professor Malcolm Hart, a paleontologist in the School of Geography, Earth  Environmental Sciences at the University of Plymouth. In many of these mudstones, specimens of paleobiological significance have been found, especially those with the arms and hooks with which the living animals caught their prey. This, however, is a most unusual if not extraordinary fossil as predation events are only very occasionally found in the geological record. It points to a particularly violent attack which ultimately appears to have caused the death, and subsequent preservation, of both animals. The fossilized remains indicate a brutal incident in which the head bones of the fish were apparently crushed by its attacker. The researchers have two hypotheses for how the two animals ultimately came to be preserved together for eternity. Firstly, the fish was too large for its attacker or became stuck in its jaws so that the pair settled to the seafloor where they were preserved, they said. Alternatively, Clarkeiteuthis montefiorei took its prey to the seafloor in a display of distraction sinking to avoid the possibility of being attacked by another predator. However, in doing so it entered waters low in oxygen and suffocated. The scientists presented their findings this week at\u00a0Sharing Geoscience Online, a virtual alternative to the traditional General Assembly held annually by the European Geosciences Union EGU. "}, {"title": " Raptorial Dinosaurs Did Not Hunt in Coordinated Packs, Paleontologists Say", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "May 7, 2020", "doc": "An analysis of the fossilized teeth of Deinonychus antirrhopus, a species of wolf sized dromaeosaurid dinosaur that lived between 115 and 108 million years ago Cretaceous period in what is now the United States, adds to the growing evidence that this and other raptors were not complex social hunters by modern mammalian standards. The image of the highly intelligent, pack hunting raptor has become engrained in scientific literature and popular works alike. First proposed to explain the relatively common co occurrence of large herbivorous dinosaurs and much smaller Deinonychus antirrhopus from the Cretaceous of North America, a wolf like social hunting structure has become the standard depiction of raptors in popular works over the last three decades. Raptorial dinosaurs often are shown as hunting in packs similar to wolves, said Dr. Joseph Frederickson, a vertebrate paleontologist and director of the Weis Earth Science Museum at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh Fox Cities Campus. The evidence for this behavior, however, is not altogether convincing. Since we cant watch these dinosaurs hunt in person, we must use indirect methods to determine their behavior in life. Though widely accepted, evidence for the pack hunting dinosaur proposed by Yale University paleontologist John Ostrom is relatively weak, he added. The problem with this idea is that living dinosaurs birds and their relatives crocodilians do not usually hunt in groups and rarely ever hunt prey larger than themselves. Further, behavior like pack hunting does not fossilize so we cant directly test whether the animals actually worked together to hunt prey. Paleontologists recently proposed a different model for behavior in raptors that is thought to be more like Komodo dragons or crocodiles, in which individuals may attack the same animal but cooperation is limited. We proposed in this study that there is a correlation between pack hunting and the diet of animals as they grow, Dr. Frederickson said. In Komodo dragons, babies are at risk of being eaten by adults, so they take refuge in trees, where they find a wealth of food unavailable to their larger ground dwelling parents. Animals that hunt in packs do not generally show this dietary diversity. If we can look at the diet of young raptors versus old raptors, we can come up with a hypothesis for whether they hunted in groups, Dr. Frederickson explained. To do this, Dr. Frederickson and his colleagues from the University of Oklahoma and the Sam Noble Museum analyzed the chemistry of teeth from Deinonychus antirrhopus. Stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen were used to get an idea of diet and water sources for these animals, he said. We also looked at a crocodilian and an herbivorous dinosaur from the same geologic formation. The paleontologists found that Cretaceous crocodilians, like modern species, show a difference in diet between the smallest and largest teeth, indicating a distinct transition in diet as they grew. This is what we would expect for an animal where the parents do not provide food for their young, Dr. Frederickson said. We also see the same pattern in the raptors, where the smallest teeth and the large teeth do not have the same average carbon isotope values, indicating they were eating different foods. This means the young were not being fed by the adults, which is why we believe Jurassic Park was wrong about raptor behavior. The research is published in the journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology.

The Devonian period is one of the most important time periods for the evolution of land plants. It witnessed diversification from small mosses to towering complex forests. The development of different spore sizes, or heterospory, represents a major modification to control reproduction  a feature that later evolved into small and large versions of these reproductive units. Think of all the different types of sexual systems that are in flowers  all of that is predicated on having separate small spores, or pollen, and big spores, which are inside the seeds, said senior author Dr. Andrew Leslie, a researcher in the Geological Sciences Department at Stanford University. With two discrete size classes, its a more efficient way of packaging resources because the big spores cant move as easily as the little ones, but can better nourish offspring. The newly discovered plant species belongs to the herbaceous barinophytes, an unusual extinct group of plants that may be related to clubmosses, and is one of the most comprehensive examples of a seemingly intermediate stage of plant reproductive biology. Usually when we see heterosporous plants appear in the fossil record, they just sort of pop into existence, Dr. Leslie said. We think this may be kind of a snapshot of this very rarely witnessed transition period in evolutionary history where you see high variation amongst spores in the reproductive structure. Dr. Leslie and colleagues analyzed fossilized plants from the collections of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. From about 30 small chips of rock originally collected from the Campbellton Formation of New Brunswick in Canada by paleobotanist and co author Dr. Francis Hueber, they identified more than 80 sporangia reproductive structures. The spores themselves range from about 70 to 200 microns in diameter. While some of the structures contained exclusively large or small spores, others held only intermediate sized spores and others held the entire range of spore sizes  possibly with some producing sperm and others eggs. Its rare to get this many sporangia with well preserved spores that you can measure, Dr. Leslie said. We just kind of got lucky in how they were preserved. Together with the previously described plant group Chaleuria, the new species represents the first evidence of more advanced reproductive biology in land plants. The next example doesnt appear in the fossil record until about 20 million years later. These kinds of fossils help us locate when and how exactly plants achieved that kind of partitioning of their reproductive resources, Dr. Leslie said. The very end of that evolutionary history of specialization is something like a flower. The teams paper was published in the May 4, 2020 issue of the journal Current Biology.

Spinosaurus aegyptiacus is a giant theropod dinosaur that lived about 95 million years ago Cretaceous period in what is now North Africa. In a previous study, this creature had been identified as a fish eating dinosaur with adaptations for an amphibious lifestyle, supported by its relatively short hindlimbs, wide feet, dense bones and elongated jaws studded with conical teeth. However, suggestions that it may have been a truly water dwelling dinosaur were met with considerable opposition, in large part because the partial skeleton provided little to no evidence of the propulsive structure needed to move such a giant dinosaur through water. A research team led by National Geographic Explorer and University of Detroit Mercy paleontologist Nizar Ibrahim to the Kem Kem site where parts of the Spinosaurus aegyptiacus skeleton had first been uncovered in 2008. Between 2015 and 2019, the researchers recovered many more fossils, including a remarkably complete, fin like tail capable of extensive lateral movement and characterized by extremely long spines. They then used photogrammetry to digitally capture the anatomy of the tail of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus. To quantitatively assess the performance of the tail, they made a flexible model and attached it to a robotic system that mimics swimming movements. They then compared the swimming performance of the model Spinosaurus aegyptiacus tail to those from crocodiles, newts and other dinosaurs. The results were fully consistent with the idea of a truly water dwelling, tail propelled, river monster. This dinosaur was actively pursuing prey in the water column, not just standing in shallow waters waiting for fish to swim by. It probably spent most of its life in the water, Dr. Ibrahim said. This new discovery changes our current understanding of dinosaurs and reflects Dr. Ibrahims boundless curiosity and dedication to uncovering the secrets of the Saharas dinosaurs, added Alex Moen, vice president of explorer programs at the National Geographic Society. His work is at the nexus of science and exploration, and embodies the unique role National Geographic has in illuminating the wonder of our world.

Named Adalatherium hui, the ancient creature lived about 66 million years ago Cretaceous period among dinosaurs, massive crocodiles, and snakes. It belongs to Gondwanatheria, a lesser known group of mammals that are only known from the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana and previously were represented by only a single skull and isolated jaws and teeth. Gondwanatherian fossils were first found in Argentina in the 1980s, but have since also been found in Africa, India, the Antarctic Peninsula, and Madagascar. Gondwanatherians were first thought to be related to modern day sloths, anteaters, and armadillos but now are known to have been part of a grand evolutionary experiment, doing their own thing, an experiment that failed and was snuffed out in the Eocene, about 45 million years ago, said lead author Dr. David Krause, a vertebrate paleontologist in the Department of Earth Sciences at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science and the Department of Anatomical Sciences at Stony Brook University. The well preserved skeleton of Adalatherium hui  the most complete for any mammal from the entire Mesozoic of the southern hemisphere  was recovered from the Maevarano Formation, northwestern Madagascar. Around the size of a domestic cat at about 3.1 kg, the ancient mammal was unusual in that it was very large for its day most mammals that lived alongside dinosaurs were much smaller, mouse sized on average. Knowing what we know about the skeletal anatomy of all living and extinct mammals, it is difficult to imagine that a mammal like Adalatherium hui could have evolved it bends and even breaks a lot of rules, Dr. Krause said. In fact, although a life like reconstruction might lead one to think that Adalatherium hui was a run of the mill badger, its normality is literally only skin deep. Adalatherium hui is the oddest of oddballs, said co author Dr. Simone Hoffmann, a paleontologist in the New York Institute of Technology. Trying to figure out how it moved is nearly impossible because, for instance, its front end is telling us a different story than its back end. Adalatherium hui had primitive features in its snout region that hadnt been seen for a hundred million years in the lineage leading to modern mammals. Its nasal cavity exhibits an amazing mosaic of features, some of which are very standard for a mammal, but some that Ive never seen in anything before, added co author Dr. James Rossie, a paleontologist in the Department of Anthropology at Stony Brook University. Adalatherium hui had more foramina  holes that served as passageways for nerves and blood vessels supplying a very sensitive snout that was covered with whiskers  on its face than any known mammal. And there is one very large hole on the top of its snout for which there is just no parallel in any known mammal, living or extinct. The teeth of Adalatherium hui are vastly different in construction than any known mammal. Its backbone had more vertebrae than any Mesozoic mammal and one of its leg bones was strangely curved. According to the team, the plate tectonic history of Gondwana provides independent evidence for why this mammal is so bizarre. Adalatherium hui was found in rocks dated to near the end of the Cretaceous period, at 66 million years ago. Madagascar, with the Indian subcontinent attached to the east, separated from Africa over a hundred million years before and finally became isolated as an island in the Indian Ocean when the Indian subcontinent detached at approximately 88 million years ago and drifted northward, Dr. Krause said. That left the lineage that ultimately resulted in Adalatherium hui to evolve, isolated from mainland populations, for over 20 million years  ample time to develop its many ludicrous features. The discovery of Adalatherium hui is reported in a paper in the journal Nature.

About 100 million years ago, the so called Kem Kem beds were home to a vast river system, filled with many different species of aquatic and terrestrial animals. Fossils from this formation include three of the largest predatory dinosaurs ever known, including Carcharodontosaurus and Deltadromeus, as well as several pterosaurs and crocodile like hunters. This was arguably the most dangerous place in the history of planet Earth, a place where a human time traveler would not last very long, said Dr. Nizar Ibrahim, a researcher at the University of Detroit Mercy and the University of Portsmouth. Many of the predators were relying on an abundant supply of fish, added Professor David Martill, a scientist at the University of Portsmouth. This place was filled with absolutely enormous fish, including giant coelacanths and lungfish. The coelacanth, for example, is probably four or even five times large than todays coelacanth. There is an enormous freshwater saw shark called Onchopristis with the most fearsome of rostral teeth, they are like barbed daggers, but beautifully shiny. The paleontologists produced the first detailed and fully illustrated account of the Kem Kem beds. The researchers now define this sedimentary package as the Kem Kem Group, which consists of two distinct formations, the Gara Sbaa Formation and the Douira Formation.

"}, {"title": " Fossil Flyers Hold Secrets to Better Flight Technologies", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 18, 2020", "doc": "The physiology of pterosaurs and other fossil flyers could provide ancient solutions to modern flight problems, such as aerial stability and the ability of drones to self launch, according to a new paper published in the journal Trends in Ecology  Evolution. Theres a lot of really cool stuff in the fossil record that goes unexplored because engineers generally dont look to paleontology when thinking about inspiration for flight, said Dr. Liz Martin Silverstone, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bristol. If were only looking at modern animals for inspiration, were really missing a large degree of the morphology out there and ignoring a lot of options that I think could be useful. Previously, engineers have largely focused on the physiology of modern birds and insects when designing aeronautic technology like drones and planes. They might not think to examine fossils which are often incomplete. However, there are a select few pterosaur fossils that provide extraordinarily deep insight into the anatomy of their wings, which is essential for understanding their flight capabilities. There are two or three absolutely amazingly preserved pterosaur fossils that let you see the different layers within the wing membrane, giving us insight into its fibrous components, Dr. Martin Silverstone said. Also, some fossils are preserved enough to show the wing attachments beneath the hip. While you dont know exactly the shape of the wing, by knowing the membrane attachments you can model the effectiveness of different wing shapes and determine which would have performed best in natural conditions. Analyzing the morphology and predicted flight mechanics of these ancient creatures has revealed novel tactics that dont exist in modern flyers. Becoming airborne is one example. Launching into the air through a leap or jump, also known as ballistic launch, is standard throughout the animal kingdom. However, larger birds require a running start to gain enough momentum for lift off. Pterosaurs, on the other hand, may have developed a method to launch from a stationary position despite some specimens weighing nearly 300 kg. One hypothesis suggests that the wing membrane and robust muscle attachments in the wings allowed pterosaurs to generate a high powered leap off of their elbows and wrists, giving them enough height to become airborne. Today, something like a drone requires a flat surface to launch and is quite restricted on how it actually gets into the air, Dr. Martin Silverstone said. The unique launch physiology of pterosaurs might be able to help solve some of these problems. Pterosaurs can also provide insights on how to prevent flight instability once in the air. Contrary to how sails can become unstable in a strong wind, pterosaurs evolved strategies to resist flutter of their broad wings. So far weve struggled to design things like flight suits that can resist the pressures of flight. If we can understand how pterosaurs did it, for instance by understanding how their wing membrane was actually structured, then thats something we can use to answer modern engineering questions, Dr. Martin Silverstone said. These unique physiological elements arent limited to just pterosaurs, either. Other ancient flyers, such as Microraptor, had feathered wings on both their arms and legs, while a recently discovered dinosaur, Yi qi, had wings that combined feathers with a bat like membrane  a body plan that has never been repeated since their extinction. As such, many flight strategies remain to be properly explored. If we combine our knowledge from flyers both living and extinct, we will have a much better chance of overcoming the hurdles still hindering manmade flight, Dr. Martin Silverstone said. We want biologists and engineers alike to reach out to paleontologists when they are looking to solving flight problems, as there might be something extinct that could help. If we limit ourselves to looking at the modern animals, then were missing out on a lot of diversity that might be useful.

The clutch of seven subspherical dinosaur eggs was recovered from the Elliot Formation of Golden Gate Highlands National Park in South Africa in 1976. Two partially exposed embryos in the clutch were quickly identified as being dinosaurian, making them among the oldest known dinosaur eggs and embryos in the world. The fossilized eggs belong to Massospondylus carinatus, a 5 m long sauropodomorph dinosaur that lived approximately 200 million years ago Jurassic period. At the ESRF, an 844 m long ring of electrons traveling at the speed of light emits high powered X ray beams that can be used to non destructively scan matter, including fossils, the paleontologists explained. The embryos were scanned at an unprecedented level of detail  at the resolution of an individual bone cell. With these data in hand, they were able to create a 3D model of Massospondylus carinatus embryonic skull. No lab CT scanner in the world can generate these kinds of data. Only with a huge facility like the ESRF can we unlock the hidden potential of our most exciting fossils, said Dr. Vincent Fernandez, a scientist at the Natural History Museum in London, UK. The researchers noticed similarities between the dinosaur embryos and the developing embryos of crocodiles, chickens, turtles, and lizards. By comparing which bones of the dinosaur embryonic skull were present at different stages of their development, we can now show that the Massospondylus carinatus embryos were actually much younger than previously thought and were only at 60 through their incubation period, they said. We also found that each embryo had two types of teeth preserved in its developing jaws. One set was made up of very simple triangular teeth that would have been resorbed or shed before hatching, just like geckos and crocodiles today. The second set was very similar to that of adults, and would be the ones that the embryos hatched with. I was really surprised to find that these embryos not only had teeth, but had two types of teeth, said Dr. Kimi Chapelle, a researcher at the University of Witwatersrand. The teeth are so tiny they range from 0.4 to 0.7 mm wide. Thats smaller than the tip of a toothpick. The team concluded that dinosaurs developed in the egg just like their reptilian relatives, whose embryonic developmental pattern hasnt changed in 200 million years. Its incredible that in more than 250 million years of reptile evolution, the way the skull develops in the egg remains more or less the same. Goes to show  you dont mess with a good thing, said Professor Jonah Choiniere, also from the University of Witwatersrand. The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Most tapejarid pterosaurs had large, broad crests sweeping up from the front of the skull.

The mid Cretaceous period 115 million to 80 million years ago was the heyday of the dinosaurs but was also the warmest period in the past 140 million years, with temperatures in the tropics as high as 35 degrees Celsius and sea level 170 m higher than today. However, little was known about the environment south of the Antarctic Circle at this time. The preservation of this 90 million year old forest is exceptional, but even more surprising is the world it reveals, said Professor Tina van de Flierdt, a researcher in the Department of Earth Science  Engineering at Imperial College London. Even during months of darkness, swampy temperate rainforests were able to grow close to the South Pole, revealing an even warmer climate than we expected. The evidence for the Antarctic forest comes from a core of sediment drilled at the site of PS10420 2 73.57\u00b0S, 107.09\u00b0W 946 m water depth near the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers in West Antarctica. One section of the core, that would have originally been deposited on land, caught the scientists attention with its strange color. During the initial shipboard assessments, the unusual coloration of the sediment layer quickly caught our attention it clearly differed from the layers above it, said Dr. Johann Klages, a geologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research. The team CT scanned the section of the core and discovered an intact 3 m long network of fossil roots, which was so well preserved that they could make out individual cell structures. The 90 million year old sample also contained countless traces of pollen and spores from plants, including the first remnants of flowering plants ever found at these high Antarctic latitudes. The numerous plant remains indicate that 93 to 83 million years ago the coast of West Antarctica was a swampy landscape in which temperate rainforests grew  similar to the forests that can still be found, say, on New Zealands South Island, said Professor Ulrich Salzmann, a paleoecologist at Northumbria University. To reconstruct the environment of this preserved forest, the researchers assessed the climatic conditions under which the plants modern descendants live, as well as analyzing temperature and precipitation indicators within the sample. They found that the annual mean air temperature was around 12 degrees Celsius. Average summer temperatures were around 19 degrees Celsius water temperatures in the rivers and swamps reached up to 20 degrees. They conclude that 90 million years ago the Antarctic continent was covered with dense vegetation, there were no land ice masses on the scale of an ice sheet in the South Pole region, and the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere was far higher than previously assumed for the mid Cretaceous period. Before our study, the general assumption was that the global carbon dioxide concentration in the Cretaceous was roughly 1,000 ppm, Dr. Klages said. But in our model based experiments, it took concentration levels of 1,120 to 1,680 ppm to reach the average temperatures back then in the Antarctic.

Dineobellator notohesperus lived some 67 million years ago Cretaceous period in what is now New Mexico. Its partial skeleton was recovered from the Upper Cretaceous rocks of the San Juan Basin. The ancient predator stood only about 1 m 3.3 feet at the hip and was about 2 m 6.6 feet long  similar in size to famous dromaeosaurids Velociraptor and Saurornitholestes. While dromaeosaurids are better known from places like the northern United States, Canada, and Asia, little is known of the group farther south in North America, said Dr. Steven Jasinski, a paleontologist at the University of Pennsylvania, State Museum of Pennsylvania and the Don Sundquist Center of Excellence in Paleontology. While not all of Dineobellator notohesperus bones were recovered, bones from the forearm have quill nobs  small bumps on the surface where feathers would be anchored by ligaments  an indication that the dinosaur bore feathers in life, similar to those inferred for Velociraptor. Features of the animals forelimbs, including enlarged areas of the claws, suggest this dinosaur could strongly flex its arms and hands. This ability may have been useful for holding on to prey  using its hands for smaller animals such as birds and lizards, or perhaps its arms and feet for larger species such as other dinosaurs. Dineobellator notohesperus tail also possessed unique characteristics. While most dromaeosaurids tails were straight and stiffened with rod like structures, the tail of this dinosaur was rather flexible at its base, allowing the rest of the tail to remain stiff and act like a rudder. Think of what happens with a cats tail as it is running. While the tail itself remains straight, it is also whipping around constantly as the animal is changing direction, Dr. Jasinski said. A stiff tail that is highly mobile at its base allows for increased agility and changes in direction, and potentially aided Dineobellator notohesperus in pursuing prey, especially in more open habitats. Dineobellator notohesperus provides a clearer picture of the biology of North American dromaeosaurids, especially concerning the distribution of feathers among its members. As we find evidence of more members possessing feathers, we believe it is likely that all the dromaeosaurids had feathers, Dr. Jasinski said. The discovery also hints at some of the predatory habits of a group of iconic meat eating dinosaurs that lived just before the extinction event that killed off all the dinosaurs that werent birds. The discovery is reported in a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Pterosaurs were Earths first winged vertebrates, with birds and bats making their appearances much later. They thrived from about 210 to 65 million years ago, when they were wiped out by the asteroid that also doomed the non avian dinosaurs. Some pterosaurs, such as the giant azhdarchids, were the largest flying animals of all time, with wingspans exceeding 9.1 m 30 feet and standing heights comparable to modern giraffes. The three new specimens were obtained from fossil miners in a small village called Beggaa, just outside Erfoud in southeast Morocco. They are 100 million years old Cretaceous period, and belong to Anhanguera, Ornithocheirus and Coloborhynchus genera. Anhanguera was only known to be from Brazil. Ornithocheirus had until now only been found in England and Middle Asia. Their addition raises the total diversity of pterosaurs from the Kem Kem beds to at least nine species, including five ornithocheird pterosaurs and at least four azhdarchids. Pterosaur remains are very rare, with most known from Europe, South America and Asia, said studys lead author Megan Jacobs, a doctoral candidate at Baylor University. These new finds are very exciting and provide a window into the world of pterosaurs in Cretaceous Africa. Jacobs and colleagues found that these African pterosaurs were quite similar to those found on other continents. Their world included crocodile like hunters and carnivorous dinosaurs, with few herbivores. Many predators, including the toothed pterosaurs, preyed on a superabundance of fish. For such large animals, they would have weighed very little, Jacobs said. Their wingspans were around 3 to 4 m 10 13 feet, with their bones almost paper thin and full of air, very similar to birds. This allowed these awesome creatures to reach incredible sizes and still be able to take off and soar the skies. The study is published in the journal Cretaceous Research. "}, {"title": " Oldest Bilaterian Fossil Found in Australia", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 24, 2020", "doc": "Ikaria wariootia, a wormlike creature that lived more than 555 million years ago Ediacaran period in what is now Australia, is the earliest bilaterian, according to new research led by University of California, Riverside researcher Scott Evans. Bilaterians are animals with bilateral symmetry as an embryo, i.e. having a left and a right side that are mirror images of each other. They have a head and a tail as well as a back and a belly. The development of bilateral symmetry was a critical step in the evolution of animal life, giving organisms the ability to move purposefully and a common, yet successful way to organize their bodies. A multitude of animals, from worms to insects to dinosaurs to humans, are organized around this same basic bilaterian body plan. Evolutionary biologists studying the genetics of modern animals predicted the oldest ancestor of all bilaterians would have been simple and small, with rudimentary sensory organs. Preserving and identifying the fossilized remains of such an animal was thought to be difficult, if not impossible. For 15 years, paleontologists agreed that Helminthoidichnites, fossilized burrows found in Ediacaran period deposits in Nilpena, South Australia, were made by bilaterians. But there was no sign of the creature that made Helminthoidichnites types burrows, leaving scientists with nothing but speculation. Dr. Evans and colleagues noticed miniscule, oval impressions near some of these burrows. They used a 3D laser scanner that revealed the regular, consistent shape of a cylindrical body with a distinct head and tail and faintly grooved musculature. Dubbed Ikaria wariootia, the animal ranged between 2 7 mm long and about 1 2.5 mm wide, with the largest the size and shape of a grain of rice  just the right size to have made the burrows. We thought these animals should have existed during this interval, but always understood they would be difficult to recognize. Once we had the 3D scans, we knew that we had made an important discovery, Dr. Evans said. Burrows of Ikaria wariootia occur lower than anything else. Its the oldest fossil we get with this type of complexity, said University of California, Riversides Professor Mary Droser. Dickinsonia and other big things were probably evolutionary dead ends. We knew that we also had lots of little things and thought these might have been the early bilaterians that we were looking for. In spite of its relatively simple shape, Ikaria wariootia was complex compared to other fossils from this period. It burrowed in thin layers of well oxygenated sand on the ocean floor in search of organic matter, indicating rudimentary sensory abilities. The depth and curvature of Ikaria wariootia represent clearly distinct front and rear ends, supporting the directed movement found in the burrows. The burrows also preserve crosswise, V shaped ridges, suggesting Ikaria wariootia moved by contracting muscles across its body like a worm, known as peristaltic locomotion. Evidence of sediment displacement in the burrows and signs the organism fed on buried organic matter reveal Ikaria wariootia probably had a mouth, anus, and gut. This is what evolutionary biologists predicted. Its really exciting that what we have found lines up so neatly with their prediction, Professor Droser said. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

A detailed analysis of the skull shows that it combines landfowl  and waterfowl like features, suggesting that the bird is close to the last common ancestor of modern chickens and ducks. Nicknamed the Wonderchicken and scientifically named Asteriornis maastrichtensis, the prehistoric bird lived 66.75 million years ago Cretaceous period. Its fossilized remains were discovered in a limestone quarry near the Belgian Dutch border. The moment I first saw what was beneath the rock was the most exciting moment of my scientific career, said Dr. Daniel Field, an evolutionary paleobiologist in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge. This is one of the best preserved fossil bird skulls of any age, from anywhere in the world. We almost had to pinch ourselves when we saw it, knowing that it was from such an important time in Earths history. Finding the skull blew my mind. Without cutting edge CT scans, we never would have known that we were holding the oldest modern bird skull in the world, said co author Juan Benito, a researcher in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge and the Department of Biology  Biochemistry at the University of Bath.  The skull of Asteriornis maastrichtensis is clearly recognizable as a modern bird. It combines many features common to the group that includes living chickens and ducks  a group called Galloanserae. The origins of living bird diversity are shrouded in mystery  other than knowing that modern birds arose at some point towards the end of the age of dinosaurs, we have very little fossil evidence of them until after the asteroid hit, said co author and Ph.D. student Albert Chen, also from the University of Cambridge and the University of Bath. This fossil provides our earliest direct glimpse of what modern birds were like during the initial stages of their evolutionary history. The fact that Asteriornis maastrichtensis was found in Europe is another thing which makes it so extraordinary. The Late Cretaceous fossil record of birds from Europe is extremely sparse. The discovery of Asteriornis maastrichtensis provides some of the first evidence that Europe was a key area in the early evolutionary history of modern birds, said co author Dr. John Jagt, a researcher in the Natuurhistorische Museum Maastricht, the Netherlands. This fossil tells us that early on, at least some modern birds were fairly small bodied, ground dwelling birds that lived near the seashore. Asteriornis maastrichtensis now gives us a search image for future fossil discoveries  hopefully it ushers in a new era of fossil finds that help clarify how, when and where modern birds first evolved, Dr. Field added. The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal Nature.

The evolution of fishes into tetrapods  four legged vertebrates of which humans belong  was one of the most significant events in the history of life. Vertebrates were then able to leave the water and conquer land. In order to complete this transition  one of the most significant changes was the evolution of hands and feet. In order to understand the evolution from a fish fin to a tetrapod limb, paleontologists study the fossils of lobe finned fish and tetrapods from the Middle and Upper Devonian 393 359 million years ago known as elpistostegalians. These include the well known Tiktaalik roseae from Arctic Canada, known only from incomplete specimens. We announce the discovery of a complete specimen of a tetrapod like fish, called Elpistostege watsoni, which reveals extraordinary new information about the evolution of the vertebrate hand, said Flinders Universitys Professor John Long, senior author of the study. Professor Long and colleagues examined the 380 million year old specimen using the high energy computed tomography. The skeleton of Elpistostege watsonis pectoral fin revealed the presence of a humerus arm, radius and ulna forearm, rows of carpus wrist and phalanges organized in digits fingers. This is the first time that we have unequivocally discovered fingers locked in a fin with fin rays in any known fish, Professor Long said. The articulating digits in the fin are like the finger bones found in the hands of most animals. This finding pushes back the origin of digits in vertebrates to the fish level, and tells us that the patterning for the vertebrate hand was first developed deep in evolution, just before fishes left the water.  Over the past decade, fossils informing the fish to tetrapod transition have helped to better understand anatomical transformations associated with breathing, hearing, and feeding, as the habitat changed from water to land on Earth, said lead author Dr. Richard Cloutier, a researcher at the Universite du Quebec a Rimouski. The origin of digits relates to developing the capability for the fish to support its weight in shallow water or for short trips out on land. The increased number of small bones in the fin allows more planes of flexibility to spread out its weight through the fin. The other features the study revealed concerning the structure of the upper arm bone or humerus, which also shows features present that are shared with early amphibians. Elpistostege watsoni is not necessarily our ancestor, but it is closest we can get to a true transitional fossil, an intermediate between fishes and tetrapods. The study is published in the journal Nature.

Skye is one of the few places in the world were fossils from the Middle Jurassic epoch can be found. Discoveries on the island have provided paleontologists with vital clues about the early evolution of major dinosaur groups, including huge, long necked sauropods and fierce, meat eating cousins of Tyrannosaurus rex. In a new paper published in the journal PLoS ONE, a team of researchers from the UK and Brazil reports 50 new dinosaur tracks from two tracksites at Rubha nam Brathairean Brothers Point. They include the first record on the Isle of Skye of a track type called Deltapodus, most likely created by a stegosaurian dinosaur. These are the oldest Deltapodus tracks known, and the first strong evidence that stegosaurian dinosaurs were part of the islands Middle Jurassic fauna. Additionally, three toed footprints represent multiple sizes of early carnivorous theropods and a series of other large tracks are tentatively identified as some of the oldest evidence of large bodied herbivorous ornithopod dinosaurs. These new tracksites help us get a better sense of the variety of dinosaurs that lived near the coast of Skye during the Middle Jurassic than what we can glean from the islands body fossil record, said lead author Paige dePolo, a Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh. In particular, Deltapodus tracks give good evidence that stegosaurs lived on Skye at this time. Our findings give us a much clearer picture of the dinosaurs that lived in Scotland 170 million years ago, said University of Edinburghs Dr. Steve Brusatte, co author and leader of the field team. We knew there were giant long necked sauropods and jeep sized carnivores, but we can now add plate backed stegosaurs to that roster, and maybe even primitive cousins of the duck billed dinosaurs too. These discoveries are making Skye one of the best places in the world for understanding dinosaur evolution in the Middle Jurassic.

The newly identified species, named Oculudentavis khaungraae, could represent the smallest known Mesozoic dinosaur in the fossil record. Its size is on par with that of the bee hummingbird Mellisuga helenae, the smallest living bird. Amber preservation of vertebrates is rare, and this provides us a window into the world of dinosaurs at the lowest end of the body size spectrum, said Dr. Lars Schmitz, a researcher in the W. M. Keck Science Department at Claremont McKenna, Scripps and Pitzer Colleges. Its unique anatomical features point to one of the smallest and most ancient birds ever found. The piece of amber, just 31 x 20 x 8.5 mm, containing the skull of Oculudentavis khaungraae came from the Angbamo site near Tanai in the Hukawng valley of Myanmars Kachin province. Dr. Schmitz and colleagues studied the specimens distinct features with high resolution synchrotron scans to determine how the skull differs from those of other bird like dinosaur specimens. They found that the shape and size of the eye bones suggested a diurnal lifestyle, but also revealed surprising similarities to the eyes of modern lizards. The skull also shows a unique pattern of fusion between different bone elements, as well as the presence of teeth. The specimens tiny size and unusual form suggests a never before seen combination of features, the scientists said. The discovery represents a specimen previously missing from the fossil record and provides new implications for understanding the evolution of birds, demonstrating the extreme miniaturization of avian body sizes early in the evolutionary process. The specimens preservation also highlights amber deposits potential to reveal the lowest limits of vertebrate body size. No other group of living birds features species with similarly small crania in adults, Dr. Schmitz said. This discovery shows us that we have only a small glimpse of what tiny vertebrates looked like in the age of the dinosaurs. The findings are published in the journal Nature. "}, {"title": " Study: 70 Million Years Ago Day Lasted 23.5 Hours, Year Had 372 Days", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 10, 2020", "doc": "Torreites sanchezi, an extinct species of rudist clam that lived during the Cretaceous period, some 70 million years ago, grew fast, laying down daily growth rings. In a new study, a team of researchers from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and Ghent University used lasers to sample minute slices of Torreites sanchezis shell and count the growth rings. The rings allowed the scientists to determine the number of days in a year and more accurately calculate the length of a day 70 million years ago. The new measurement also informs models of how the Moon formed and how close to Earth it has been over the 4.5 billion year history of the Earth Moon gravitational dance. Torreites sanchezi mollusks look like tall pint glasses with lids shaped like bear claw pastries. They had two shells, or valves, that met in a hinge, like asymmetrical clams, and grew in dense reefs, like modern oysters. They thrived in water several degrees warmer worldwide than modern oceans. In the Late Cretaceous epoch, rudists like Torreites sanchezi dominated the reef building niche in tropical waters around the world, filling the role held by corals today. They disappeared in the same event that killed the non avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Rudists are quite special bivalves. Theres nothing like it living today, said Dr. Niels de Winter, an analytical geochemist at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. In the Late Cretaceous epoch especially, worldwide most of the reef builders are these bivalves. So they really took on the ecosystem building role that the corals have nowadays. Dr. de Winter and colleagues analyzed a single individual of Torreites sanchezi that lived for over nine years in a shallow seabed in the tropics  a location which is now dry land in the mountains of Oman. We have about four to five datapoints per day, and this is something that you almost never get in geological history. We can basically look at a day 70 million years ago. Its pretty amazing, Dr. de Winter said. The teams method focused a laser on small bits of shell, making holes 10 micrometers in diameter, or about as wide as a red blood cell. Trace elements in these tiny samples reveal information about the temperature and chemistry of the water at the time the shell formed. The analysis provided accurate measurements of the width and number of daily growth rings as well as seasonal patterns. The researchers used seasonal variations in the fossilized shell to identify years. They found the composition of the shell changed more over the course of a day than over seasons, or with the cycles of ocean tides. The fine scale resolution of the daily layers shows the shell grew much faster during the day than at night. This bivalve had a very strong dependence on this daily cycle, which suggests that it had photosymbionts. You have the day night rhythm of the light being recorded in the shell, Dr. de Winter said. This result suggests daylight was more important to the lifestyle of the ancient mollusk than might be expected if it fed itself primarily by filtering food from the water, like modern day clams and oysters. The mollusks likely had a relationship with an indwelling symbiotic species that fed on sunlight, similar to living giant clams, which harbor symbiotic algae. Until now, all published arguments for photosymbiosis in rudists have been essentially speculative, based on merely suggestive morphological traits, and in some cases were demonstrably erroneous. This paper is the first to provide convincing evidence in favor of the hypothesis, said Dr. Peter Skelton, a retired lecturer of paleobiology at the Open University and a rudist expert unaffiliated with the new study. The scientists also found that ocean temperatures were warmer in the Late Cretaceous epoch than previously appreciated, reaching 40 degrees Celsius 104 degrees Fahrenheit in summer and exceeding 30 degrees Celsius 86 degrees Fahrenheit in winter. The summer high temperatures likely approached the physiological limits for mollusks, Dr. de Winter said. The teams careful count of the number of daily layers found 372 for each yearly interval. This was not a surprise, because scientists know days were shorter in the past. The result is, however, the most accurate now available for the Late Cretaceous epoch, and has a surprising application to modeling the evolution of the Earth Moon system. The length of a year has been constant over Earths history, because Earths orbit around the Sun does not change. But the number of days within a year has been shortening over time because days have been growing longer. The length of a day has been growing steadily longer as friction from ocean tides, caused by the Moons gravity, slows Earths rotation. The pull of the tides accelerates the Moon a little in its orbit, so as Earths spin slows, the Moon moves farther away. The Moon is pulling away from Earth at 3.82 cm 1.5 inches per year. Precise laser measurements of distance to the Moon from Earth have demonstrated this increasing distance since the Apollo program left helpful reflectors on the Moons surface. But scientists conclude the Moon could not have been receding at this rate throughout its history, because projecting its progress linearly back in time would put the Moon inside the Earth only 1.4 billion years ago. Scientists know from other evidence that the Moon has been with us much longer, most likely coalescing in the wake of a massive collision early in Earths history, over 4.5 billion years ago. So the Moons rate of retreat has changed over time, and information from the past, like a year in the life of an ancient clam, helps researchers reconstruct that history and model of the formation of the Moon. Because in the history of the Moon, 70 million years is a blink in time, Dr. de Winter and co authors hope to apply their new method to older fossils and catch snapshots of days even deeper in time. Their findings appear in the journal Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology.

Dubbed Uintan paraortygid, the ancient bird lived some 44 million years ago during the Eocene period. It belongs to an extinct group called Paraortygidae, a relative of the living Galliformes  the group that includes the living chicken, turkey, guineafowl, and quail. It fits in a nearly 15 million year gap in the fossil record of the galliform lineage in North America. Uintan paraortygid is similar in size to the smallest living Galliformes like quail and hill partridges, said Dr. Thomas Stidham, a paleontologist in the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and colleagues. It likely lived before the evolution of the large crop and gizzard that we see in living chickens and turkeys, and therefore the Utah species likely had a diet different from its living relatives. The earliest fossils of this paraortygid group are from arid habitats, the seashore, and inland forests demonstrating that they had flexibility in their ecology and diet. Another interesting aspect of Uintan paraortygid is that it closely resembles the small size and unique shape of other early paraortygid fossils from sediments with a similar geological age from Namibia in southern Africa and Uzbekistan in Central Asia which were all separated from each other by oceans. The paraortygid fossils from Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America show that the group was very widely dispersed early in their evolution and crossed oceans in order to be so widely spread, the researchers said. A distinct tiny bone from the shoulder girdle of Uintan paraortygid was collected from the Uinta Formation in the Uinta Basin of Utah. The new Uinta bird fills not only a time gap, but also helps us better understand the animal community at this time, said Dr. Beth Townsend, a scientist at Midwestern University. The Uinta Basin is important for understanding ecosystems during times of global warm temperatures, when forests, primates, and early horses were spread across an area that is now desert. The discovery of this new paraortygid shows us that small ground dwelling birds were part of these ancient forests and may have competed with early mammals for resources. Even tiny incomplete fossils can provide the data to link global scientific questions together, Dr. Stidham added. The findings were published in the journal Diversity. "}, {"title": " Scientists Find Chemical Markers of DNA in Calcified Cartilage of Duck-Billed Dinosaur", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 3, 2020", "doc": "In the 1980s, paleontologists found a dinosaur nesting ground with dozens of nestlings in northern Montana and identified them as Hypacrosaurus stebingeri, a species of herbivorous duck billed dinosaur that lived some 75 million years ago Cretaceous period. Now, a team of researchers from the United States, Canada, and China has investigated molecular preservation of calcified cartilage in one of the Hypacrosaurus stebingeri nestlings at the extracellular, cellular and intracellular levels. Theyve found chemical markers of DNA, preserved fragments of proteins and chromosomes in the dinosaur chondrocytes cartilage cells. The findings further support the idea that these original molecules can persist for tens of millions of years. The skull bones of baby dinosaurs are not fused when they hatch, but instead, some of them have cartilaginous plates that fuse later as bone forms in the spaces between them, said Dr. Alida Bailleul, a paleontologist in the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology and the Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Seeing exquisitely preserved microscopic structures that resembled the specific cell types found only in cartilage, and which would have been present in the living organism in these tissues, led us to hypothesize that cellular preservation may have extended to the molecular level. Dr. Bailleul and colleagues performed immunological and histochemical analyses of tissues from the skull of the Hypacrosaurus stebingeri hatchling and compared the results to those from an emu skull at a similar stage of development. Bird skulls ossify, or harden, in the same pattern as this hadrosaurs skull would have, and primitive birds ratites like emus are the closest relatives we have alive today to non avian dinosaurs, said Professor Mary Schweitzer, a researcher at North Carolina State University, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and the University of Lund. The cartilaginous tissues and chondrocytes from the dinosaur skull reacted with antibodies to collagen II, but the surrounding bone did not react with collagen II antibodies. This is significant because collagen II is found only in cartilage, while collagen I dominates in bone. Comparing the results to the emu confirmed the findings. These tests show how specific the antibodies are to each type of protein, and support the presence of collagen II in these tissues, Professor Schweitzer said. Additionally, bacteria cannot produce collagen, which rules out contamination as the source of the molecules. The scientists also tested the microstructures for the presence of chemical markers consistent with DNA using two complementary histochemical stains that bind to DNA fragments within cells 4\u2032,6\u2032 diamidino 2 phenylindole dihydrochloride and propidium iodide. These chemical markers reacted with isolated cartilaginous cells, supporting the idea that some fragmentary DNA may remain within the cells. We used two different kinds of intercalating stains, one of which will only attach to DNA fragments in dead cells, and the other which binds to any DNA, Professor Schweitzer said. The stains show point reactivity, meaning they are binding to specific molecules within the microstructure and not smeared across the entire cell as would be expected if they arose from bacterial contamination. Although bone cells have previously been isolated from dinosaur bone, this is the first time that cartilage producing cells have been isolated from a fossil, Dr. Bailleul said. Its an exciting find that adds to the growing body of evidence that these tissues, cells and nuclear material can persist for millions  even tens of millions  of years. The findings were published in the journal National Science Review. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Solve Mystery of Cambrian Worm-Like Creature", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Feb 28, 2020", "doc": "An enigmatic worm like animal called Facivermis yunnanicus lost lower limbs for tube dwelling lifestyle, according to new research published in the journal Current Biology. Facivermis yunnanicus lived some 518 million years ago in the Cambrian period. It had a long body and five pairs of spiny arms near its head, leading to suggestions it might be a missing link between legless cycloneuralian worms and a group of fossil animals called lobopodians, which had paired limbs all along their bodies. But the new study reveals the creature was itself a lobopodian that lived a tube dwelling lifestyle anchored on the sea floor, and so evolved to lose its lower limbs. A key piece of evidence was a fossil in which the lower portion of Facivermis yunnanicus was surrounded by a tube, said Dr. Richard Howard, a researcher at Yunnan University, the University of Exeter, and the Natural History Museum, London. We dont know the nature of the tube itself, but it shows the lower portion of the worm was anchored inside by a swollen rear end. Living like this, its lower limbs would not have been useful, and over time the species ceased to have them. Most of its relatives had three to nine sets of lower legs for walking, but our findings suggest Facivermis yunnanicus remained in place and used its upper limbs to filter food from the water. This is the earliest known example of secondary loss  seen today in cases such as the loss of legs in snakes. The Cambrian period is seen as the dawn of animal life, and the scientists were fascinated to find a species evolving to be more primitive even at this early stage of evolution. We generally view organisms evolving from simple to more complex body plans, but occasionally we see the opposite occurring, said Dr. Xiaoya Ma, a researcher at Yunnan University and the University of Exeter. What excited us in this study is that even at this early stage of animal evolution, secondary loss modifications  and in this case, reverting back to lose some of its legs  had already occurred. Weve known about this species for about 30 years, but its only now that weve got a confident grasp of where it fits in the evolutionary tree. Studies like this help us understand the shape of the tree of life and figure out where the adaptations and body parts we now see have come from. For several years we and others have been finding lobopodians from the Cambrian period with pairs of appendages along the length of the body  long, grasping ones in the front, and shorter, clawed ones in the back, said Dr. Greg Edgecombe, from the Natural History Museum. But Facivermis yunnanicus takes this to the extreme, by completely reducing the posterior batch. "}, {"title": " Lizard Forefoot Found Preserved in Dominican Amber", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Feb 28, 2020", "doc": "The left forelimb of an anole lizard genus Anolis has been found perfectly preserved in a piece of Miocene period amber from the Dominican Republic. Vertebrate inclusions in amber are very rare, the majority are insect fossils, said Jonas Barthel, a doctoral student in the Institute for Geosciences at the University of Bonn. Barthel and colleagues found the left forelimb of the Anolis lizard in a 2 cm piece of 15 20 million year old Dominican amber. The claws and toes are very clearly visible in the honey brown amber mass, almost as if the tree resin had only recently dripped onto them  yet the tiny foot is about 15 to 20 million years old, they said. The researchers examined the specimen by micro Raman spectroscopy, electron microprobe, and time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy. The analyses revealed that the forefoot is broken in two places and that one of the fractures is surrounded by a slight swelling. We propose the following model for our observations, the scientists said. While climbing the tree, the lizard got into contact with a flow of resin and could not escape its sticky trap. After some time, it attracted the attention of a predator that ripped off the lizard, leaving solely the fore limb in the resin. Later on, the resin hardened and became deposited within the surrounding soil which represents the starting point of its diagenesis. The presence of Schlauben a succession of flows, the splintered humerus, the edema, the peeled off parts of the skin, and lastly the numerous air bubbles strongly support this model. The Raman spectroscopy revealed that mineral hydroxyapatite in the bone had been transformed into fluoroapatite by the penetration of fluorine. This is surprising, because we assumed that the surrounding amber largely protects the fossil from environmental influences, Barthel said. However, the small crack may have encouraged chemical transformation by allowing mineral rich solutions to find their way in. The Raman spectroscopy also showed that collagen  the bones elastic component  had largely degraded. Despite the seemingly very good state of preservation, there was actually very little left of the original tissue structure. We have to expect that at least in amber from the Dominican Republic, macromolecules are no longer detectable, said Professor Jes Rust, also from the Institute for Geosciences at the University of Bonn. It was not possible to detect more complex molecules such as proteins, but the final analyses are still pending. The degradation processes in this amber deposit are therefore very advanced, and there is very little left of the original substance. The findings were published in the journal PLoS ONE.

The discovery of fossilized plant gum is unusual because of its solubility in water. A wide variety of plants produce fluid exudates e.g. resins and gums, with each group differing in chemical definitions. Due to similarity in physical appearance distinguishing exudates based on chemistry is vital, for example gums and resins are visually similar resulting in these terms being used interchangeably. However, their chemical definitions are very different resins are composed of lipid soluble terpenoids, while gums are complex, highly branched non starch water soluble polysaccharides. Differences between gum and resin can also be seen in the functional roles within the plant. The main roles of resins are to respond to wounding, as a defense against pathogens and to dissuade herbivory by insects and other organisms. Gum is involved in food storage, structural support, and also for wound sealing, but there is no common role across species. Further confusion arises as some plants, e.g. Boswellia and Commiphora species, even produce exudates with a mixture of polysaccharide and resin components the gum resins myrrh and frankincense, respectively. Until now only fossilized plant resin ambers and latex filaments have been reported preserved in the fossil record. While the fossilization of fluid exudates might seem unlikely, the fossilization of resin is relatively common, and extends back some 320 million years to the Carboniferous period, but chemically confirmed gums have never been reported. Our discovery overturns the basic assumption that plant gums cannot be preserved in the fossil record, said lead author Dr. Emily Roberts, a researcher in the School of the Environment, Geography and Geosciences at the University of Portsmouth and the Department of Palaeontology at the University of Vienna. It has opened our eyes to the fact that other plant chemicals may also be preserved  we can no longer just make assumptions. When we first tested the gum I was astonished that we were confirming something that was thought to be impossible  it just goes to show that fossil plants can surprise us. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy FTIR and attenuated total reflectance ATR spectroscopy, Dr. Roberts and colleagues analyzed the amber colored substance inside Welwitschiophyllum brasiliense leaves from Crato Formation, Brazil. The chemical spectrum of this substance clearly differed from those of ambers and resins, but resembled spectra of plant gum. Welwitschiophyllum brasiliense is considered a relative of Welwitschia mirabilis, one of the oldest and most enigmatic plants in existence. Today, Welwitschia mirabilis can be found only in the Namib Desert in Namibia and Southern Angola and has chemically confirmed gum in both the cone and in abaxial ducts within leaves. Our findings confirm that the Welwitschia mirabilis plant found in Africa today produces a gum similar to a plant growing 110 million years ago in Brazil, said co author Professor David Martill, also from the School of the Environmental Geography and Geosciences at the University of Portsmouth. Welwitschia mirabilis is one of lifes survivors, thriving in one of the harshest environments on earth for over 120 million years. This discovery is extremely exciting, especially when put into the context of these two continents of Africa and South America, being one during the Cretaceous period. The results were published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The microfossils are approximately one billion years old. They represent a previously unknown species of green seaweed, named Proterocladus antiquus, and are barely visible to the naked eyed at 2 mm in length, or roughly the size of a typical flea. These new fossils suggest that green seaweeds were important players in the ocean long before their land plant descendants moved and took control of dry land, said senior author Professor Shuhai Xiao, a researcher in the Department of Geosciences and Global Change Center at Virginia Tech. The entire biosphere is largely dependent on plants and algae for food and oxygen, yet land plants did not evolve until about 450 million years ago. Our study shows that green seaweeds evolved no later than one billion years ago, pushing back the record of green seaweeds by about 200 million years. What kind of seaweeds supplied food to the marine ecosystem. The current hypothesis is that land plants  the trees, grasses, food crops, bushes, even kudzu  evolved from green seaweeds, which were aquatic plants. Through geological time they moved out of the water and became adapted to and prospered on dry land, their new natural environment. These fossils are related to the ancestors of all the modern land plants we see today, Professor Xiao said. However, the caveat that not all geobiologists are on the same page  that debate on the origins of green plants remains. Not everyone agrees with us some scientists think that green plants started in rivers and lakes, and then conquered the ocean and land later. There are three main types of seaweed brown Phaeophyceae, green Chlorophyta, and red Rhodophyta, and thousands of species of each kind. Fossils of red seaweed, which are now common on ocean floors, have been dated as far back as 1.047 billion years old. There are some modern green seaweeds that look very similar to the fossils that we found, Professor Xiao said. A group of modern green seaweeds, known as siphonocladaleans, are particularly similar in shape and size to the fossils we found. Photosynthetic plants are, of course, vital to the ecological balance of the planet because they produce organic carbon and oxygen through photosynthesis, and they provide food and the basis of shelter for untold numbers of mammals, fish, and more. Yet, going back 2 billion years, Earth had no green plants at all in oceans, Professor Xiao said. Proterocladus antiquus seaweeds display multiple branches, upright growths, and specialized cells known as akinetes that are very common in this type of fossil, said lead author Dr. Qing Tang, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Geosciences and Global Change Center at Virginia Tech. Taken together, these features strongly suggest that the fossil is a green seaweed with complex multicellularity that is circa one billion years old. These likely represent the earliest fossil of green seaweeds. In short, our study tells us that the ubiquitous green plants we see today can be traced back to at least one billion years. The discovery is described in a paper in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution.

The newly discovered species belongs to Tettigarctidae, a family of hairy cicadas that includes only two extant species Tettigarcta crinita and Tettigarcta tomentosa. The single fossilized forewing of the prehistoric incest was collected from the Redmond no. 1 mine near Schefferville  the so called Redmond Formation  in Labrador, Canada. Dubbed Maculaferrum blaisi, the species is the first hemipteran insect true bug to be discovered at the Redmond Formation. A single wing was sufficient to identify the family to which the insect belonged, said Alexandre Demers Potvin, a Masters student at McGill University. We were easily able to demonstrate that the insect belonged to the Tettigarctidae family thanks to the pattern of the veins we observed on its wing. This gives us a better understanding of the sites insect biodiversity during the Cretaceous period, a time before the dinosaurs were wiped out, he said. The finding also illustrates that rare species can be found at the Redmond mine and that it deserves the attention from the paleontological community. The discovery of Maculaferrum blaisi confirms the presence of the once widespread family Tettigarctidae in North America and contributes to filling a Late Cretaceous gap in the fossil record of hairy cicadas. The find is exciting because it represents the oldest, diverse insect locality in Canada, said Professor Hans Larsson, Director of the Redpath Museum at McGill University. Its also from an exciting time during an evolutionary explosion of flowering plants and pollinating insects, that evolved into the terrestrial ecosystems of today.

Horned larks Eremophila alpestris. Permafrost deposits containing both animal and plant material represent a unique opportunity to reconstruct paleoenvironments. In recent years, permafrost sites in the Arctic have revealed a wealth of frozen animal carcasses from the last Ice Age, including mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, horses, bisons, and wolverines. These remains are of great interest to paleontology since they enable a better understanding of the impact of climate change on species, populations, and communities. In 2018, the frozen near complete carcass of a passerine bird was recovered in permafrost from a site 30\u2009km 18.6 miles east from the village of Belaya Gora in Yakutia. Dr. Nicolas Dussex, a scientist at Stockholm University, the Swedish Museum of Natural History and the Centre for Palaeogenetics, and his colleagues dated the specimen to 46,000 years old. The researchers then used 50\u2009mg of the bird tissue for DNA extraction and genome sequencing. They reconstructed the birds mitogenome and extracted a partial COI gene, which is used for species identification. They searched for matches with this gene in GenBank avian genetic databases and found a 100 identity match with the horned lark Eremophila alpestris, a species of lark in the Alaudidae family found across the northern hemisphere. Not only can we identify the bird as a horned lark, Dr. Dussex said. The genetic analysis also suggests that the bird belonged to a population that was a joint ancestor of two sub species of horned lark living today, one in Siberia, and one in the steppe in Mongolia. This helps us understand how the diversity of subspecies evolves. During the last Ice Age, the steppe spread out over northern Europe and Asia and was home to now extinct species such as the woolly mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros. According to one theory, this ecosystem was a mosaic of habitats like such as steppe, tundra and coniferous forest. At the end of the Ice Age, the steppe was divided into the biotopes we know today  tundra in the north, taiga in the middle and steppe in the south. Our results support this theory since the diversification of the horned lark into these sub species seems to have happened about at the same time as the mammoth steppe disappeared, said Professor Love Dal\u00e9n, also from Stockholm University, the Swedish Museum of Natural History and the Centre for Palaeogenetics.

Dinosaurs sit at an evolutionary point between birds, which are warm blooded, and reptiles, which are cold blooded, said Dr. Robin Dawson, a researcher in the Department of Geology and Geophysics at Yale University. Our results suggest that all major groups of dinosaurs had warmer body temperatures than their environment. Dr. Dawson and colleagues applied their novel method to the eggshells of three major groups of dinosaurs Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, and Theropoda. Clumped isotope paleothermometry is based on the fact that the ordering of oxygen and carbon atoms in a fossil eggshell are determined by temperature, they explained. Once you know the ordering of those atoms, you can calculate the mother dinosaurs internal body temperature. For example, eggshells of a Troodon, a small, meat eating theropod, tested at 38 degrees, 27 degrees, and 28 degrees Celsius or 100.4, 80.6, and 82.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Eggshells from the large, duck billed dinosaur Maiasaura yielded a temperature of 44 degrees Celsius 111.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Both the Troodon and Maiasaura eggshells were from Alberta, Canada. Meanwhile, fossilized dinosaur eggs from the oospecies  a species classification limited to dinosaur eggs  Megaloolithus, from Romania, tested at 36 degrees Celsius 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit. The scientists conducted the same analysis on cold blooded invertebrate shells in the same locations as the dinosaur eggshells. This helped the team determine the temperature of the local environment  and whether dinosaur body temperatures were higher or lower. The Troodon samples were as much as 10 degrees Celsius 18 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than their environment, the Maiasaura samples were 15 degrees Celsius warmer 27 degrees Fahrenheit, and the Megaloolithus samples were 3 6 degrees Celsius 5.4 10.8 degrees Fahrenheit warmer, Dr. Dawson said. What we found indicates that the ability to metabolically raise their temperatures above the environment was an early, evolved trait for dinosaurs. The results are published in the journal Science Advances.

Together, the fossils shed new light on the biology, past distribution, and phylogenetic position of the gigantic turtle. Since the extinction of dinosaurs, the northern Neotropics have harbored now extinct vertebrates that have been at the extreme of large size within their respective clades, said team leader Dr. Marcelo S\u00e1nchez, director of the Paleontological Institute and Museum at the University of Zurich, and colleagues. Among them are the largest snake, caimanine crocodile, gharial, and some of the largest rodents. One of the most iconic of these species is the gigantic turtle Stupendemys geographicus, as it is the largest non marine turtle ever known from a complete shell. Stupendemys geographicus was first described in 1976 from the Urumaco Formation in northwestern Venezuela, but our knowledge of this animal has been based on partial specimens that have resulted in a problematic taxonomy, especially due to a lack of specimens with associated skull and shell elements. Dr. S\u00e1nchez and co authors unearthed and examined new specimens of Stupendemys geographicus in the Urumaco region in Venezuela and La Tatacoa Desert in Colombia. The finds included the largest shell reported for any extant or extinct turtle, with a carapace length of 2.4 m 8 feet and estimated mass of 1.145 kg, almost 100 times the size of its closest living relative. The carapace of some Stupendemys geographicus individuals reached almost 3 m 10 feet, making it one of the largest, if not the largest turtle that ever existed, Dr. S\u00e1nchez said. In some specimens, the researchers observed a peculiar and unexpected feature horns. The two shell types indicate that two sexes of Stupendemys geographicus existed males with horned shells and females with hornless shells, Dr. S\u00e1nchez said. This is the first time that sexual dimorphism in the form of horned shells has been reported for any of the side necked turtles, one of the two major groups of turtles world wide. The scientists were also able to revise the evolutionary relationships of this species within the turtle tree of life. Based on studies of the turtle anatomy, we now know that some living turtles from the Amazon region are the closest living relatives, Dr. S\u00e1nchez said. Furthermore, the new discoveries and the investigation of existing fossils from Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela indicate a much wider geographic distribution of Stupendemys geographicus than previously assumed. The animal lived across the whole of the northern part of South America. Despite its tremendous size, the turtle had natural enemies, the authors added. In many areas, the occurrence of Stupendemys geographicus coincides with Purussaurus, the largest caimans. This was most likely a predator of the giant turtle, given not only its size and dietary preferences, but also as inferred by bite marks and punctured bones in fossil carapaces of Stupendemys geographicus. The research is described in a paper in the journal Science Advances.

Tralkasaurus cuyi lived approximately 90 million years ago in what is now Patagonia, Argentina. It belongs to Abelisauridae, a group of ceratosaurian theropod dinosaurs that thrived during the Cretaceous period on the supercontinent Gondwana. The incomplete fossilized skeleton of Tralkasaurus cuyi, including a jaw and vertebra, were discovered at the Violante Farm fossil site in R\u00edo Negro province, northern Patagonia. The materials found are diagnostic to describe this new species the maxillary bone, that is part of the snout, was found from the skull and it still preserves some teeth, said Dr. Cerroni, the lead author of a paper published in the Journal of South American Earth Sciences. As for the rest of the skeleton, cervical ribs were found, which come out from the neck and are very long, so it is thought that they are tendons that have fossilized in addition, part of the hip and tail spine were found.  Tralkasaurus cuyi was about 4 m 13 feet long, smaller than previously known species of abelisaurid dinosaurs. The size of Tralkasaurus cuyi contrasts with that of typical abelisaurids such as Abelisaurus and Carnotaurus between 7 and 11 m, or 23 36 feet long, indicating that it would occupy a different ecological niche, the paleontologists said. Although its size is very small compared to Tyrannosaurus or Carnotaurus, the newly discovered dinosaur shares with them the characteristics of being a biped animal, short necked and muscular, with four claws in each of its hind legs, while its arms were also very short in relation to its body and the bones of its limbs were light and hollow, Dr. Cerroni said. The snout of this new species has a lot of ornamentation, that is, an outer surface marked by roughness a characteristic of the snout of these carnivores, which makes us assume that, in instead of having horns like Carnotaurus, it could have had small or poorly developed corneal structures, said team member Dr. Federico Agnolin, a researcher at the Argentine Museum of Natural Sciences, CONICET, and the Universidad Maimonides. Tralkasaurus cuyi likely preyed upon small animals which would likely include small herbivorous dinosaurs known as iguanadontians, turtles and lizards.

Bees are an important component in the evolutionary history and diversification of flowering plants angiosperms. The great majority of bees depend on pollen, nectar, oils, waxes, scents and resins from flowering plants for adult and larval nutrition, sexual attractants and nest construction. Bees evolved from apoid wasps, which are carnivores. Not much is known, however, about the changes wasps underwent as they made that dietary transition. The newly described primitive bee is so unique that Professor Poinar decided to establish a new genus and family Discoscapidae for it. Named Discoscapa apicula, the ancient insect is a small, black, mostly hairless, pollen collecting bee. It shares traits with modern bees  including plumose hairs, a rounded pronotal lobe, and a pair of spurs on the hind tibia  and also those of apoid wasps, such as very low placed antennal sockets and certain wing vein features. Something unique about the new family thats not found on any extant or extinct lineage of apoid wasps or bees is a bifurcated scape, Professor Poinar said. The fossil record of bees is pretty vast, but most are from the last 65 million years and look a lot like modern bees. Fossils like the one in this study can tell us about the changes certain wasp lineages underwent as they became palynivores  pollen eaters. The single female specimen of Discoscapa apicula is positioned at the edge of a small piece of amber. The specimen, which was obtained from a mine first excavated in 2001, in the Hukawng Valley, southwest of Maingkhwan in Kachin State in Myanmar, contains beetle parasites. Pollen grains on its legs show that the bee had recently visited one or more flowers. Additional evidence that the fossil bee had visited flowers are the 21 beetle triungulins  larvae  in the same piece of amber that were hitching a ride back to the bees nest to dine on bee larvae and their provisions, food left by the female, Professor Poinar said. It is certainly possible that the large number of triungulins caused the bee to accidentally fly into the resin.

We are thrilled to announce the first new species of tyrannosaur to be discovered in Canada in 50 years, said Dr. Fran\u00e7ois Therrien, curator of dinosaur paleoecology at the Royal Tyrrell Museum. The last tyrannosaur described from Canada was Daspletosaurus in 1970. The newly identified species was approximately 8 m long 26.2 feet and likely preyed on large plant eating dinosaurs, such as the horned Xenoceratops and the dome headed Colepiochephale. Dubbed Thanatotheristes degrootorum, the ancient creature is the oldest tyrannosaur known from Canada and northern North America. This is the oldest occurrence of a large tyrannosaur in Canada, found in an older window of time than where previous tyrannosaurs have been found, said Dr. Darla Zelenitsky, a dinosaur researcher at the University of Calgary. With this new species, we now know that tyrannosaurs were present in Alberta prior to 77 million years ago, the age of the next oldest tyrannosaur, Dr. Therrien added. We can tell from the skull how Thanatotheristes degrootorum is related to the other, better known tyrannosaurs from Alberta. A partial skull and the upper and lower jaw bones of the new tyrannosaur were found by farmers and paleontology enthusiasts John and Sandra De Groot in 2010 near the town of Hays. The jawbone was an absolutely stunning find. We knew it was special because you could clearly see the fossilized teeth, John De Groot said. John always said that one day he would find a dinosaur skull. Finding the jaw was exciting. Hearing that it is a new species, and seeing it given our family name, was beyond belief, added Sandra De Groot. The paleontologists found features of Thanatotheristes degrootorums skull that had not been seen before in other tyrannosaurs. The fossil has several physical features, including ridges along the upper jaw, which clearly distinguishes it as being from a new species. The diagnostic evidence showed that Thanatotheristes degrootorum is a close relative of two other well known tyrannosaur species, Daspletosaurus torosus and Daspletosaurus horneri. All three species form a newly named group of dinosaurs called Daspletosaurini. This group had longer, deeper snouts and more teeth in the upper jaws than tyrannosaurs found in the southern U.S., which had shorter, bulldog like faces, said Jared Voris, a Ph.D. student at the University of Calgary. This discovery is significant because it fills in a gap in our understanding of tyrannosaur evolution, Dr. Therrien said. Thanatotheristes degrootorum provides scientists with insights into the tyrannosaur family tree, and shows that tyrannosaurs from the Cretaceous of Alberta were more diverse than previously known. The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal Cretaceous Research.

Their once large populations went extinct in two waves, an end Pleistocene extinction of continental populations followed by the mid Holocene extinction of relict populations on St. Paul Island, a small island in the middle of the Bering Sea, 5,600 years ago, and on Wrangel Island, a remote Arctic refuge off the coast of Siberia, 4,000 years ago. To learn about the plight of these giant creatures and the forces that contributed to their extinction, a team of researchers has resurrected Wrangel Island mammoths mutated genes. The goal was to study whether the genes functioned normally. They did not. The key innovation of our paper is that we actually resurrect Wrangel Island mammoth genes to test whether their mutations actually were damaging most mutations dont actually do anything, said Dr. Vincent Lynch, an evolutionary biologist at the University at Buffalo. Beyond suggesting that the last mammoths were probably an unhealthy population, its a cautionary tale for living species threatened with extinction if their populations stay small, they too may accumulate deleterious mutations that can contribute to their extinction. To conduct the study, Dr. Lynch and his colleagues first compared DNA of a Wrangel Island mammoth to that of three Asian elephants and two more ancient mammoths that lived when mammoth populations were much larger. The scientists identified a number of genetic mutations unique to the Wrangel Island mammoth. Then, they synthesized the altered genes, inserted that DNA into cells in Petri dishes, and tested whether proteins expressed by the genes interacted normally with other genes or molecules. The researchers did this for genes that are thought or known to be involved in a range of important functions, including neurological development, male fertility, insulin signaling and sense of smell. In the case of detecting odors, for example, we know how the genes responsible for our ability to detect scents work, Dr. Lynch said. So we can resurrect the mammoth version, make cells in culture produce the mammoth gene, and then test whether the protein functions normally in cells. If it doesnt  and it didnt  we can infer that it probably means that Wrangel Island mammoths were unable to smell the flowers that they ate. This study builds on prior work by other scientists, such as a 2017 paper in which authors identified potentially detrimental genetic mutations in the Wrangel Island mammoth, estimated to be a part of a population containing only a few hundred members of the species. The results are very complementary, Dr. Lynch said. The 2017 study predicts that Wrangel Island mammoths were accumulating damaging mutations. We found something similar and tested those predictions by resurrecting mutated genes in the lab. The take home message is that the last mammoths may have been pretty sick and unable to smell flowers, so thats just sad. The results were published in the journal Genome Biology and Evolution.

Pterosaurs were Earths first flying vertebrates, with birds and bats making their appearances much later. They lived at the same time as dinosaurs, between 210 million years ago Triassic period and 65 million years ago Cretaceous period. Some pterosaurs, such as the giant azhdarchids, were the largest flying animals of all time, with wingspans exceeding 9 m 30 feet and standing heights comparable to modern giraffes. What pterosaurs ate depended on where they lived some species spent their lives around water, while others were more terrestrial. Terrestrial pterosaurs hunted small dinosaurs, lizards, eggs, insects and various other animals. Aquatic pterosaurs ate a variety of marine life, including fish, mollusks, and crabs. The long tailed pterosaur Rhamphorhynchus muensteri was mainly a fish eater. It lived in what is now Europe some 150 million years ago the Jurassic period and measured up to 1.3 m 4.3 feet long with a wingspan of 1.8 m 5.9 feet. Rhamphorhynchus muensteri apparently fed on aquatic animals by grabbing prey whilst flying directly above, or floating upon less likely, the water surface, said Ruhr Universit\u00e4t Bochum paleontologist Rene Hoffmann and his colleagues. The researchers came to this conclusion when they found a tooth of the aquatic pterosaur embedded in an exceptionally preserved soft tissue specimen of the cephalopod Plesioteuthis subovata. Examination under ultraviolet light reveals the pterosaur tooth is embedded in the now phosphatized cephalopod soft tissue, which makes a chance association highly improbable, they said. According to its morphology, the tooth likely originates from the anterior to middle region of the upper or lower jaw of a large, osteologically mature individual. The 150 million year old fossil of Plesioteuthis subovata was recovered from the Altm\u00fchltal Formation in the Solnhofen Archipelago, southeastern Germany. The specimen has a total body length of 28.5 cm 11.2 inches, 18.8 cm 7.4 inches of which comprises the mantle. The embedded pterosaur tooth is approximately 1.9\u2009cm 0.75 inches long  only the crown is preserved  and 3\u2009mm 0.12 inches wide at its base. The tooth is slender and gently recurved, especially close to the pointed tip. Much of the enamel near the tip of the tooth is covered by phosphatized mantle. However, the brown patches around the centre of the tooth may represent enamel. Dr. Hoffmann and co authors examined the specimen and concluded that the tooth of Rhamphorhynchus muensteri became associated with Plesioteuthis subovata through the pterosaur biting the squid. We present this association as the first direct evidence of a predator prey interaction between pterosaurs and cephalopods, they said. This interaction took place at or near the water surface. A scavenging feeding mode for Rhamphorhynchus muensteri is doubtful because the pterosaur is unlikely to have dived to the highly dangerous anoxic sediment floor to access carrion. It is also unlikely that tooth breakage would occur while consuming the soft decaying mantle of a cephalopod carcass. Most likely, the tooth broke off in the Plesioteuthis subovata mantle when the pterosaur attacked and the cephalopod tried to escape. High mechanical stress was exerted to the base of the teeth that were in direct contact with the cephalopod. This fractured at least one tooth, which remained stuck in the mantle. It is impossible to assess whether Plesioteuthis subovata died as a result of the pterosaur attack or survived with the broken tooth in its mantle. In addition to revealing cephalopods as a likely part of the Rhamphorhynchus muensteri diet, this fossil provides evidence that Plesioteuthis subovata commonly lived in the upper part of the water column where it was accessible to pterosaurs. The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Thalattosaurs meaning ocean lizards were among several reptile lineages that adapted to marine life in the Mesozoic era. They grew to lengths of up to 3 4 m 10 13 feet and lived in equatorial oceans worldwide until they died out near the end of the Triassic period. Thalattosaurs were among the first groups of land dwelling reptiles to readapt to life in the ocean, said Dr. Neil Kelley, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University. They thrived for tens of millions of years, but their fossils are relatively rare so the new specimen helps fill an important gap in the story of their evolution and eventual extinction. The newly identified species is a small bodied estimated total length 75 90\u2009cm, or 2.5 3 feet thalattosaur. Named Gunakadeit joseeae, it lived about 220 million years ago Norian division of the Triassic period. When you find a new species, one of the things you want to do is tell people where you think it fits in the family tree. We decided to start from scratch on the family tree, said Dr. Patrick Druckenmiller, director and earth sciences curator at the University of Alaska Museum of the North. We were surprised when we identified where Gunakadeit joseeae landed, he added. It was so specialized and weird, we thought it might be out at the furthest branches of the tree. Instead its a relatively primitive type of thalattosaur that survived late into the existence of the group. The fossilized remains of Gunakadeit joseeae  a nearly complete skeleton including the skull  were recovered from the Norian sediments of Keku Islands, Alaska. The specimen is the most complete thalattosaur ever found in North America. When we saw the fossils skull, we could tell right away that it was something new because of its extremely pointed snout, which was likely an adaptation for the shallow marine environment where it lived, the researchers said. It was probably poking its pointy schnoz into cracks and crevices in coral reefs and feeding on soft bodied critters, Dr. Druckenmiller said. Its specialization may have been what ultimately led to its extinction. We think these animals were highly specialized to feed in the shallow water environments, but when the sea levels dropped and food sources changed, they had nowhere to go.

The newly discovered dinosaur belongs to Allosauridae, a group of small to large bodied, two legged carnivorous dinosaurs that lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Dubbed Allosaurus jimmadseni, the species inhabited the flood plains of western North America during the Jurassic period. The ancient creature was 8 to 9 m 26 29 feet long and had a mass of around 1.8 metric tons. It had relatively long legs and tail, and long arms with three sharp claws. At 155 million years old, Allosaurus jimmadseni is the geologically oldest species of Allosaurus predating the more well known Allosaurus fragilis. The new species is distinguished by a number of unique features, including low crests running from above the eyes to the snout and a relatively narrow back of the skull with a flat surface to the bottom of the upper skull under the eyes. Its skull was weaker with less of an overlapping field of vision than the younger Allosaurus fragilis. Previously, paleontologists thought there was only one species of Allosaurus in Jurassic North America, but this study shows there were two species  the newly described Allosaurus jimmadseni evolved at least 5 million years earlier than its younger cousin, Allosaurus fragilis, said Dr. Mark Loewen, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum of Utah and the University of Utah. The skull of Allosaurus jimmadseni is more lightly built than its later relative Allosaurus fragilis, suggesting a different feeding behavior between the two. Dr. Loewen and his colleague, Dr. Daniel Chure, a retired paleontologist at Dinosaur National Monument, described the new species from two well preserved skeletons and skulls. The first specimen was found by Dr. George Engelmann from the University of Nebraska, Omaha, on July 15, 1990 during a contracted paleontological inventory of the Morrison Formation of Dinosaur National Monument in northeastern Utah. The second specimen was found by the commercial fossil collecting company Siber+Siber, Ltd. at the Howe Quarry, the Morrison Formation, Wyoming, in 1991. Recognizing a new species of dinosaur in rocks that have been intensely investigated for over 150 years is an outstanding experience of discovery, Dr. Chure said. Allosaurus jimmadseni is a great example of just how much more we have to learn about the world of dinosaurs. Many more exciting fossils await discovery in the Jurassic rocks of the American West.

These ancient rocks formed in a lagoon or coastal lake environment, said Professor Steeve Bonneville, a scientist at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. The presence of fungi in this transitional area between water and land leads us to believe that these microscopic mushrooms were important partners of the first plants that colonized the Earths surface around 500 million years ago. Using multiple molecular analysis techniques, such as synchrotron radiation spectroscopy, \u03bc Raman confocal microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, and electron microscopy, Professor Bonneville and colleagues demonstrated the presence of chitin  a very tough compound found in the cell walls of fungi  in the Neoproterozoic fungal microfossils. The researchers also demonstrated that the organisms were eukaryotes, i.e. their cells had a nucleus. We document dark, nontranslucide, cylindrical filaments typically between 3.5 and 11.5 \u03bcm in width, extending over several hundreds of micrometers in length, they said. These filaments sometimes evolve into dense interconnected networks of 500 \u03bcm in diameter. In these mycelium like structures, filaments have multiple order, high angle branching and, possibly, anastomosing filaments, common features of fungal networks yet rare for prokaryotes. The filaments for living and fossil fungi range from 2 to over 20 \u03bcm in width. The size of the Neoproterozoic fossil filaments observed by the team fits well with fungal dimensions. This is a major discovery, and one that prompts us to reconsider our timeline of the evolution of organisms on Earth, Professor Bonneville said. The next step will be to look further back in time, in even more ancient rocks, for evidence of those microorganisms that are truly at the origins of the animal kingdom. The findings were published in a paper in the journal Science Advances. "}, {"title": " New Research Tracks Evolution of Extinct Straight-Tusked Elephants", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jan 23, 2020", "doc": "Palaeoloxodon is an extinct genus of straight tusked elephants that lived throughout Europe and Asia during the Pleistocene and Holocene. It migrated out of Africa about 800,000 years ago and divided into many species, with distinct species in Japan, Central Asia and Europe, and even dwarf species on some Mediterranean islands. A new study, published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, enhances our understanding of all these Palaeoloxodon species. The most intriguing feature of the straight tusked elephant, apart from its absolutely enormous size, is the massive, headband like crest on the skull roof  the so called parieto occipital crest  which projects down the forehead. When the celebrated Victorian Scottish geologist Hugh Falconer studied the first fossil skull of Palaeoloxodon found in India, he remarked that the head seemed so grotesquely constructed that it looks the caricature of an elephants head in a periwig. For a long time, palaeontologists thought that Palaeoloxodon antiquus from Europe had a rather slenderly built skull roof crest whereas the Indian species Palaeoloxodon namadicus is characterised by an extremely robust skull crest that extends near to the base of the trunk from the top of the skull. But some Palaeoloxodon skulls, found in Italy and Germany, with almost the same exaggerated skull crest as the Indian form, led a few scientists into suspecting these might all be single species. Just like modern elephants, Palaeoloxodon went through six sets of teeth in their lifetimes. This means we can tell the age of any individual with confidence by looking at its fossilised teeth, said Dr. Hanwen Zhang, a paleontologist in the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol and the Department of Earth Sciences at UKs Natural History Museum. When we looked at a series of skulls from Italy, Germany and India, we found a consistent pattern the skull crest developed from being very small, not protruding beyond the forehead in juveniles to being larger and more protruding in young adults, eventually becoming very stout in aged adults. As I plotted various skull and limb bone measurements for these incredible prehistoric elephants, it became clear that the Indian Palaeoloxodon form a distinct group from the European ones even in European skulls with quite pronounced crests, the skull roof never becomes as thickened as in the Indian specimens, said Dr. Asier Larramendi, an independent researcher from Spain. This tells us we once had two separate species of these enormous elephants in Europe and India. Besides the funky skull roof crest, the head of the straight tusked elephant is also remarkable for being huge, the largest of any elephant ever  some 1.4 m 4.5 feet from the top of the skull roof to the base of the tusk sheaths. Therefore, the skull crest probably evolved to provide additional attachment areas for extra neck muscles, so the animal did not fall on its head. Having gotten to the bottom of the antiquusnamadicus problem, it then became apparent that other fossil skull materials found in Asia and East Africa represent distinct, possibly more evolutionarily conservative species of Palaeoloxodon, Dr. Zhang said. Even in fully mature adults with the last set of teeth in place, the skull roof crest remains comparatively unpronounced. This is the case with the earliest Palaeoloxodon from Africa, some Asian species retained this condition.

The newly discovered ancient scorpion lived around 437 million years ago during the early Silurian period. Dubbed Parioscorpio venator, the animal was about 2.5 cm one inch long  about the same size as many extant scorpions. The creature is the earliest scorpion yet reported, and it provides new information about how animals transitioned from living in the sea to living entirely on land. Its respiratory and circulatory systems are almost identical to those of extant scorpions and operate similarly to those of a horseshoe crab. Parioscorpio venator shows a crucial evolutionary link between the way ancient ancestors of scorpions respired under water, and the way modern day scorpions breathe on land, said Professor Loren Babcock, a paleontologist in the School of Earth Sciences at the Ohio State University. The inner workings of the respiratory circulatory system in this animal are, shape wise, identical to those of the arachnids and scorpions that breathe air exclusively, he explained. But it also is incredibly similar to what we recognize in marine arthropods like horseshoe crabs. So, it looks like this scorpion, this lineage, must have been pre adapted to life on land, meaning they had the morphologic capability to make that transition, even before they first stepped onto land. The fossilized remains of Parioscorpio venator were unearthed in 1985 from the Brandon Bridge Formation, a site in Wisconsin that was once a small pool at the base of an island cliff face. The specimens belong to the so called Waukesha Biota, and were recovered from layers older than those from Scotland yielding Dolichophonus loudonensis, which was previously accepted as the oldest known scorpion. Professor Babcock, Otterbein Universitys Dr. Andrew Wendruff and their colleagues examined the fossils under a microscope, and took detailed, high resolution photographs of the fossils from different angles. They were able to identify the appendages, a chamber where the animal would have stored its venom, and the remains of its respiratory and circulatory systems. Were looking at the oldest known scorpion  the oldest known member of the arachnid lineage, which has been one of the most successful land going creatures in all of Earth history, Professor Babcock said. And beyond that, what is of even greater significance is that weve identified a mechanism by which animals made that critical transition from a marine habitat to a terrestrial habitat. It provides a model for other kinds of animals that have made that transition including, potentially, vertebrate animals. Its a groundbreaking discovery. The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal Scientific Reports.

The newly discovered dinosaur lived during the Cretaceous period, approximately 120 million years ago. Named Wulong bohaiensis, the species was larger than a common crow but smaller than a raven. It had a narrow face filled with sharp teeth and a long, bony tail which would have doubled its length. Wulong bohaiensis was covered with feathers, including a wing like array on both its arms and legs and two long plumes at the end of its tail. The dinosaur is one of the earliest relatives of Velociraptor, the famous dromaeosaurid theropod that lived some 75 million years ago. The new dinosaur fits in with an incredible radiation of feathered, winged animals that are closely related to the origin of birds, said Dr. Ashley Poust, a postdoctoral researcher at the San Diego Natural History Museum. Studying specimens like this not only shows us the sometimes surprising paths that ancient life has taken, but also allows us to test ideas about how important bird characteristics, including flight, arose in the distant past. The skeleton of Wulong bohaiensis was recovered from the Jiufotang Formation in China more than a decade ago by a local farmer. The specimen has feathers on its limbs and tail that we associate with adult birds, but it had other features that made us think it was a juvenile, Dr. Poust said. Dr. Poust and colleagues analyzed the dinosaurs bones and found that this individual was a juvenile. This means that at least some dinosaurs were getting very mature looking feathers well before they were done growing, they said. Birds grow up very fast and often dont get their adult plumage until well after they are full sized. Showy feathers, especially those used for mating, are particularly delayed. And yet here was an immature dinosaur with two long feathers extending beyond the tip of the tail. A paper on the discovery of Wulong bohaiensis was published The Anatomical Record.

The worm like animals lived during the Ediacaran period, some 550 million years ago. Not only are these structures the oldest guts yet discovered, but they also help to resolve the long debated evolutionary positioning of this important fossil group, said Dr. Jim Schiffbauer, a researcher in the Department of Geological Sciences and the X ray Microanalysis Core at the University of Missouri. These fossils fit within a very recognizable group of organisms  the cloudinids  that scientists use to identify the last 10 to 15 million years of the Ediacaran period. We can now say that their anatomical structure appears much more worm like than coral like. The cloudinomorph fossils studied by Dr. Schiffbauer and colleagues were recovered from the Wood Canyon Formation, Nye County, Nevada, the United States. The scientists used micro CT imaging to produce digital 3D images of the specimens. With CT imaging, we can quickly assess key internal features and then analyze the entire fossil without potentially damaging it, said Dr. Tara Selly, also from the Department of Geological Sciences and the X ray Microanalysis Core at the University of Missouri. The team was able to identify the fossilized soft tissues within the external tubes of the cloudinomorphs. Although alternative interpretations are plausible, these internal cylindrical structures may be most appropriately interpreted as digestive tracts, which would be, to date, the earliest known occurrence of such features in the fossil record, the paleontologists said. If this interpretation is correct, their nature as one way through guts not only provides evidence for establishing these fossils as definitive bilaterians but also has implications for the long debated phylogenetic position of the broader cloudinomorphs. The results were published in the journal Nature Communications.

Myxomycetes or slime molds are a monophyletic lineage of eukaryotes that produce intriguing, morphologically complex fruiting bodies, said University of Helsinkis Professor Jouko Rikkinen and colleagues. They are phylogenetically an ancient lineage within the Amoebozoa, but like most amoeboid microorganisms, direct evidence of their evolutionary history is extremely scarce. The piece of amber containing the fossil myxomycete came from the outcrop near Tanai, a village in Kachin State, northern Myanmar. The specimen consists of a group of six stalked fruiting bodies sporocarps entrapped in resin while young, with almost entire spore mass. The fragile fruiting bodies were most likely torn from the tree bark by a lizard, which was also caught in the sticky tree resin, and finally embedded in it together with the reptile, Professor Rikkinen said. The lizard detached the fruiting bodies at a relatively early stage when the spores had not yet been released, which now reveals valuable information about the evolutionary history of these fascinating organisms. According to the team, the sporocarps of the ancient myxomycete are indistinguishable from Stemonitis, one of the two main lineages of the myxomycetes. The fossil provides unique insights into the longevity of the ecological adaptations of myxomycetes, said University of G\u00f6ttingens Professor Alexander Schmidt. We interpret this as evidence of strong environmental selection. It seems that slime molds that spread very small spores using the wind had an advantage, Professor Rikkinen added. The ability of slime molds to develop long lasting resting stages in their life cycle, which can last for years, probably contributes to the remarkable similarity of the fossil to its closest present day relatives.

Nicknamed Jane and Petey, the individuals would have been slightly taller than a draft horse and twice as long. Settling a debate about whether Jane and Petey represent a separate genus of pygmy tyrannosaurs Nanotyrannus or rather just juveniles of Tyrannosaurus rex, an analysis of sliced bones from the two specimens suggests the latter. Historically, many museums would collect the biggest, most impressive fossils of a dinosaur species for display and ignore the others, said Dr. Holly Woodward, a paleontologist in the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences. The problem is that those smaller fossils may be from younger animals. So, for a long while weve had large gaps in our understanding of how dinosaurs grew up, and T. rex is no exception. The smaller size of the Jane and Petey specimens is what make them so incredibly important. Not only can paleontologists study how the bones and proportions changed as T. rex matured, but they can also utilize paleohistology the study of fossil bone microstructure to learn about juvenile growth rates and ages. In the study, Dr. Woodward and colleagues removed thin slices from the leg bones of Jane and Petey and examined them at high magnification. The researchers compared the organization of bone fibers and other microstructures in the specimens, finding that they appeared to have been growing, as evidenced by growth rings in the bone in a spaced out pattern not typically seen in adults. The bones also lacked the closely spaced series of lines present in adults that signals growth is complete. The authors determined that small T. rex were growing as fast as modern day warm blooded animals. They also found that Jane and Petey were teenaged T. rex when they died 13 and 15 years old, respectively. The results also support that a skull specimen at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, which was classified as Nanotyrannus in 1988, is actually a young T. rex. Because it took T. rex up to twenty years to reach adult size, the tyrant king probably underwent drastic changes as it matured, Dr. Woodward said. Juveniles such as Jane and Petey were fast, fleet footed, and had knife like teeth for cutting, whereas adults were lumbering bone crushers. Not only that, but we discovered that growing T. rex could do a neat trick if its food source was scarce during a particular year, it just didnt grow as much. And if food was plentiful, it grew a lot. The findings appear in the January 1, 2020 issue of the journal Science Advances.

Its very surprising how similar these ancient polar forests were to some of our modern forests, said Dr. Christopher West, a paleobotanist in the Departnmet of Geological Sciences at the University of Saskatchewan and the corresponding author of the study. We identified fossil plants related to many modern temperate trees birch, alder, elms  even plants belonging to the grape family. Some of the fossils are related to trees now found only in East Asia. The presence of these forests gives us an idea about what could happen over long periods of time if our modern climate continues to warm, and also how forest ecosystems responded to greenhouse climates in the distant past. In the study, Dr. West and his colleagues, University of Saskatchewans Dr. Jim Basinger and Brandon Universitys Dr. David Greenwood, created a comprehensive catalogue of fossil plants from multiple localities on Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg islands. They identified and described 83 types of plants 62 dicot angiosperms, three monocotyledonous angiosperms, 13 gymnosperms, and five pteridophytes. While Earth was considerably warmer during the early Eocene, the continents were mostly situated where they are now, and northern latitudes would have had lengthy periods of darkness, the researchers said. Despite the nearly total lack of light, the forests persisted, likely because of just how warm it was. We wont see a return to a forested polar region in our lifetimes, but it is important to remember that we as humans have become agents of climate change, and that our warming climate will have potentially dramatic effects on our modern ecosystems, Dr. West said. If we are able to understand how ecosystems long ago responded to global warming, we may be able to better predict how our own modern ecosystems will respond to our own rapidly warming climate. This research will also help climate modelers as they use data from the past to better understand our own climate.

Our research, completed on dinosaur bearing rocks throughout Victoria, suggests that warming temperatures allowed the first flowering plants to migrate to the cooler regions at the Earths poles, said Smithsonian Institution researcher Vera Korasidis, who performed the study while she was a research assistant at the University of Melbourne. The true diversity of primitive flowers in southern near polar settings has only just been discovered because sieving practices resulted in pollen grains, produced by the earlier flowers, being rinsed down the sink for over 50 years. In the study, Dr. Korasidis and her colleague, University of Melbournes Dr. Barbara Wagstaff, analyzed the fossilized pollen and leaves of ancient angiosperms from numerous sites  such as the Otway and Gippsland basins  in Victoria, southeastern Australia. We reconstructed our earliest flower bearing forests, from 126 100 million years ago Cretaceous period, to conclude that climate change prevented or slowed the expansion of flowers into Australasia with the temperatures at the high southern latitudes too cold to support the earliest flowering plants, they explained. We also established that the first flowers related to 72 of todays living angiosperm species that first appeared in southern Australia about 108 million years ago  17 million years after the first flowers evolved in equatorial regions, they said. The worlds oldest flower, Montsechia, is 130 million years old and was discovered in Spain.

Parental care is a behavioral strategy where parents make an investment or divert resources from themselves to increase the health and chances of survival for their offspring, said paleontologist Professor Hillary Maddin and her colleagues from Carleton University and Fundy Treasures. While there are a variety of parental care strategies, prolonged postnatal care is amongst the most costly to a parent. This form of parental care is particularly common in mammals, as all mammalian offspring demand nourishment from their mothers. However, there is still little understanding of the evolutionary history of this behavior. Professor Maddins team found the fossilized remains of an adult creature and an associated juvenile inside a lithified tree stump on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. The specimen represents not only a new species but also belongs to an entirely new genus of varanopid synapsid. The researchers named the ancient animal Dendromaia unamakiensis. This is the earliest evidence of prolonged postnatal care in a vertebrate, Professor Maddin said. The adult animal appears to be concealing and protecting a juvenile in a den. This behavior is very common in mammals today. It is interesting to see this animal, which is on the evolutionary line leading to mammals, exhibiting this behavior so early.

The fossils provide the first evidence of perinatal dinosaurs from Australia and, more broadly, the first insights into the high latitude breeding preferences of non iguanodontian ornithopods in Gondwana. The newly studied fossils belong to a species of small bodied ornithopod dinosaur very similar to Weewarrasaurus pobeni. To estimate the individuals age, the researchers used growth rings in the dinosaur bones, similar to the rings in a tree trunk. Age is usually estimated by counting growth rings, but we couldnt do this with our two smallest specimens, which had lost their internal detail, said Justin Kitchener, a PhD student in the School of Environmental and Rural Science at the University of New England. To get around this, we compared the size of these bones with the size of growth rings from the Victorian dinosaurs. This comparison confidently places them at an early growth stage, probably prior to, or around the point of hatching. Approximately 100 million years ago, when these dinosaurs were being born, Australia was much closer to the South Pole. Southeastern Australia would have been between 60\u00b0S and 70\u00b0S, equivalent to modern day Greenland, the scientists explained. Although the climate at these latitudes was relatively warmer than they are today, like some Antarctic penguins, these dinosaurs would have endured long dark winters and possibly burrowed or hibernated to survive. Because they are so delicate, egg shell and tiny bones rarely survive to become fossils. We have examples of hatchling sized dinosaurs from close to the North Pole, but this is the first time weve seen this kind of thing anywhere in the Southern Hemisphere, said Dr. Phil Bell, a paleontologist in the School of Environmental and Rural Science at the University of New England.

Lungfish subclass Dipnoi are a group of lobe finned fish with their origins stretching back to the Early Devonian period, over 410 million years ago. They reached a peak of diversity and abundance throughout the Devonian with close to 100 species described from that time period. More than 25 species originated in the eastern Gondwanan Australia waters and others are known to have lived in temperate tropical and subtropical waters of China and Morocco. The newly discovered species represents the only record of Late Devonian lungfish remains from the western Gondwana South America and Africa. Named Isityumzi mlomomde, the ancient creature is also the only lungfish known from the Witpoort Formation of South Africa. Isityumzi mlomomde was found about 10,000 km from a previous species described in Morocco, and is of interest because it existed in a high latitude 70 degrees south or polar environment at the time, said Dr. Alice Clement, a paleontologist at Flinders University and corresponding author of a paper published in the journal PeerJ. Isityumzi mlomomdes tooth plates, scales and two parasphenoids a bone in the cranium of many vertebrates were found between 1999 and 2017 by Dr. Robert Gess, a paleontologist with Rhodes University, Albany Museum, and Wits University and co author of the paper. This lungfish material is significant for a number of reasons, Dr. Clement explained. Firstly, it represents the only Late Devonian lungfish known from the western Gondwana. During this period, about 372 359 million years ago, South Africa was situated next to the South Pole. Secondly, Isityumzi mlomomde seems to have lived in a thriving ecosystem, indicating this region was not as cold as the polar regions of today. The animal would still have been subject to long periods of winter darkness, very different to the freshwater habitats that lungfish live in today when there are only six known species of lungfish living only in Africa, South America and Australia.

The Cairo fossil forest covered an area of at least 3,000 m2, and is one or two million years older than the Devonian fossil forest at Gilboa, also in New York and around 40 km away from the Cairo site. The Devonian period represents a time in which the first forest appeared on Earth, said Binghamton Universitys Professor William Stein. The effects were of first order magnitude, in terms of changes in ecosystems, what happens on the Earths surface and oceans, carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere, and global climate. So many dramatic changes occurred at that time as a result of those original forests that basically, the world has never been the same since. Professor Stein and colleagues found that the Cairo forest was home to at least three unique root systems. First, they identified a rooting system that they believe belonged to a palm tree like plant called Eospermatopteris. This tree, which was first discovered in the Gilboa forest, had relatively rudimentary roots. Like a weed, it likely occupied many environments, explaining its presence at both sites. But its roots had relatively limited range and probably lived only a year or two before dying and being replaced by other roots that would occupy the same space. The paleontologists also found evidence of a tree species called Archaeopteris. Although this tree behaved more like a fern during reproduction, by releasing spores into the air instead of forming seeds, it had early hints at what would one day become seed plants. Archaeopteris are the first known plants to form leaves, and were large woody plants formed from secondary tissues. Archaeopteris seems to reveal the beginning of the future of what forests will ultimately become, Professor Stein said. Based on what we know from the body fossil evidence of Archaeopteris prior to this, and now from the rooting evidence that weve added at Cairo, these plants are very modern compared to other Devonian plants. The researchers found an extensive network of Archaeopteris roots which were more than 11 m in length in some places. They also found a third root system belonging to a tree thought to only exist during the Carboniferous period and later scale trees belonging to the class Lycopsida. The team believes that the Cairo forest was wiped out by a flood due to the presence of many fish fossils that were also visible on the surface of the quarry. It is surprising to see plants which were previously thought to have had mutually exclusive habitat preferences growing together on the ancient Catskill delta, said Dr. Chris Berry, a scientist in the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at Cardiff University. This would have looked like a fairly open forest with small to moderate sized coniferous looking trees with individual and clumped tree fern like plants of possibly smaller size growing between them.

Anthropocene era Earth. The fossil record of mammals will provide a clear signal of the Anthropocene, said University of Illinois at Chicagos Professor Roy Plotnick and Missouri Western State Universitys Dr. Karen Koy. The number of humans and their animals greatly exceeds that of wild animals, they added. As an example, in the state of Michigan alone, humans and their animals compose about 96 of the total mass of animals. There are as many chickens as people in the state, and the same should be true in many places in the United States and the world. The chance of a wild animal becoming part of the Anthropocene era fossil record has become very small, according to the scientists. Instead, the future mammal record will be mostly cows, pigs, sheep, goats, dogs, cats, etc., and people themselves. Hunting and butchering produce distinctive bone fragments and assemblages, they said. Use of large agricultural equipment and increased domestic animal density due to intensive animal farming likely increases the rate of and changes the kind of damage to bones. Fossil mammals occur in caves, ancient lakebeds and river channels, and are usually only teeth and isolated bones, Professor Plotnick added. Animals that die on farms or in mass deaths due to disease often end up as complete corpses in trenches or landfills, far from water. Consequently, the terrestrial mammalian fossil record of the modern era will be unique in the Earths history and unmistakable to paleontologists of the distant future.

Made about 340 million years ago, its the oldest known tetrapod trackway ever found in the United Kingdom. The Carboniferous trackway was first discovered in 1977 by S.J. Maude near the waterfall Hardraw Force in Wensleydale, the north Yorkshire Dales. Assigned to the ichnogenus Palaeosauropus, the prints were made by an edpoid temnospondyl, a primitive semiaquatic amphibian. Temnospondyls were highly successful animals, appearing during the Carboniferous period and evolving over the next 210 million years into a wide variety of forms, the paleontologists explained. While some were about the same size as modern day amphibians many grew to enormous sizes. Some of these things were large crocodile like animals at least two meters long with big heads, said Dr. Angela Milner, a researcher in the Department of Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museum, London. They have been nicknamed by some of my colleagues as croco manders, because they look like a crocodile but had the same lifestyle and walked the same way as salamanders. In order to better visualize the Hardraw trackway, Dr. Milner and colleagues 3D scanned the specimen. We used scanning and photography to make a 3D digital model, allowing us to better visualize and identify the footprints and invertebrate traces, explained Hannah Bird, a researcher with Dudley Museum and assistant curator of Carboniferous specimens at the Virtual Natural History Museum. Determining whether individual prints were made by hands or feet, as well as the direction of movement, certainly proved troublesome at times but we were finally able to reconstruct how this amphibian might have moved in life. It was revealed that the edpoid walked across the sandy bed of river delta along with contemporary invertebrate animals including arthropods, worms and mollusks.

Named Mesophthirus engeli, the prehistoric parasitic insect was notably small  up to 0.5 mm for adults and 0.2 mm in the nymph stage. It had wingless body, robust and short antennae, strong chewing mouthparts, and claws on its legs. Mesophthirus engeli shares many features of ectoparasitic function, i.e., wingless and dorsoventrally compressed body, reduced eyes, short antennae, robust and short legs unsuitable for quick movement or jump, pretarsus very small with one single claw, etc., which suggest that the insect had an ectoparasitic lifestyle, said Capital Normal University paleontologists Taiping Gao and Dong Ren and their colleagues from China, the United States and the United Kingdom. Most significantly, these insects are preserved with partially damaged dinosaur feathers, the damage of which was probably made by these insects integument feeding behaviors. The researchers found ten individuals of Mesophthirus engeli in two pieces of 99 million year old amber from the Hukawng Valley of Kachin State, in northern Myanmar, a village named Noije Bum about 18\u2009km\u00a011.2 miles southwest of the town of Tanai. One of the pieces contained nine specimens and the other had only one specimen. All these ten nymphs look very similar in morphology but have minor distinctions, and they may be easily divided to two different groups, the scientists explained. The members of the first group have relatively smaller body size under 145\u2009\u03bcm, much wider abdomens than their thoraxes, horizontal terminals of abdomens and apex of heads and compressed 5th antennomere. In contrast, the specimens within the second group possess bodies over 157\u2009\u03bcm in length, heads with arched top and clavate and smooth 5th antennomere. We identify these two groups as two different but adjoining developmental stages of Mesophthirus engeli, and their abdomens and antennae might grow to extend with age, same as the body size. The new findings provide the earliest known evidence about the origin of ectoparasitic insects feeding on feathers, which strongly support that the integument feeding behaviors of insects appeared during or before the mid Cretaceous along with the radiations of feathered dinosaurs including birds, the paleontologists concluded. A paper on the findings was published December 10, 2019 in the journal Nature Communications.

Named Aegicetus gehennae, the ancient animal represents an important step in the evolution of whale locomotion. Protocetidae protocetids are a group of semi aquatic whales known from the middle Eocene epoch of Africa, Asia, North America, and South America. While living whales use their tails to propel themselves through the water, most protocetids were foot powered swimmers. The newly discovered protocetid, Aegicetus gehennae, was more fully aquatic and less specialized as a foot powered swimmer than earlier protocetids. It represents a transitional stage between the foot powered swimming of early whales and the tail powered swimming of living whales. It is the youngest known protocetid, dating to around 35 million years ago, and is known from one exceptionally complete skeleton and a partial second specimen, making it among the best preserved ancient whales, explained University of Michigans Professor Philip Gingerich and colleagues. Aegicetus gehennae had an estimated body mass of about 900 kg, according to the team. Compared with earlier whales, it has a more elongated body and tail, smaller back legs, and lacks a firm connection between the hind legs and the spinal column, the researchers said. These adaptations indicate an animal that was more fully aquatic and less of a foot powered swimmer than its ancestors. The fossilized bones of two Aegicetus gehennae individuals were collected in 2007 from the Gehannam Formation of Wadi Al Hitan Valley of Whales, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Western Desert of Egypt. The body shape of Aegicetus gehennae is similar to that of other ancient whales of its time, such as the famous Basilosaurus, Professor Gingerich and co authors said. These animals appear to be well adapted for swimming through undulation of the mid body and the tail, somewhat as crocodiles swim today. They published a paper describing Aegicetus gehennae this week in the journal PLoS ONE.

Dubbed Kupoupou stilwelli, the ancient bird is the oldest penguin known with proportions close to its modern relatives. Kupoupou stilwelli lived during the Paleocene epoch at a time when there was no ice cap at the South Pole and the seas around New Zealand were tropical or subtropical. Numerous skeletal remains of the prehistoric penguin were recovered from the Takatika Grit of Chatham Island, part of the Chatham Islands located about 535 miles 860 km off the east coast of New Zealands mainland. The fossils were analyzed by Flinders University paleontologist Jacob Blokland and his colleagues. Next to its colossal human sized cousins, including the recently described monster penguin Crossvallia waiparensis, Kupoupou stilwelli was comparatively small  no bigger than the modern king penguin Aptenodytes patagonicus which stands just under 3.6 feet 1.1 m tall, Blokland said. It also had proportionally shorter legs than some other early fossil penguins. In this respect, it was more like the penguins of today, meaning it would have waddled on land. This penguin is the first that has modern proportions both in terms of its size and in its hind limb and foot bones the tarsometatarsus or foot shape. The discovery of Kupoupou stilwelli may link the origins of penguins themselves to the eastern region of New Zealand  from the Chatham Island archipelago to the eastern coast of the South Island, where other most ancient penguin fossils have been found. The study provides further support for the theory that penguins rapidly evolved shortly after the period when dinosaurs still walked the land and giant marine reptiles swam in the sea, said Dr. Paul Scofield, from the University of Canterbury and the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch. We think its likely that the ancestors of penguins diverged from the lineage leading to their closest living relatives  such as albatross and petrels  during the Late Cretaceous period, and then many different species sprang up after the dinosaurs were wiped out. Its not impossible that penguins lost the ability to fly and gained the ability to swim after the extinction event of 66 million years ago, implying the birds underwent huge changes in a very short time. If we ever find a penguin fossil from the Cretaceous period, well know for sure. The teams paper was published in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica. "}, {"title": " New Cretaceous-Period Mammal Unveiled", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Dec 6, 2019", "doc": "Paleontologists have discovered the remains of a previously unknown symmetrodont mammal that lived alongside dinosaurs in what is now China. The fossils provide a record of the final steps in the evolution of mammals multi boned middle ears. While modern mammals owe their keen sense of hearing to the three tiny bones that form the complex architecture of the middle ear, these tiny ossicles were once instead part of the jaw, which served a dual function for both chewing and hearing in our earliest ancestors, said Dr. Fangyuan Mao, a researcher in the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, the CAS Center for Excellence in Life and Paleoenvironment, and the American Museum of Natural History, and her colleagues. The evolutionary event in which jaw bones were co opted to form the tri ossicular hearing apparatus of mammals is widely recognized. However, fossilized examples demonstrating the intermittent steps are elusive. The detached auditory bones of the newly discovered Cretaceous mammal represent an important final step in the evolution of the definitive mammalian middle ear. The ancient mammal belongs to Symmetrodonta, a group of Mesozoic mammals and mammal like synapsids. Named Origolestes lii, the creature was part of the famous Jehol Biota, an early Cretaceous terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem preserved in a multi layered rock formation cropping out in the Chinese provinces of Liaoning, Hebei and Inner Mongolia. Using high resolution CT scanning and other imaging efforts, Dr. Mao and co authors were able to study structures of the creatures auditory bones and cartilage, which lacked the bone on bone contact of earlier species. The multidirectional movements of the mandibular during chewing are likely to be one of the selection pressures that caused the detachment of the auditory ossicles from the dental bone and the Meckes cartilage, Dr. Mao said. This decoupled feature in Origolestes lii bridges the morphological gap between the transitional and the definitive mammalian middle ear and represents a more advanced stage in the evolution of the mammalian middle ear, the study authors explained. From the perspective of morphology and function, the decoupled hearing and chewing modules eliminated physical constraints that interfered with each other and possibly increased the capacity of the two modules to evolve. Therefore, the hearing module may have had greater potential to develop sensitive hearing of high frequency sounds, and the chewing module may have been able to evolve diverse tooth morphologies and occlusal patterns that facilitated consuming different foods. The study was published in the journal Science.

Named Eobodotria muisca, the ancient crustacean bridges an approximately 165 million year gap in the fossil record of comma shrimps order Cumacea. Comma shrimps, also known as hooded shrimps, are tiny marine arthropods with unusual comma shaped bodies. Even though they are an abundant group, with nearly 2,000 species distributed throughout the globe, they have one of the poorest fossil records among crustaceans. Comma shrimp are small, delicate crustaceans with one of the poorest fossil records among marine arthropods, said Dr. Javier Luque, a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University. There are eight families, over 165 genera and close to 2,000 species of living comma shrimp, and despite living in soft sediments with high potential for fossilization worldwide, none of them have known fossils, he added. This means that we had no idea about when modern comma shrimp evolved, until now. Our new fossil discovery is one of a kind and represents the oldest modern comma shrimp known, and a first for the Neotropics. Dr. Luque and colleagues found over 500 individuals of Eobodotria muisca at the site of Boyac\u00e1 in Colombia. The 6 8 mm long specimens were preserved in such detail that even their eyes, antennae, mouthparts, legs, guts and hairs were easy to distinguish. These fossils are of hundreds of adult males, which likely died suddenly in the water column while swarming during mating, falling slowly through the water with little or no damage. This left them in truly stunning condition, said Professor Sarah Gerken, from the University of Alaska Anchorage.  The excellent condition of the fossils allowed the team to create a 3D reconstruction of what they might have looked like while alive. The key morphological features that define cumaceans are simply missing from the other fossils. The 160 million year old Jurassic species from France is a true cumacean, but the few specimens known are not preserved in detail to elucidate any family relationship or even determine their sex, Professor Gerken said. Our new fossil from Colombia, represented by hundreds of individuals, is the first confirmed fossil that belongs to a living family of comma shrimp, the Bodotriidae, and dramatically extends the fossil record of the family for nearly a hundred million years, Dr. Luque said.

Pterosaurs were highly successful flying reptiles  not dinosaurs, as theyre commonly mislabeled  that lived at the same time as nonavian dinosaurs, between 210 million and 65 million years ago. Some pterosaurs were the largest flying animals of all time, with wingspans exceeding 30 feet 9 m and standing heights comparable to modern giraffes. The newly discovered species was a comparatively small pterosaur, with long wings and a wingspan of approximately 4.3 feet 1.32 m. Named Mimodactylus libanensis, it lived 95 million years ago Cretaceous period in the middle of what is now called the Tethys Seaway, a vast expanse of shallow marine waters filled with reefs and lagoons, separating Europe from Africa and stretching all the way to Southeast Asia. The diversity of pterosaurs was much greater than we could ever have guessed at, and is likely orders of magnitude more diverse than we will ever be able to discover from the fossil record, said Professor Michael Caldwell, a paleontologist at the University of Alberta. The almost complete skeleton of Mimodactylus libanensis  including the skull and lower jaw  was recovered from the Hjo\u00fbla Lagerst\u00e4tte of the Sannine Limestone near the town of Hjo\u00fbla, Lebanon. The ancient reptile likely fed on crustaceans, catching its prey at the surface as do modern seabirds such as the albatross and frigatebird. It differs from the other Afro Arabian pterosaur species named to date and is closely related to the Chinese species Haopterus gracilis, forming a new group of toothed pterosaurs. This means that this Lebanese pterodactyloid was part of a radiation of flying reptiles living in and around and across the ancient Tethys Seaway, from China to a great reef system in what is today Lebanon, Professor Caldwell said. A paper on the discovery of Mimodactylus libanensis was published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Dr. Bruce Archibald, a paleontologist at Simon Fraser University, and Royal BC Museum dragonfly expert Robert Cannings examined nine rare dragonfly fossils from the site of McAbee in British Columbia and from the town of Republic in northern Washington. They found the fossils represent eight previously unknown species, six of which were well enough preserved to be given scientific names Antiquiala snyderae, Idemlinea versatilis, Ypshna brownleei, Ypshna latipennata, Eoshna thompsonensis, and Auroradraco eos. While some of the fossil insect groups from these beds lived alongside the dinosaurs before eventually becoming extinct, and would be strange to see today, these dragonflies belong to modern families, mostly to a diverse group called the darners, the researchers explained. They would not look out of place today flying beside a modern pond. Other dragonfly groups that are familiar today appear to have begun their diversification to modern dominance shortly after, Dr. Archibald said. This is rather intriguing as many of the closely related damselflies that were looking at in our next project dont appear so modern at all. Why these two groups had such different evolutionary trajectories, we dont know. The new Ypshna species appear closely related to Parabaissaeshna ejerslevense, a fossil species of the same age from Denmark. This is not surprising, because North America and Europe were then connected by continual land across Greenland, when mild climates predominated right to the Arctic Ocean, Dr. Archibald said. You could probably have walked from Kamloops to Copenhagen without getting your feet wet, through forest all the way. It was wonderful to see a dragonfly from the club tail family show up in these fossils, Dr. Cannings said. They were pretty common in the Early Cretaceous epoch, but werent seen again until tens of millions of years after the time of our new fossil species. This begins to fill in about a 66 million year gap in their evolutionary history. A paper describing the findings was published in The Canadian Entomologist.

New research challenges the notion built from previous studies that our species was the principal driver of extinctions in Australia, and that climate change was at best a secondary contributor instead, it reveals a more complex scenario where climate change could have limited the amount of available resources for giant animals, but that human appearance was likely another important and necessary contributor to explain the megafaunas disappearance in many parts of the continent. There has been much debate among scientists about what conditions led to this extinction event, said Dr. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rik Saltr\u00e9, a researcher at Flinders University. Resolving this question is important because it is one of the oldest such extinction events anywhere after modern human beings evolved and left Africa. In the study, Dr. Saltr\u00e9 and colleagues analyzed fossil data, climate reconstructions, and archaeological information describing patterns in human migration across south eastern Australia. They developed and applied sophisticated mathematical models to test scenarios to explain regional variation in the periods during which people and megafauna coexisted. They found that the extinction pattern could only be explained by the combination of people sharing the environment and the reduced of availability of freshwater due to climate change. The regional patterns in extinction are best explained by the hypothesis that people migrated across Australia, exploiting lakes and other sources of drinking water connecting the drier regions in between, said Flinders Universitys Professor Corey Bradshaw. It is plausible that megafauna species were attracted to the same freshwater sources as humans, thus increasing the chance of interactions. The new insight that human pressure and climate change work together to trigger species extinction is a stark warning for the immediate future of the planets biodiversity facing even stronger climate and habitat disruption, Dr. Saltr\u00e9 said. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.

The ancient creature is a multituberculate mammal order Multituberculata, a distant relative of todays rodents. Named Jeholbaatar kielanae, the animal lived approximately 120 million years ago Early Cretaceous epoch in what is now China. It had a body mass of about 50 grams and a middle ear very distinct from those of its relatives. Jeholbaatar kielanae displays the first well preserved middle ear bones in multituberculates, providing solid evidence of the morphology and articulation of these bony elements, which are fully detached from the dentary, said team leader Professor Yuanqing Wang, a researcher in the Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins, the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It reveals a unique configuration with more complete components than those previously reported in multituberculates. The well preserved skeleton of Jeholbaatar kielanae was discovered in the Jiufotang Formation Jehol Biota near Changzigou, Lingyuan City, Chinas Liaoning Province. According to the team, it represents a transitional stage in the evolution of the surangular  a reptilian jawbone. Fossil evidence shows that postdentary bones were either embedded in the postdentary trough on the medial side of the dentary or connected to the dentary via an ossified Meckels cartilage in early mammals, prior to their migration into the cranium as seen in extant mammals, the scientists said. Detachment of the mammalian middle ear bones from the dentary occurred independently at least three times. But how and why this process took place in different clades of mammals remains unclear. Our findings suggest that the co evolution of the primary and secondary jaw joints in allotherians extinct branch of mammals, which includes Multituberculata was an evolutionary adaptation allowing feeding with unique palinal longitudinal and backwards chewing, they added. Thus, the evolution of the allotherian auditory apparatus was probably triggered by the functional requirements of the feeding apparatus. The teams paper was published in the journal Nature.

Im hoping this project spurs more people to study other species. I bet that will reveal further surprises, said lead author Dr. Michael DEmic, a researcher at Adelphi University and Stony Brook University. And hopefully that will lead to a better understanding of how dinosaurs evolved to be successful for so long. In the study, Dr. DEmic and colleagues estimated tooth formation and replacement rates in three carnivorous dinosaurs Majungasaurus, Allosaurus, and Ceratosaurus. The researchers used a collection of isolated fossil teeth to examine microscopic growth lines in the teeth. These growth lines are similar to tree rings, but instead of being deposited once a year, they are deposited daily. At the same, they used computerized tomography CT on intact jaws to visualize unerupted teeth growing deep inside the bones. They found high tooth replacement rates in all three dinosaurs, with Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus rates of around 100 days and 56 days for Majungasaurus. Majungasaurus would form a new tooth in each socket approximately every two months, Dr. DEmic said. This meant they were wearing down on their teeth quickly, possibly because they were gnawing on bones. There is independent evidence for this in the form of scratches and gouges that match the spacing and size of their teeth on a variety of bones  bones from animals that would have been their prey. Some animals today, too, will gnaw on bones, including rodents. Its a way for them to ingest certain nutrients, Dr. DEmic noted. It also requires exceptionally strong teeth  but Majungasaurus did not have those. Thats our working hypothesis for why they had such elevated rates of replacement, he added. The rapid fire tooth growth puts Majungasaurus in same league with sharks and big, herbivorous dinosaurs. The study is published in the journal PLoS ONE.

When and how this major evolutionary transition occurred is the focus of intense debate. Now, an international team of researchers from the United Kingdom, China and Switzerland has found evidence that a key step in this transition occurred long before complex animals appear in the fossil record, in the fossilized embryos that resemble multicellular stages in the life cycle of single celled relatives of animals. University of Bristols Professor Philip Donoghue, Dr. Zongjun Yin from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology and colleagues focused on the fossils of Caveasphaera, a multicellular organism that lived 609 million years ago Ediacaran period in what is now China. Individual Caveasphaera fossils are only about half a millimeter in diameter, but X ray microscopy revealed that they were preserved all the way down to their component cells. This study shows the amazing detail that can be preserved in the fossil record but also the power of X ray microscopes in uncovering secrets preserved in stone without destroying the fossils, said Dr. Federica Marone, a scientist with the Paul Scherrer Institute. We were able to sort the fossils into growth stages, reconstructing the embryology of Caveasphaera, added Dr. Kelly Vargas, a researcher at the University of Bristol. Our results show that Caveasphaera sorted its cells during embryo development, in just the same way as living animals, including humans, but we have no evidence that these embryos developed into more complex organisms, Dr. Yin said. Caveasphaera had a life cycle like the close living relatives of animals, which alternate between single celled and multicellular stages. However, Caveasphaera goes one step further, reorganizing those cells during embryology, said Dr. John Cunningham, also from the University of Bristol. Caveasphaera is the earliest evidence of this most important step in the evolution of animals, which allowed them to develop distinct tissue layers and organs, added Dr. Stefan Bengtson, from the Swedish Museum of Natural History. Im not totally convinced that Caveasphaera is an animal. It looks a lot like the embryos of some starfish and corals  we dont find the adult stages simply because they are harder to fossilize, said Dr. Maoyan Zhu, from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology. Caveasphaera shows features that look both like microbial relatives of animals and early embryo stages of primitive animals. Were still searching for more fossils that may help us to decide, Professor Donoghue said. Either way, fossils of Caveasphaera tell us that animal like embryonic development evolved long before the oldest definitive animals appear in the fossil record.

This discovery highlights the existence of a new type of hitchhiking behavior among wingless terrestrial arthropods, and could be key to explaining how symphypleonan springtails successfully achieved dispersal worldwide. The existence of this hitchhiking behavior is especially exciting given the fact that modern springtails are rarely described as having any interspecfic association with surrounding animals, said Dr. Ninon Robin, a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biological Sciences at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. This finding underscores how important fossils are for telling us about unsuspected ancient ecologies as well as still ongoing behaviors that were so far simply overlooked. Today, springtails subclass Collembola are among the most common arthropods found in moist habitats around the world. Most possess a specialized appendage under their abdomen they use to spring away in flee like fashion to avoid predation. However, this organ is not sufficient for traversing long distances, especially since most springtails are unable to survive long in dry areas. The ancient hitchhikers Dr. Robin and colleagues found in the Dominican amber, dubbed Electrosminthuridia helibionta, belong to a lineage of springtails found today on every continent, known as Symphypleona, which may have been pre adapted to grasping on to other arthropods through prehensile antennae. Because springtails would have encountered such winged termites and ants frequently due to their high abundance during the time of the preservation, these social insects may have been their preferred hosts for transportation. Symphypleonan springtails are unusual compared to other Collembola in that they have specialized antennae that are used in mating courtship, said Dr. Phillip Barden, from the Department of Biological Sciences at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and the Division of Invertebrate Zoology at the American Museum of Natural History. This antennal anatomy may have provided an evolutionary pathway for grasping onto other arthropods. In this particular fossil, we see these specialized antennae wrapping around the wings and legs of both an ant and termite. Some winged ants and termites are known to travel significant distances, which would greatly aid in dispersal. The study was published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.

The evolution of the snake body has captivated researchers for a long time, representing one of the most dramatic examples of the vertebrate bodys ability to adapt. But a limited fossil record has obscured our understanding of their early evolution until now. Snakes are famously legless, but then so are many lizards, said Dr. Alessandro Palci, a researcher at Flinders University. What truly sets snakes apart is their highly mobile skull, which allows them to swallow large prey items. For a long time we have been lacking detailed information about the transition from the relatively rigid skull of a lizard to the super flexible skull of snakes. Our findings support the idea that the ancestors of modern snakes were big bodied and big mouthed  instead of small burrowing forms as previously thought, added Dr. Fernando Garberoglio, a scientist in the Fundaci\u00f3n Azara at the Universidad Maim\u00f3nides. Dr. Palci, Dr. Garberoglio and their colleagues performed high resolution CT scanning and light microscopy of Najash rionegrina skulls from northern Patagonia, Argentina, to reveal substantial new anatomical data on the early evolution of snakes. Najash has the most complete, three dimensionally preserved skull of any ancient snake, and this is providing an amazing amount of new information on how the head of snakes evolved, Dr. Palci said. It has some, but not all of the flexible joints found in the skull of modern snakes. Its middle ear is intermediate between that of lizards and living snakes, and unlike all living snakes it retains a well developed cheekbone, which again is reminiscent of that of lizards. Najash shows how snakes evolved from lizards in incremental evolutionary steps, just like Darwin predicted, added Professor Mike Lee, from Flinders University and South Australian Museum. This research revolutionizes our understanding of the jugal bone in snake and non snake lizards, said Professor Michael Caldwell, from the University of Alberta. After 160 years of getting it wrong, this paper corrects this very important feature based not on guesswork, but on empirical evidence. The new snake family tree created by the team also reveals that snakes possessed small but perfectly formed hind legs for the first 70 million years of their evolution. The study reveals that early snakes retained their hindlimbs for an extended period of time before the origin of modern snakes which are for the most part, completely limbless, Dr. Garberoglio said. These primitive snakes with little legs werent just a transient evolutionary stage on the way to something better, Professor Lee said. Rather, they had a highly successful body plan that persisted across many millions of years, and diversified into a range of terrestrial, burrowing and aquatic niches.

The countrys fossil record includes many genera and species of giant penguins i.e., larger than living penguins, such as Kairuku, Pachydyptes, Palaeeudyptes and Kumimanu. The ancient giants differed from their living descendants in the length of their front limbs and elongated beaks, perhaps suggesting differences in ecological roles when compared with living species. The new fossil, which belongs to the genus Kairuku, was found in an Oligocene silty mudstone in Kawhia Harbour, New Zealands North Island. The Kawhia giant penguin is mostly complete and largely articulated in life position, which helps a great deal with reconstructing the relatively long and slender body, said Simone Giovanardi, a Ph.D. student at Massey University Albany. The forelimbs of the new penguin are almost identical in size when compared with Kairuku grebneffi, a similarly aged giant penguin from the South Island of New Zealand. However, its hindlimbs are significantly longer, exceeding in length all previously described specimens of the Kairuku genus. Moreover, the specimen presents a mixture of characters that show a transitional state between the ancestral body plan found in other Eocene Oligocene giant penguins and the body plan found in Kairuku, providing insight into the diversification of giant penguins, Giovanardi and colleagues said. The scientists reported the discovery October 9, 2019 at the 79th Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Brisbane, Australia. Simone Giovanardi et al.

The ancient bird lived approximately 120 million years ago during the Aptian age of the Early Cretaceous epoch. Dubbed Fukuipteryx prima, it was the size of a pigeon and is one of the most primitive birds ever discovered. Fukuipteryx prima is a non ornithothoracine bird and is the first such record to our knowledge outside north eastern China, said Dr. Takuya Imai, a researcher in the Institute of Dinosaur Research at the Fukui Prefectural University and the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum, and his colleagues from Japan and China. Except for Archaeopteryx, non ornithothoracine birds had previously been known only from the Jehol Biota and contemporary deposits in northern Korean Peninsula. The partial skeleton of Fukuipteryx prima was found in the Kitadani Dinosaur Quarry in the city of Katsuyama in Japans Fukui province in 2013. Unlike most other Early Cretaceous birds, the specimen is 3D preserved, and exhibits several autapomorphies, leading to erect a new taxon, Fukuipteryx prima, the paleontologists said. A bone analysis suggests that this individual was likely a subadult less than one year old nearly reaching its skeletal maturity. The bird had a set of features comparable to that of other earliest birds including Archaeopteryx. However, it was much more advanced than Archaeopteryx and had a long, robust, and rod shaped pygostyle  a fused cluster of tail vertebrae to which to which tail feathers are attached. Dr. Imai and co authors believe that Fukuipteryx prima was capable of limited flight. The discovery of Fukuipteryx prima further increases the geological distribution of non ornithothoracine birds, they said. It appears that they are not restricted to a relatively cold, highland lacustrine environment in the Early Cretaceous of north eastern China, but inhabited more temperate, lowland regions such as the one represented by the Kitadani Formation, most likely with other ornithothoracines widespread around the globe. The findings were published in the journal Communications Biology.

Gigantopithecus blacki is an extinct, giant hominid that once inhabited dense forests of Southeast Asia. As the name suggests, the giant primate was larger than gorillas, standing up to 10 feet 3 m and weighing up to 540 kg 1,200 lb. It was first discovered by the German paleontologist Gustav von Koenigswald in 1935, when he described an isolated tooth that he found in a Hong Kong drugstore. The entire fossil record of Gigantopithecus blacki  dated between the Early Pleistocene about two million years ago and the Middle Pleistocene about 300,000 years ago  includes thousands of teeth and four partial jaws from subtropical Southeast Asia. All the locations at which the primates remains have been found are in or near southern China, stretching from Longgupo Cave, just south of the Yangtze River, to the Xinchong Cave on Hainan Island and, possibly, into northern Vietnam and Thailand. Previous attempts to understand which could be the living organism most similar to Gigantopithecus could only be based on the comparison of the shape of the fossils with skeletal reference material from living great apes, said co lead author Dr. Enrico Cappellini, a researcher at the Globe Institute at the University of Copenhagen. Ancient DNA analysis was not an option, because Gigantopithecus went extinct approximately 300,000 years ago, and in the geographic area Gigantopithecus occupied no DNA older than approximately 10,000 years has been retrieved so far. Accordingly, we decided to sequence dental enamel proteins to reconstruct its evolutionary relation with living great apes, and we found that orangutan is Gigantopithecus closest living relative. To address the evolutionary relationships between Gigantopithecus blacki and living apes, Dr. Cappellini and colleagues retrieved dental enamel proteome sequences from a 1.9 million year old molar of the ancient primate found in Chuifeng Cave, China. By sequencing proteins retrieved from dental enamel about two million years old, we showed it is possible to confidently reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of animal species that went extinct too far away in time for their DNA to survive till now, Dr. Cappellini said. We can even conclude that the lineages of orangutan and Gigantopithecus split up about 12 million years ago. The analysis revealed that Gigantopithecus blacki belongs to the same clade as the orangutan, its closest living relative, although its separation with the current orangutans is very distant, which explains the previous confusion in the field, said co lead author Dr. Tomas Marques Bonet, a scientist at the University Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. Both soon diverged in the Miocene  more than 10 million years ago  but they certainly shared a common ancestor. Primates are relatively close to humans, evolutionary speaking, said first author Dr. Frido Welker, a postdoctoral researcher at the Globe Institute at the University of Copenhagen. With this study, we show that we can use protein sequencing to retrieve ancient genetic information from primates living in subtropical areas even when the fossil is two million years old. Until now, it has only been possible to retrieve genetic information from up to 10,000 year old fossils in warm, humid areas.

The newly discovered dinosaur lived approximately 67 million years ago Cretaceous period. Named Ferrisaurus sustutensis, the prehistoric creature was about 5.7 feet 1.75 m long. It probably weighed about 150 kg 330 lbs, similar in size to a bighorn sheep. A partial skeleton of Ferrisaurus sustutensis was collected from the Sustut Group of the southern Sustut Basin, a large but relatively unexplored terrestrial Cretaceous basin in northern British Columbia, Canada, said Dr. Victoria Arbour of the Royal BC Museum and Dr. David Evans of the Royal Ontario Museum and the University of Toronto. Ferrisaurus sustutensis belongs to Leptoceratopsidae, a family of hornless, parrot beaked plant eating dinosaurs closely related to the Triceratops. The skeleton of Ferrisaurus sustutensis includes parts of the pectoral girdles, left forelimb, left hindlimb, and right pes, the paleontologists said. It can be distinguished from other named leptoceratopsids based on the proportions of the ulna and pedal phalanges. According to the team, Ferrisaurus sustutensis is the first unique dinosaur species reported from British Columbia. By studying its bones and other fossils from the same region, were learning what British Columbia was like during the age of dinosaurs, 67 million years ago, the scientists said. Because so much of this province is mountainous and forested, evidence of BCs dinosaurs is challenging to find. The skeleton of Ferrisaurus sustutensis is now in the Royal BC Museums paleontological collections. The recognition of Ferrisaurus sustutensis as a distinct species of a generally rare group of small bodied dinosaurs highlights the potential for future discoveries of unique dinosaur biodiversity within the intermontane basins of the western side of the North American Cordillera, the researchers said. A paper describing the findings was published in the journal PeerJ.

Exceptionally preserved feathered dinosaur fossils including birds from the Mesozoic era are famous, but recognized from only very few localities worldwide, and are especially rare in the Southern Hemisphere. Dr. Benjamin Kear of Uppsala University and colleagues found and analyzed a collection of 10 Mesozoic fossil feathers in Australia. The fossils reveal an unexpected diversity of tufted hair like proto feathers from meat eating dinosaurs, together with downy body feathers, and wing feathers from primitive birds that would have been used for flight. The finds were all entombed in fine muddy sediments that accumulated at the bottom of a shallow lake close to the South Pole during the Age of Dinosaurs. Dinosaur skeletons and even the fragile bones of early birds have been found at ancient high latitudes before, Dr. Kear said. Yet, to date, no directly attributable integumentary remains have been discovered to show that dinosaurs used feathers to survive in extreme polar habitats. These Australian fossil feathers are therefore highly significant because they came from dinosaurs and small birds that were living in a seasonally very cold environment with months of polar darkness every year. The fossil feathers were discovered in the Koonwarra Fish Beds Geological Reserve, which is a heritage listed site 145 km southeast of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. Fossil feathers have been known from Koonwarra since the early 1960s, and were recognized as evidence of ancient birds, but have otherwise received very little scientific attention, said Dr. Thomas Rich, a researcher at Melbourne Museum. Our study is thus the first to comprehensively document these remains, which include new specimens that were examined using cutting edge technologies. Using advanced microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, the team determined the anatomy and preservation of the Koonwarra fossil dinosaur and bird feathers. The Koonwarra feathers are preserved in incredible detail. There are even tiny filament like structures that would have zipped the feather vanes together, just as in the flight feathers of modern birds, said Professor Patricia Vickers Rich, from Monash University and the Swinburne University of Technology. However, unlike the structurally complex feathers of birds today, which are characterized by interlocking branches called barbs and barbules, different kinds of small dinosaurs had coverings that comprised much more simpler hair like proto feathers. Dinosaur proto feathers would have been used for insulation. The discovery of proto feathers at Koonwarra therefore suggests that fluffy feather coats might have helped small dinosaurs keep warm in ancient polar habitats, said Dr. Martin Kundr\u00e1t, of the Pavol Jozef Safarik University. Microscopic remains of possible melanosomes  cellular structures that contain color pigments  were also detected on several Koonwarra feathers. These traces occurred across the uniformly dark feather surfaces, as well as in distinct bands that might represent original patterning from the polar dinosaurs and birds. Melanic residues have been reported on fossil feathers from elsewhere around the world, and are widely acknowledged as indicators of dinosaur coloration. The densely packed fossil melanosomes occurring on the Koonwarra feathers could suggest dark colors that perhaps assisted in camouflage, visual communication, andor heat absorbance in cold polar climates. Possible preservation of biomolecules was also assessed, but proved to be too degraded, and were apparently lost during weathering of the rock. The teams work was published in the journal Gondwana Research.

Ground penetrating radar is a nondestructive method that allows researchers to access hidden information without the need for excavation. The sensor  a kind of antenna  is dragged over the surface, sending a radio wave into the ground. The signal that bounces back gives a picture of whats under the surface. We never thought to look under footprints. But it turns out that the sediment itself has a memory that records the effects of the animals weight and momentum in a beautiful way, said Dr. Thomas Urban, a research scientist in the Department of Classics and Cornell Tree Ring Laboratory at Cornell University. It gives us a way to understand the biomechanics of extinct fauna that we never had before. Dr. Urban and his colleagues from Cornell University, Bournemouth University and the National Park Service examined the footprints of humans, mammoths, giant sloths, canids, felids, bovids and camelids in the White Sands National Monument in New Mexico. Using ground penetrating radar, they were able to resolve 96 of the human tracks in the area under investigation, as well as all of the larger vertebrate tracks. But there are bigger implications than just this case study, Dr. Urban said. The technique could possibly be applied to many other fossilized footprint sites around the world, potentially including those of dinosaurs. We have already successfully tested the method more broadly at multiple locations within White Sands. While these ghost footprints can become invisible for a short time after rain and when conditions are just right, now, using geophysics methods, they can be recorded, traced and investigated in 3D to reveal Pleistocene animal and human interactions, history and mechanics in genuinely exciting new ways, said Professor Sturt Manning, also from the Department of Classics and Cornell Tree Ring Laboratory at Cornell University.

Both insects and flowering plants were common during the mid Cretaceous epoch, but physical evidence for Cretaceous insect pollination of flowering plants was until now absent. An international team of paleontologists from the United States and China has now found an ancient beetle with pollen grains still stuck to its legs trapped in a 99 million year old piece of Burmese amber. Its exceedingly rare to find a specimen where both the insect and the pollen are preserved in a single fossil, said Indiana Universitys Professor David Dilcher. Professor Dilcher and colleagues used optical microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and X ray microcomputed tomography micro CT to reveal the morphology of the insect and pollen grains. The insect in the amber is a previously unknown species of a tumbling flower beetle family Mordellidae, which the researchers named Angimordella burmitina. The beetles role as a pollinator was determined based upon several specialized physical structures, including body shape and pollen feeding mouthparts. Aside from the significance as earliest known direct evidence of insect pollination of flowering plants, this specimen perfectly illustrates the cooperative evolution of plants and animals during this time period, during which a true exposition of flowering plants occurred, Professor Dilcher noted. The pollen was not easy to find. The powdery substance was revealed hidden in the insects body hairs under a confocal laser scanning microscopy. The analysis took advantage of the fact that pollen grains glow under fluorescence light, contrasting strongly with the darkness of the insects shell. The shape and structure of the pollen shows it evolved to spread through contact with insects. These features include the pollens size, ornamentation and clumping ability, Professor Dilcher said. The grains also likely originated from a flower species in the group eudicots, one of the most common types of flowering plant species. Prior to this study, the earliest physical evidence of insect pollination of flowering plants came from the mid Eocene epoch. The prior earliest direct evidence of insect pollination of angiosperm was reported from several pollen collection bees from the middle Eocene of Eckfeld and Messel 48 and 45 million years old, respectively in Germany, Professor Dilcher and co authors said. Our finding thereby extends the known geological range of direct evidence of insect pollination of angiosperm by at least 50 million years.

Pliosaurs were a type of short necked plesiosaur marine reptiles built for speed compared to their long necked cousins. They lived between 220 million years ago Triassic period and 70 million years ago Cretaceous period and were mostly found in the prehistoric seas that covered modern day Europe. Also known as pliosauroids, pliosaurs were not dinosaurs, but distant cousins of modern turtles. They had four powerful flipper like limbs, large crocodile like heads, extremely powerful jaws and enormous teeth, and hunted fish, cephalopod mollusks and other marine reptiles. They reached lengths of up to 50 feet 15 m, which exceeds the size of the largest toothed whales today. Pliosaurs were amongst the largest marine animals of their time, and were at the top of the food chain, said Dr. Sven Sachs, a researcher at the Natural History Museum Bielefeld. In a new study, Dr. Sachs and his colleagues from Switzerland and Sweden analyzed a partial jaw of a large bodied plesiosaur that lived during the Jurassic period. The specimen was collected by the fossil enthusiast Dr. Hans Holenweg from the Passwang Formation near Arisdorf in the Basel Land canton of Switzerland. At around 170 million years old, the Arisdorf jaw represents one of the oldest occurrences of very large pliosaur apex predators in the fossil record, and may have come from an animal that was around 30 feet 9 m long, said Dr. Benjamin Kear, a paleontologist at Uppsala University. Only the rear section of the Arisdorf jaw was recovered, but it has a total length of 1.6 feet 0.5 m. The paleontologists estimate that the jaw was approximately 5 feet 1.5 m long when complete. The Arisdorf pliosaur is the first find of its kind from Switzerland, and comes from a geological timeframe with a hitherto very sparse fossil record of pliosaurs and their relatives, said Dr. Christian Klug, a scientist at the University of Zurich. The study was published in the Swiss Journal of Palaeontology.

Named Danuvius guggenmosi, the ancient great ape lived during the Miocene period, 11.62 million years ago. The primate was about 3.3 feet 1 m in height. Females weighed about 18 kg, less than any great ape alive today, males had a mass of about 31 kg, also at the low extreme of modern great ape body size. The fossilized remains from at least four individuals of Danuvius guggenmosi a male, two females and a juvenile were unearthed in the Hammerschmiede clay pit in the Allg\u00e4u region of Bavaria between 2015 and 2018. The most complete skeleton belonged to a male and had body proportions similar to modern day bonobos. Thanks to completely preserved limb bones, vertebra, finger and toe bones, Professor Madelaine B\u00f6hme from the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment at the University of T\u00fcbingen and colleagues were able to reconstruct the way Danuvius guggenmosi moved about in its environment. For the first time, we were able to investigate several functionally important joints, including the elbow, hip, knee and ankle, in a single fossil skeleton of this age, Professor B\u00f6hme said. It was astonishing for us to realize how similar certain bones are to humans, as opposed to great apes. The teams findings indicate that Danuvius guggenmosi could walk on two legs and could also climb like an ape. The spine, with its S shaped curve, held the body upright when standing on two legs. The animals build, posture, and the ways in which it moved are unique among primates. Danuvius guggenmosi combines the hindlimb dominated bipedality of humans with the forelimb dominated climbing typical of living apes, said Professor David Begun, a researcher at the University of Toronto. These results suggest that human bipedality evolved in arboreal context over 12 million years ago. In contrast to later hominins, Danuvius guggenmosi had a powerful, opposable big toe, which enabled it to grasp large and small branches securely, said Professor Nikolai Spassov, from the Bulgarian Academy of Science. The ribcage was broad and flat, and the lower back was elongated this helped to position the center of gravity over extended hips, knees and flat feet, as in bipeds. The results are supported by a recent study of the hip bone from the 10 million year old ape Rudapithecus hungaricus found in Hungary. That fossil also indicates that the European ancestors of African apes and humans differed from living gorillas and chimpanzees, Professor Begun said. The study was published in the journal Nature.

Microfossils provide information about the antiquity of life on Earth and the nature of the early biosphere, however some mystery still surrounds how they were preserved. It generally thought that many of the oldest microfossils formed when silica grew on their cell walls encasing the microorganism. When the microorganism died, their cells rapidly decayed, leaving behind only traces of carbon in a hollow cavity that molded the shape of the organism. Professor Birger Rasmussen from the University of Western Australia and the China University of Geosciences and University of Western Australias Dr. Janet Muhling worked on the 340 million year old Red Dog zinc lead deposit in northern Alaska, the United States. They found the carbon filling of semi hollow microfossils was not derived from the original organism but from migrated oil. We found that oil infiltration of silica entombed bacteria was responsible for producing the structures, which resembled many of the oldest microfossils preserved in the rock record, Professor Rasmussen said. Using high resolution electron microscopes, we found microfossils located around oil carrying fractures were black and filled by a thin film of carbon. In contrast, microfossils between the fractures contained little or no internal carbon and were virtually invisible. The formation of carbon rich microfossils around fractures suggested oil moving through the cracks in the rock had seeped into the semi hollow molds left after the bacteria died. What we have found is a new process of fossilization, Professor Rasmussen said. We are now looking at rock samples from other localities to examine what role oil might have played in the preservation of microfossils on the early Earth. The results may have implications for how we assess whether ancient microstructures are signs of life on early Earth and how we might detect biosignatures on Mars and other rocky planets.

The fossils were originally discovered by schoolteacher Joan Hodgins and her students in 1973. In the Yukon, we have truckloads of fossils from ice age mammals like woolly mammoths, ancient horses and ferocious lions, said Dr. Grant Zazula, a paleontologist with Yukon Government. But this is the first time we have any evidence for ancient mammals, like rhinos, that pre date the Ice Age. During the Tertiary period, a span of time that began after the dinosaurs went extinct and ended about 2.6 million years ago, a land bridge called Beringia connected what are today Siberia and Alaska. Paleontologists believe that animals of all sorts, including mammoths and rhinos, poured over that bridge. The geology and environment of the Yukon, which sat at the center of that mass migration route, isnt conducive to preserving fossils from land animals. We know that a land bridge must have been in operation throughout much of the last 66 million years, said Dr. Jaelyn Eberle, a curator of fossil vertebrates at the University of Colorado Boulders Museum of Natural History. The catch is finding fossils in the right place at the right time. The team used a scanning electron microscope to analyze the structure of enamel in the fossil tooth fragments. Mammal teeth arent all built alike, Dr. Eberle explained. The crystals that make up enamel can grow following different patterns in different types of animals, a bit like a dental fingerprint. The Yukon tooth enamel carried the tell tale signs of coming from a rhinoceros relative. The method isnt detailed enough to determine the precise species of rhino. But, if this animal was anything like its contemporaries to the south, it may have been about the same size or smaller than todays black rhinos and browsed on leaves for sustenance, Dr. Eberle said. It also probably didnt have a horn on its snout. The paleontologists also looked at a collection of fossils found alongside the rhinos tooth chips. They belonged to two species of turtle, an ancient deer relative and a pike fish. The discovery of the turtles, in particular, indicated that the Yukon had a warmer and wetter climate than it does today. Hodgins, now retired, is excited to see what became of the fossils she and her students discovered 46 years ago Its just so wonderful to learn what has developed with them from long ago.

Dinosaur fossils are well known from Alaska, mostly from Denali National Park and the North Slope, but there are very few records of dinosaurs from the Alaskan Peninsula in the southwest part of the state. In this new study, a team of paleontologists led by Dr. Anthony Fiorillo from the Perot Museum of Nature and Science found and analyzed dinosaur trackways in Aniakchak National Monument, located approximately 416 miles 670 km southwest of the city of Anchorage, Alaska. The trackways were preserved in Chignik Formation, a series of coastal sediment deposits dating back to the Late Cretaceous epoch, around 66 million years ago. Dr. Fiorillo and colleagues identified over 75 new track sites including dozens of dinosaur footprints. Most of the combined record of tracks can be attributed to hadrosaurs, the plant eating duck billed dinosaurs. Tracks range in size from those made by full grown adults to juveniles, they said. Other tracks can be attributed to armored dinosaurs, meat eating dinosaurs, and two kinds of fossil birds. The track size of the predatory dinosaur suggests a body approximately 20 23 feet 6 7 m long, about the estimated size of the North Slope tyrannosaurid Nanuqsaurus. Previous research on dinosaur remains from northern Alaska found that hadrosaurs were most abundant in coastal habitats. The trackways documented in this study reveal that the same trend was true in southern Alaska. Understanding habitat preferences in these animals will contribute to understanding of how ecosystems changed through time as environmental conditions shifted and dinosaurs migrated across northern corridors between continents, the researchers said. Our study shows us something about habitat preferences for some dinosaurs and also that duck billed dinosaurs were incredibly abundant, Dr. Fiorillo said. Hadrosaurs were as commonplace as cows, though given we are working in Alaska, perhaps it is better to consider them the caribou of the Cretaceous.

Up until now, most scientists believed that the catastrophe was caused by the release of volcanic carbon dioxide with global warming as a consequence. According to new research, the increased concentrations of mercury  the most genotoxic element on Earth  contributed to the end Triassic crisis. Prior to industrialism, volcanic activity was the major release mechanism of large amounts of mercury from the Earths crust, said Aarhus University researcher Hamed Sanei, co author of the study. That makes it possible to use mercury in sediments to trace major volcanic activity in the Earths past and in extent tie the extinctions of fossil organisms to large igneous province LIP volcanism. Previous studies found elevated mercury concentrations in Triassic Jurassic boundary sediments over a very large area stretching from Argentina to Greenland and from Nevada to Austria and that made us curious about the impact on the end Triassic event. We decided to examine whether mercury could have played a role. The scientists analyzed fossil fern spores from core samples dating to the end Triassic mass extinction and found a link between the increased mercury levels and mutations in the spores. This rise in mutations happened during a period of increased volcanic activity in a LIP called the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province leading to rising mercury levels. By looking at fern spores in sediments from the mass extinction, it was evident that these ferns were negatively affected by the mercury levels, said lead author Dr. Sofie Lindstr\u00f6m, from the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. Since mercury is accumulated in the food chain, it seems likely that other species have suffered as well. These results suggest that the end Triassic mass extinction was not just caused by greenhouse gases from volcanoes causing global climate change, but that they also emitted toxins such as mercury wreaking havoc. The findings were published in the journal Science Advances.

Ampyx priscus were between 16 and 22 mm long and had a stout spine at the front of their bodies and a pair of very long spines at the back. In each cluster of trilobites examined by Dr. Vannier and co authors, individuals were arranged in a line, with the front of their bodies facing in the same direction, maintaining contact via their spines. Given the scale of the patterns seen, this consistent linearity and directionality is unlikely to be the result of passive transportation or accumulation by currents, the researchers said. Instead, it is more likely that Ampyx priscus were killed suddenly while traveling, for example by being buried rapidly by sediment during a storm. The study authors suggest that Ampyx priscus were probably migrating in groups and used their long spines to maintain a single row formation by physical contacts. This may have been a stress response to disturbance of their environment by storms, detected by motion and touch sensors, which motivated Ampyx priscus to migrate to quieter and deeper waters, they said. A comparable behavior is seen in present day spiny lobsters. Alternatively, the pattern may have been the result of a seasonal reproductive behavior involving the migration of sexually mature individuals to spawning grounds. Knowing that Ampyx priscus were blind, they may have coordinated using sensory stimulation via spines and chemicals, the scientists said. The discovery shows that a 480 million year old arthropod may have used its neural complexity to develop a temporary collective behavior.

Dubbed Parmastega aelidae, the ancient creature lived about 372 million years ago\u00a0Devonian period and was an aquatic, surface cruising animal. The first tetrapods evolved from fishes during the Devonian period, which ended about 360 million years ago, said lead author Dr. Per Erik Ahlberg of Uppsala University and colleagues. For many decades, our idea of what they were like has been based on just a few genera, chiefly Ichthyostega and Acanthostega. Most other Devonian tetrapods are known only from a few scraps of jaws or limb bones enough to show that they existed, but not really enough to tell us anything useful. Furthermore, Ichthyostega and Acanthostega lived at the very end of the Devonian period. Some of the fragmentary tetrapods are a lot older, up to 373 million years old, and the oldest fossil tetrapod footprints date back a whopping 390 million years. So Devonian tetrapods have a long early history about which, until now, we have known very little. Parmastega aelidae changes all this. The fossilized remains of Parmastega aelidae were recovered from the Sosnogorsk Formation, a limestone formed in a tropical coastal lagoon, which is now exposed on the banks of the Izhma River in the Komi Republic. They are only marginally younger than the oldest fragmentary tetrapod bones. Fish like characteristics in some bones indicate that Parmastega aelidae is not only the earliest but also the most primitive of the well preserved Devonian tetrapods. And what a strange creature it is, the paleontologists said. Like other Devonian tetrapods, Parmastega aelidae is vaguely crocodile like in shape, but its eyes are raised above the top of the head, and the curve of its snout and lower jaw create a disconcerting grin that reveals its formidable teeth. A clue to its lifestyle is provided by the lateral line canals, sensory organs for detecting vibrations in the water, which it inherited from its fish ancestors. These canals are well developed on the lower jaw, the snout and the sides of the face, but they die out on top of the head behind the eyes. This probably means that it spent a lot of time hanging around at the surface of the water, with the top of the head just awash and the eyes protruding into the air. But why? Crocodiles do this today, because they are keeping an eye out for land animals that they might want to catch. We dont know very much about the land that surrounded Parmastega aelidaes lagoon, but there may have been large arthropods such as millipedes or sea scorpions to catch at the waters edge. Parmastega aelidaes slender, elastic lower jaw looks well suited to scooping prey off the ground, its needle like teeth contrasting with the robust fangs of the upper jaw that would have been driven into the prey by the body weight. The fossil material springs one final surprise the shoulder girdle was made partly from cartilage, which is softer than bone, and the vertebral column and limbs may have been entirely cartilaginous as they are not preserved, the researchers said. This strongly suggests that Parmastega aelidae, with its crocodile like head and protruding eyes, never really left the water. Did it creep up on prey at the waters edge and surge onto the shore to seize it in its jaws, only to then slide back into the supporting embrace of the water? We dont know. Far from presenting a progressive cavalcade of ever more land adapted animals, the origin of tetrapods is looking more and more like a tangled bush of ecological experimentation. The findings were published in the October 24, 2019 issue of the journal Nature.

Debate lingers over what caused this extinction event, with intense volcanic activity in Indias Deccan Traps and the asteroid strike off Mexicos Yucatan Peninsula the most widely supported hypotheses. Now, a team of researchers has found the first direct evidence that the asteroid impact coincided with a sharp drop in the pH levels of the oceans and was key in driving the mass extinction. For years, people suggested there would have been a decrease in ocean pH because the meteor impact hit sulfur rich rocks and caused the raining out of sulfuric acid, but until now no one had any direct evidence to show this happened, said Dr. Michael Henehan, a scientist at GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences. In the study, Dr. Henehan and colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of foraminifera  tiny plankton that grow a calcite shell  from before, during, and after the end Cretaceous mass extinction event. Specifically, measurements of boron isotopes in foraminifera shells allowed the team to detect changes in the oceans acidity. We found decisive data for this during an excursion to the Netherlands, where a particularly thick layer of end Cretaceous rocks is preserved in a cave, the scientists explained. In this cave, an especially thick layer of clay from the immediate aftermath of the impact accumulated, which is really quite rare, Dr. Henehan added. In most settings, sediment accumulates so slowly that such a rapid event such as an asteroid impact is hard to resolve in the rock record. Because so much sediment was laid down there at once, it meant we could extract enough fossils to analyze, and we were able to capture the transition. The ocean acidification we observe could easily have been the trigger for mass extinction in the marine realm, said Dr. Pincelli Hull, a researcher at Yale University. Meanwhile, the teams boron isotope analysis and modeling techniques may have reconciled some competing theories and puzzling facts relating to ocean life after the mass extinction event. Why, for example, are carbon isotope signatures immediately after the asteroid impact identical in fossil material from the sea floor and the surface waters, when normal carbon cycling in oceans should lead to different signatures? One theory, the Strangelove Ocean theory, argued that for a time after the event, the ocean was essentially dead and the normal carbon cycle just stopped. The problem with this theory, according to some researchers, is that many organisms on the sea floor that rely on food sinking from the oceans surface continued unharmed across the event  an unlikely occurrence in a dead ocean. Another popular theory, called the Living Ocean, suggested that the event killed off larger plankton species, disrupting the carbon cycle by making it harder for organic matter to sink to the deep sea, but allowed for some marine life to survive. This new study splits the difference. It says the oceans had a major, initial loss of species productivity  by as much as 50  followed by a transitional period in which marine life began to recover. In a way, we reconciled both of these Strangelove and Living Ocean scenarios. Both of them were partially right they just happened in sequence, Dr. Henehan said. The study also may have settled a question regarding ocean pH levels leading up to the mass extinction event. What we can show is that there is no real signal of gradual pH decline in the ocean in the lead up to the end Cretaceous mass extinction, Dr. Henehan said. Our results do not support any major role for volcanic activity in priming the world for extinction. The findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

First scientifically described in 1978, Saurornitholestes langstoni is a carnivorous feathered dinosaur within the family Dromaeosauridae also known as raptors. It lived approximately 76 million years ago Cretaceous period in what is now North America. The species was previously known from fragmentary remains and was long thought to be so closely related to Velociraptor from Mongolia that some paleontologists called it Velociraptor langstoni. The new, almost complete skeleton of Saurornitholestes langstoni was discovered by Clive Coy from the University of Alberta in Dinosaur Provincial Park in 2014. The specimen was remarkably complete and exquisitely preserved, with all the bones except for the tail preserved in life position. Because of their small size and delicate bones, small meat eating dinosaur skeletons are exceptionally rare in the fossil record, said Dr. David Evans, a researcher in the Department of Natural History at the Royal Ontario Museum and the Department of Ecology  Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto. The new skeleton is by far the most complete and best preserved raptor skeleton ever found in North America. Its a scientific goldmine. Dr. Evans and his colleague, University of Albertas Professor Philip Currie, analyzed the new specimen and found that Saurornitholestes langstoni had a shorter and deeper skull than Velociraptor. At the front of the skulls mouth, they also discovered a flat tooth with long ridges, which was likely used for preening feathers. The same tooth has since been identified in Velociraptor and other dromaeosaurids. The team also established a distinction between dromaeosaurids in North America and Asia. The new anatomical information we have clearly shows that the North American dromaeosaurids are a separate lineage from the Asian dromaeosaurids, although they do have a common ancestor, Professor Currie said. This changes our understanding of intercontinental movements of these animals and ultimately will help us understand their evolution. The teams paper was published in the journal Anatomical Record. "}, {"title": " Giant Dinosaurs Evolved Various Brain-Cooling Mechanisms: Study", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Oct 17, 2019", "doc": "Different groups of gigantic dinosaurs had different thermoregulatory strategies to help moderate brain temperatures in the face of high heat loads, according to new research from the Ohio Universitys Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine. Small dinosaurs could have just run into the shade to cool off, but for giant dinosaurs, the potential for overheating was literally inescapable, said Professor Lawrence Witmer, co author of the study. They must have had special mechanisms to control brain temperature, but what were they? Professor Witmer and his colleague, Dr. Ruger Porter, looked to the modern day relatives of dinosaurs, birds and reptiles, where studies indeed showed that evaporation of moisture in the nose, mouth, and eyes cooled the blood on its way to the brain. Using a technique that allows arteries and veins to show up in CT scans, they were able to trace blood flow from the sites of evaporative cooling to the brain. They also precisely measured the bony canals and grooves that conveyed the blood vessels. The handy thing about blood vessels is that they basically write their presence into the bones, said Dr. Porter, lead author of the study. The bony canals and grooves that we see in modern day birds and reptiles are our link to the dinosaur fossils. We can use this bony evidence to restore the patterns of blood flow in extinct dinosaurs and hopefully get a glimpse into their thermal physiology and how they dealt with heat.  The researchers looked at bony canal sizes in the dinosaurs to assess the relative importance of the different sites of evaporative cooling based on how much blood was flowing through them. A key factor turned out to be body size. Smaller dinosaurs such as the goat sized pachycephalosaur Stegoceras had a very balanced vascular pattern with no single cooling region being particularly emphasized. That makes physiological sense because smaller dinosaurs have less of a problem with overheating, Dr. Porter said. But giants like sauropods and ankylosaurs increased blood flow to particular cooling regions of the head far beyond what was necessary to simply nourish the tissues. This unbalanced vascular pattern allowed the thermal strategies of large dinosaurs to be more focused, emphasizing one or more cooling regions. But although sauropods like Diplodocus and Camarasaurus and ankylosaurs like Euoplocephalus all had unbalanced vascular patterns emphasizing certain cooling regions, they still differed. Sauropods emphasized both the nasal cavity and mouth as cooling regions whereas ankylosaurs only emphasized the nose. Its possible that sauropods were so large  often weighing dozens of tons  that they needed to recruit the mouth as a cooling region in times of heat stress. Panting sauropods may have been a common sight, Dr. Porter said. One problem that the scientists encountered was that many of the theropod dinosaurs  such as the 10 ton T. rex  were also gigantic, but the quantitative analysis showed that they had a balanced vascular pattern, like the small bodied dinosaurs. This finding had us scratching our heads until we noticed the obvious difference  theropods like Majungasaurus and T. rex had a huge air sinus in their snouts, Professor Witmer said. Looking closer, the team discovered bony evidence that this antorbital air sinus was richly supplied with blood vessels. Profeesor Witmer had previously shown that air circulated through the antorbital air sinus like a bellows pump every time the animal opened and closed its mouth. Boom An actively ventilated, highly vascular sinus meant that we had another potential cooling region. Theropod dinosaurs solved the same problem but in a different way, he said. The findings appear in the journal Anatomical Record.

Stingrays order Myliobatiformes are a very diverse group of cartilaginous fishes comprising more than 360 extant species arranged in 11 families, explained Dr. Giuseppe Marrama, a paleontologist with the Institute of Paleontology at the University of Vienna, and colleagues. They are known for their venomous and serrated tail stings, which they use against other predatory fish, and occasionally against humans. They have a rounded or wing like pectoral disc and a long, whip like tail that carries one or more serrated and venomous stings. Fossil remains of stingrays are very common, especially their isolated teeth. Complete skeletons, however, exist only from a few extinct species coming from particular fossil sites. Among these, the rich fossil site near Bolca in northeastern Italy is one of the best known. Dr. Marrama and co authors found three nearly complete specimens of a previously unknown stingray species at the Bolca site. Named Lessiniabatis aenigmatica, the creature lived some 50 million years ago Eocene epoch in the waters of the western Tethys Ocean. It had a flattened body and a pectoral disc ovoid in shape. What is striking is the absence of sting and the extremely short tail, which was not long as in the other stingrays and didnt protrude posteriorly to the disc. This unique body plan is unknown in other extinct or living species of stingrays. More than 70 of the organisms, such as dinosaurs, marine reptiles, several mammal groups, numerous birds, fish and invertebrates, disappeared during the fifth largest extinction event in the Earths history that occurred about 66 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, the researchers said. In marine environments, the time after this event is characterized by the emergence and diversification of new species and entire groups of bony and cartilaginous fishes sharks and rays, which reoccupied the ecological niches left vacant by the extinctions victims. From this perspective, the emergence of a new body plan in a 50 million year old stingray such as Lessiniabatis aenigmatica is particularly intriguing when viewed in the context of simultaneous, extensive diversification and emergence of new anatomical features within several fish groups, during the recovery of the life after the end Cretaceous extinction event, Dr. Marrama said.

Dubbed Siamraptor suwati by its discoverers, the newly discovered dinosaur lived approximately 120 million years ago Cretaceous period. The ancient creature was a member of Carcharodontosauria, a group of large carnivorous dinosaurs from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. In fact, Siamraptor suwati is the oldest carcharodontosaurian dinosaur known and is the first of its kind from Southeast Asia. The fossilized remains of at least four Siamraptor suwati individuals  skull, backbone, limbs, and hips  were recovered from the Khok Kruat Formation in Nakhon Ratchasima province, Thailand. The fossils were analyzed by Dr. Duangsuda Chokchaloemwong of Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University and her colleagues from Thailand and Japan. The phylogenetic analyses revealed that Siamraptor suwati is a basal species of Carcharodontosauria, involving a new sight of the paleobiogeographical context of this group, the paleontologists said. Siamraptor suwati is the best preserved carcharodontosaurian theropod in Southeast Asia, and it sheds new light on the early evolutionary history of Carcharodontosauria.

Nicknamed mold pigs, these tiny creatures lived some 30 million years ago Paleogene period and had features of both mites and tardigrades. There is no extant group that the mold pigs fit into, and we have no knowledge of any of their descendants living today, said Professor George Poinar Jr., an entomologist at the Oregon State University College of Science. This discovery shows that unique lineages were surviving in the mid Tertiary. The mold pigs were about 100 \u03bcm long and grew by molting their exoskeleton. Scientifically named Sialomorpha dominicana, these creatures had flexible heads and four pairs of legs. They fed mainly on fungi, supplementing that food source with small invertebrates. No claws are present at the end of their legs as they are with tardigrades and mites, Professor Poinar said. Based on what we know about extant and extinct microinvertebrates, Sialomorpha dominicana appears to represent a new phylum. The structure and developmental patterns of these fossils illustrate a time period when certain traits appeared among these types of animals. But we dont know when the Sialomorpha lineage originated, how long it lasted, or whether there are descendants living today. The mold pigs shared warm, moist surroundings with pseudoscorpions, nematodes, fungi and protozoa. Every now and then well find small, fragile, previously unknown fossil invertebrates in specialized habitats, Professor Poinar said. And occasionally, as in the present case, a fragment of the original habitat from millions of years ago is preserved too. The mold pigs cant be placed in any group of currently existing invertebrates  they share characteristics with both tardigrades and mites, but clearly belong to neither group. The discovery is described in a paper in the journal Invertebrate Biology.

They went extinct 3,700 years ago and, according to the frequency of their remains from the island, the extinction was extremely abrupt. In a new study, published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, an international team of researchers has investigated the ecology of the mammoth population on the island and reconstructed the scenario that could have led to their extinction. During the last Ice Age  some 100,000 to 15,000 years ago  mammoths were widespread in the northern hemisphere from Spain to Alaska, said study lead author Dr. Laura Arppe, a scientist at the University of Helsinki, and her colleagues. Due to the global warming that began 15,000 years ago, their habitat in Northern Siberia and Alaska shrank. On Wrangel Island, some mammoths were cut off from the mainland by rising sea levels that population survived another 7,000 years. In the study, the researchers examined the isotope compositions of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and strontium from a large set of mammoth bones and teeth from Northern Siberia, Alaska, the Yukon, and Wrangel Island, ranging from 40,000 to 4,000 years in age. Their aim was to document possible changes in the diet of the mammoths and their habitat, and to find evidence of a disturbance in their environment. The results showed that Wrangel Island mammoths collagen carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions didnt shift as the climate warmed up some 10,000 years ago. The values remained unchanged until the mammoths disappeared, seemingly from the midst of stable, favorable living conditions, they said. The result contrasts with the findings on woolly mammoths from the East European plains, which died out 15,000 years ago, and on the mammoths of St. Paul Island in Alaska, which disappeared 5,600 years ago. In both cases, the last representatives of these populations showed significant changes in their isotopic composition, indicating changes in their environment shortly before they became locally extinct. Earlier studies indicate that the Wrangel Island mammoths suffered mutations affecting their fat metabolism. In this new study, the authors found an intriguing difference between the Wrangel Island mammoths and their Siberian predecessors the carbonate carbon isotope values indicated a difference in the fats and carbohydrates in the populations diets. We think this reflects the tendency of Siberian mammoths to rely on their reserves of fat to survive through the extremely harsh ice age winters, while Wrangel mammoths, living in milder conditions, simply didnt need to, Dr. Arppe said. The bones also contained levels of sulfur and strontium that suggested the weathering of bedrock intensified toward the end of the mammoth populations existence. This may have affected the quality of the mammoths drinking water. Our study shows that Wrangel Island maintained through the Holocene, and possibly until the present day, environmental conditions suitable for a typical mammoth ecological niche, the scientists said. The exact cause of final extinction for the Wrangel Island mammoths remains equivocal, but we suggest it was likely caused by a short term crisis, possibly linked to climatic anomalies orand geochemical factors. Furthermore, anthropogenic influence should not be ruled out despite lack of tangible evidence of hunting.

Pterosaurs were highly successful reptiles  not dinosaurs, as theyre commonly mislabeled. These creatures thrived from about 220 million years ago to 65 million years ago, when they were wiped out by the asteroid that also doomed the nonavian dinosaurs. Some pterosaurs were the largest flying animals of all time, with wingspans exceeding 30 feet 9 m and standing heights comparable to modern giraffes. Ferrodraco lentoni Lentons iron dragon, after the late Mayor of Winton, Graham Lenton had a wingspan of around 13 feet 4\u2009m. The flying reptile lived approximately 96 million years ago, during the Cretaceous period. Its fossilized remains were found near the northeastern margins of the Winton Formation in Queensland by paleontologist Bob Elliott in April 2017. The specimen is the first pterosaur reported from the Winton Formation, and is also the most complete pterosaur ever found in Australia. The skeleton of Ferrodraco lentoni is exceptionally well preserved and comprises five partial vertebrae, eight limb bones, a large portion of the jaw, skull and crest, and 40 isolated and partial teeth, said Adele Pentland, a PhD candidate at the Swinburne University of Technology and the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum. This is the most complete pterosaur that has ever been found in Australia and we have somewhere between 10 to 11 of the skeleton. Ferrodraco lentoni was likely a top aerial predator in its ecosystem. At this time the Winton region was on the southern shores of an inland sea and was globally positioned about where Victorias southern coastline is today, Pentland said.

The Dresser Formation stromatolites have been thought to be of biogenic origin ever since they were discovered in the 1980s. However, despite strong textural evidence, that theory was unproven for nearly four decades, because scientists hadnt been able to show the definitive presence of preserved organic matter remains. This is an exciting discovery  for the first time, were able to show the world that these stromatolites are definitive evidence for the earliest life on Earth, said Dr. Raphael Baumgartner, a researcher at the Australian Centre for Astrobiology at the University of New South Wales and the lead author of a paper published in the journal Geology. The discovery is the closest we have come to a smoking gun to prove the existence of such ancient life, said University of New South Wales Professor Martin Van Kranendonk, co author of the study. This represents a major advance in our knowledge of these rocks, in the science of early life investigations generally, and  more specifically  in the search for life on Mars. We now have a new target and new methodology to search for ancient life traces. These new pieces of critical evidence we have uncovered represent a truly exciting step forward, enabling us to prove the existence of ancient life on our planet, said co author Dr. Marco Fiorentini, from the University of Western Australia. Stromatolites in the Dresser Formation are usually sourced from the rock surface, and are therefore highly weathered. In the new study, the authors worked with samples that were taken from further down into the rock, below the weathering profile, where the stromatolites are exceptionally well preserved. They analyzed the rocks using micro analytical tools and techniques, including high powered electron microscopy, spectroscopy and isotope analysis. They found that the stromatolites are essentially composed of pyrite that contains organic matter. The organic matter that we found preserved within pyrite of the stromatolites is exciting  were looking at exceptionally preserved coherent filaments and strands that are typically remains of microbial biofilms, Dr. Baumgartner said. The results obtained from the ongoing study at the Dresser Formation can be used as a blueprint to inform further research focusing on the analysis of Martian rocks, to ultimately search for clues of early life in the wider Solar System, Dr. Fiorentini said.

Rauisuchians are a group of massive Triassic archosaurs. These animals had huge skulls full of serrated, curved teeth, and a diversity of body shapes and sizes. They are closely related to crocodiles as we know them today, and are generally considered to have gone extinct in the end Triassic mass extinction. In the Triassic period, rauisuchians were widespread and their fossils are known from all continents except Antarctica, said Rick Tolchard, a student in the Evolutionary Studies Institute and School of Geosciences at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. They went extinct about 200 million years ago, paving the way for dinosaurs to become the dominant large land animals. In the study, Tolchard and colleagues analyzed rauisuchian fossils  teeth, pieces of jaws, hind limbs and body armor  from the Elliot Formation of South Africa and Lesotho. The specimens included some of the largest carnivorous members of the group, possibly up to 33 feet 10 m long. These ancient fossils provide us with evidence of how at least two predator species hunted these vegetarian dinosaurs 210 million years ago, Tolchard said. It is amazing to follow the clues left behind in fossilized teeth, jaws, limbs and other fossils to help us tell the ancient story of life in southern Africa. The study shows that the rauisuchians from the Elliot Formation were some of the latest surviving members of their group, and that when they were alive, they were thriving close to the Antarctic Circle  the theoretical limit for their physiology. This study demonstrates the value of re examining old specimens, and now we finally know what was preying on all those herbivorous dinosaurs, said co author Professor Jonah Choiniere, from the Wits Evolutionary Studies Institute.

Dubbed Protodontopteryx ruthae, the ancient seabird belongs to Pelagornithidae, an ancient family of bony toothed birds. These seafaring birds were previously known from late Paleocene to Pliocene fossil sites and some species reached wingspans up to 6.4 m 21 feet. Protodontopteryx ruthae is the oldest, but smallest member in the family. It was only the size of an average gull and, like other pelagornithids, had bony, tooth like projections on the edge of its beak. The partial skeleton of Protodontopteryx ruthae was found by amateur paleontologist Leigh Love at the Waipara Greensand fossil site in 2018. The age of the fossilized bones suggests pelagornithids evolved in the Southern Hemisphere, said Dr. Paul Scofield, a curator at Canterbury Museum and the senior author of a paper published in the journal Papers in Palaeontology. While this bird was relatively small, the impact of its discovery is hugely significant in our understanding of this family. Until we found this skeleton, all the really old pelagornithids had been found in the Northern Hemisphere, so everyone thought theyd evolved up there. New Zealand was a very different place when Protodontopteryx ruthae were in the skies. It had a tropical climate  the sea temperature was about 25 degrees Celsius 77 degrees Fahrenheit so we had corals and giant turtles.  The discovery of Protodontopteryx ruthae was truly amazing and unexpected, said co author Dr. Gerald Mayr, a researcher with the Senckenberg Research Institute and Natural History Museum. Not only is the fossil one of the most complete specimens of a pseudotoothed bird, but it also shows a number of unexpected skeletal features that contribute to a better understanding of the evolution of these enigmatic birds. The skeleton of Protodontopteryx ruthae suggests it was less suited for long distance soaring than later pelagornithids and probably covered much shorter ranges. Its short, broad pseudoteeth were likely designed for catching fish. Later species had needle like pseudoteeth which were likely used to catch soft bodied prey like squid. Because Protodontopteryx ruthae was less adapted to sustained soaring than other known pelagornithids, we can now say that pseudoteeth evolved before these birds became highly specialized gliders, said co author Dr. Vanesa De Pietri, a curator at Canterbury Museum.

Mystriosaurus laurillardi is one of the first marine crocodile fossils ever to be described, said lead author Dr. Sven Sachs, a paleontologist at the Naturkunde Museum Bielefeld. While it received its generic name in 1834, the 3D preserved skull was mentioned in the literature as early as 1776. The fossil that would later be named Mystriosaurus laurillardi was found in a quarry in Altdorf near Nuremberg in southern Germany by Johann Friedrich Bauder. Mystriosaurus laurillardi was more than 13 feet 4 m in length, had a long snout and pointed teeth, and preyed on fish. The prehistoric predator lived around 180 million years ago in warm Jurassic seas alongside other animals including ammonites and ichthyosaurs. Mystriosaurus laurillardi looked like a gharial but it had a shorter snout with its nasal opening facing forwards, whereas in nearly all other fossil and living crocodiles the nasal opening is placed on top of the snout, Dr. Sachs noted. For the past 60 years, it was thought the animal was part of a similar species, known as Steneosaurus bollensis, which existed around the same time. Mystriosaurus laurillardi has been broadly accepted as a valid genus in numerous publications during the 19th and early 20th centuries, Dr. Sachs explained. However, in the 1960s, T\u00fcbingen paleontologist Frank Westphal published two revisions of Early Jurassic teleosauroids and concluded that Mystriosaurus laurillardi was in fact a subjective junior synonym of Steneosaurus bollensis. Dr. Sachs and his team analyzed the new fossils unearthed in the UK and Germany and concluded that Mystriosaurus laurillardi is in fact a distinct species. They also revealed that another skull, discovered in Yorkshire in the 1800s, belongs to Mystriosaurus laurillardi. The discovery of fossils in present day Germany and the UK shows that the species could easily swim between islands, much like modern saltwater crocodiles, they said. Unraveling the complex history and anatomy of fossils like Mystriosaurus laurillardi is necessary if we are to understand the diversification of crocodiles during the Jurassic, said co author Dr. Mark Young, a researcher in the School of GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh. Their rapid increase in biodiversity between 200 and 180 million years ago is still poorly understood. The study was published in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica.

The skull of the extinct kangaroo studied here differs from those of todays kangaroos in many of the ways a giant pandas skull differs from other bears, said Dr. Rex Mitchell, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Arkansas and the University of New England. So, it seems that the strange skull of this kangaroo was, in a functional sense, less like a modern day kangaroos and more like a giant pandas. Dr. Mitchell used computed tomography scans to create 3D models of the skull of Simosthenurus occidentalis. Working with the models, he performed bite simulations to examine biomechanical performance. The resulting forces at the jaw joints and biting teeth were measured, as well as stress experienced across the skull during biting. The researcher compared the findings from the short faced kangaroo to those obtained from models of the koala Phascolarctos cinereus, a species alive today with the most similar skull shape. These comparisons demonstrated the importance of Simosthenurus occidentalis bony, heavily reinforced skull features in producing and withstanding strong forces during biting, which likely helped the animal crush thick, resistant vegetation such as the older leaves, woody twigs and branches of trees and shrubs. This would be quite different than the feeding habits of modern Australian kangaroos, which tend to feed mostly on grasses, and would instead be more similar to how giant pandas crush bamboo. The short face, large teeth, and broad attachment sites for biting muscles found in the skulls of the short faced kangaroo and the giant panda are an example of convergent evolution, meaning these features probably evolved in both animals for the purpose of performing similar feeding tasks, Dr. Mitchell said.

Cryodrakon boreas lived about 77 million years ago and had a wingspan of 33 feet 10 m. The flying reptile belongs to Azhdarchidae, a family of pterosaurs known primarily from the Late Cretaceous epoch. Its fossilized remains  consisting of a skeleton that has part of the wings, legs, neck and a rib  were discovered three decades ago, but paleontologists had assumed they belonged to Quetzalcoatlus, an already known species of pterosaur discovered in Texas. This is a cool discovery, we knew this animal was here but now we can show it is different to other azhdarchids and so it gets a name, said lead author Dr. David Hone, from the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences at Queen Mary University of London. This type of pterosaur azhdarchids is quite rare, and most specimens are just a single bone. Our new species is represented by a partial skeleton. This tells us a great deal about the anatomy of these large flyers, how they flew, and how they lived, said Dr. Michael Habib, from the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California and the Dinosaur Institute of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Like other azhdarchids, Cryodrakon boreas was carnivorous and predominantly predated on small animals which would likely include lizards, mammals and even baby dinosaurs. It is great that we can identify Cryodrakon boreas as being distinct to Quetzalcoatlus as it means we have a better picture of the diversity and evolution of predatory pterosaurs in North America, Dr. Hone said. This particular group of pterosaurs includes the largest flying animals of all time. Their anatomy holds important clues about the limits of animal flight and may be important in the future for biologically inspired mechanical design for flight, Dr. Habib added. Unlike most pterosaur groups, azhdarchids are known primarily from terrestrial settings and, despite their likely capacity to cross oceanic distances in flight, they are broadly considered to be animals that were adapted for, and lived in, inland environments, the researchers said. Despite their large size and a distribution across North and South America, Asia, Africa and Europe, few azhdarchids are known from more than fragmentary remains. This makes Cryodrakon boreas an important animal since it has very well preserved bones and includes multiple individuals of different sizes. The discovery is reported in a paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

The newly identified dinosaur, named Kamuysaurus japonicus, lived some 72 million years ago Cretaceous period. It belongs to the family Hadrosauridae, one of the most successful groups of herbivorous dinosaurs in the Late Cretaceous epoch. The fossil remains of these dinosaurs are common in the uppermost Cretaceous deposits in the supercontinent Laurasia North America, Asia, and Europe and some areas of the supercontinent Gondwana South America and Antarctica. The nearly complete skeleton of Kamuysaurus japonicus was recovered from the outer shelf deposits of the Upper Cretaceous Hakobuchi Formation in Hobetsu area of Mukawa town in Hokkaido in 2013. It is the first nearly complete mid to large sized dinosaur skeleton from Japan. The specimen was analyzed by paleontologists from Japan, the United States and Mongolia who concluded the dinosaur belonged to the hadrosaurid clade Edmontosaurini and was closely related to other hadrosaurids from the Far East such as Laiyangosaurus from China and Kerberosaurus from Siberia. The individual was an adult aged 9 or older, measured 26 feet 8 m long and weighed 4 or 5.3 tons  depending on whether it was walking on two or four legs respectively  when it was alive, said lead author Professor Yoshitsugu Kobayashi from the Hokkaido University Museum and colleagues. The researchers also identified a number of unique features, including a small crest on the skull and a short row of neural spines that point forwards. We found that Kamuysaurus japonicus has three unique characteristics that are not shared by other dinosaurs in the Edmontosaurini clade the low position of the cranial bone notch, the short ascending process of the jaw bone, and the anterior inclination of the neural spines of the sixth to twelfth dorsal vertebrae, they explained. According to the team, the discovery of Kamuysaurus japonicus in a marine influenced environment is rare for hadrosaurids and contributes to understanding of their diversity in these environments. There is a possibility that the ancestors of the Hadrosauridae family and its subfamilies, Hadrosaurinae and Lambeosaurinae, preferred to inhabit areas near the ocean, suggesting the coastline environment was an important factor in the diversification of the hadrosaurids in its early evolution, especially in North America, the scientists said. The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal Scientific Reports.

T. rex had two large holes  called the dorsotemporal fenestra  in the roof of its skull. In the past, paleontologists believed these holes were filled with muscles that assist with jaw movements. The new study suggests blood vessels in the dorsotemporal fenestra acted as an internal thermostat, much like alligators have today for body temperature control. Its really weird for a muscle to come up from the jaw, make a 90 degree turn, and go along the roof of the skull, said University of Missouris Professor Casey Holliday, lead author of the study. Yet, we now have a lot of compelling evidence for blood vessels in this area, based on our work with alligators and other reptiles. Using thermal imaging, Professor Holliday and colleagues examined alligators at the St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park in Florida. An alligators body heat depends on its environment, said co author Dr. Kent Vliet, a researcher in the Department of Biology at the University of Florida. Therefore, we noticed when it was cooler and the alligators are trying to warm up, our thermal imaging showed big hot spots in these holes in the roof of their skull, indicating a rise in temperature. Yet, later in the day when its warmer, the holes appear dark, like they were turned off to keep cool. This is consistent with prior evidence that alligators have a cross current circulatory system  or an internal thermostat, so to speak. The scientists then took their thermal imaging data and examined fossilized remains of dinosaurs and crocodiles to see how these holes in the skull changed over time. We know that, similarly to the T. rex, alligators have holes on the roof of their skulls, and they are filled with blood vessels, said Ohio Universitys Professor Larry Witmer, co author of the study. Yet, for over 100 years weve been putting muscles into a similar space with dinosaurs. By using some anatomy and physiology of current animals, we can show that we can overturn those early hypotheses about the anatomy of this part of the T. rexs skull.

Pterosaurs were a diverse group of flying reptiles that were the first among tetrapods to evolve powered flight. They originated in the Late Triassic epoch and constituted an important part of Mesozoic era ecosystems until their extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period. During this period of time, pterosaurs adapted to diverse lifestyles and feeding habits. Direct evidence on their diets such as gut contents, however, is rare and only known from a few pterosaur species. Coprolites fossilized droppings are surprisingly common fossils and they potentially hold valuable information on the diet of extinct animals. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to know which animal produced which dropping. In the new study, Martin Qvarnstr\u00f6m and his colleagues from Uppsala University and the Institute of Paleobiology at the Polish Academy of Sciences analyzed the contents of three coprolites collected at the Wierzbica Quarry in Poland, a paleontological site known for abundant pterosaur footprints. The coprolites size, shape and association to the tracks suggest that they were produced by pterosaurs, most probably belonging to a group called Ctenochasmatidae. The synchrotron microtomography scans of the specimens revealed microscopic food remains, including foraminifera, small shells of marine invertebrates and possible remains of polychaete worms. A reasonable explanation for how a pterosaur big enough to have produced the droppings ingested such small prey is through filter feeding, Qvarnstr\u00f6m said. Pterodaustro, a species of pterosaur that lived during the Cretaceous period, and is thus slightly younger than the coprolites from Poland, possessed a sieving basket consisting of many long, thin teeth and was certainly a filter feeder. Older ctenochasmids did not possess such an obvious sieving basket, but some had elongated snouts with many slender teeth, also interpreted as adaptations for filter feeding. These pterosaurs were around at the time the coprolites were made, and as the footprints from the site have also been attributed to ctenochasmids it is likely that such pterosaurs produced both the droppings and the footprints. The modern Chilean flamingo, which is a filter feeder, can produce droppings full of foraminifera when feeding in coastal wetland. The similar contents of the droppings of these flamingos and the pterosaur coprolites could be explained by similar feeding environments and mesh sizes of the filter feeding apparatus, Qvarnstr\u00f6m said. It appears therefore that the pterosaurs which produced the footprints and droppings found in Poland were indeed the flamingos of the Late Jurassic. The study was published in the journal PeerJ.

The extinct mammal relative, named Pseudotherium argentinus, lived during the Triassic period, about 231 million years ago. Pseudotherium argentinus lived in an environment warmer than today, with abundant flora mostly made up of ferns and conifers, since there were no flowering plants during its time, said Dr. Ricardo Mart\u00ednez, a paleontologist with the Institute and Museum of Natural Sciences at the University of San Juan. The ancient animal was about 10 inches 25 cm long and had very long fangs. The species had a very long, flat, and shallow snout, and its very long fangs located almost at the tip of the snout, so the resemblance to Scrat, the renowned squirrel like character with saber teeth in the Ice Age movies, is tremendous, Dr. Mart\u00ednez said. His long fangs could have served him on one hand, to nail and trap insects or prey, but another option is that this animal has been a male and we are in the presence of sexual dimorphism, that is, that the males of this species had developed these great fangs as a way to attract females. But, at this point, you cant know much, because we only have one specimen.  The well preserved skull of Pseudotherium argentinus was found at the Valle Pintado locality of the Ischigualasto Formation. Dr. Mart\u00ednez and colleagues used high resolution CT scans of the specimen to study its internal structure. With these images, we could observe the developed inner ear, the loss of the post orbital bar, as well as the presence of the turbinals that are like partitions that allowed this animal to heat the air entering its respiratory system, which would indicate that he had hot blood, Dr. Mart\u00ednez said. A paper on the discovery was published in the journal PLoS ONE.

Their results show that oxygen levels in these rocks leapt by nearly a third in just a couple of million years, possibly setting the scene for a dinosaur expansion into the tropics of North America and elsewhere. We tested rocks from the Colorado Plateau and the Newark Basin that formed at the same time about 621 miles 1,000 km apart on the supercontinent of Pangea, said Rensselaer Polytechnic Institutes Professor Morgan Schaller, lead author of the study. Our results show that over a period of around 3 million years, the oxygen levels in the atmosphere jumped from around 15 to around 19. For comparison, there is 21 oxygen in todays atmosphere. We really dont know what might have caused this increase, but we also see a drop in carbon dioxide levels at that time. We expect that this change in oxygen concentration would have been global change, and in fact we found the change in samples which were 621 miles apart, he said. What is remarkable is that right at the oxygen peak we see the first dinosaurs appearing in the North American tropics, Chindesaurus. The sauropods followed soon afterwards. Again, we cant yet say if this was a global development, and the dinosaurs dont rise to ecological dominance in the tropics until after the End Triassic extinction. What we can say is that this shows that the changing environment 215 million years ago was right for their evolutionary diversification, but of course oxygen levels may not have been the only factor. Chindesaurus was an upright carnivorous dinosaur, around 6.6 feet 2 m long and nearly 3.3 feet 1 m high. Found extensively in North America, with origins in the North American tropics, it was a characteristic Late Triassic dinosaur of the American Southwest. The first dinosaurs were quite small, but higher oxygen levels in the atmosphere are often associated with a trend to larger size, said University of Bristols Professor Mike Benton, who was not involved in this research. This new result is interesting as the timing of oxygen rise and dinosaur appearance is good, although dinosaurs had become abundant in South America rather earlier, about 232 million years ago.

Stegosaurs were a widespread group with species of the armored thyreophoran dinosaurs found in Southern Africa, North America, Asia and Europe. But the newly discovered stegosaur, named Adratiklit boulahfa, is the first of the group to hail from North Africa. Its fossilized remains  a handful of vertebrae and an upper arm bone  were found in the Middle Atlas Mountains of Morocco. The discovery of Adratiklit boulahfa is particularly exciting as we have dated it to the middle Jurassic, said Dr. Susannah Maidment, a researcher at the Natural History Museum, London. Most known stegosaurs date from far later in the Jurassic period, making this the oldest definite stegosaur described and helping to increase our understanding of the evolution of this group of dinosaurs. To understand the evolutionary relationship of Adratiklit boulahfa with known stegosaurs, Dr. Maidment and her colleagues from the University of Brighton, the Natural History Museum, London, and the Universit\u00e9 Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah conducted the phylogenetic analysis of the specimens. Despite being from the African continent our phylogenetic analysis indicated that, surprisingly, Adratiklit boulahfa is more closely related to European stegosaurs than it is to the two genera known from southern Africa, said Tom Raven, a PhD student at the University of Brighton and the Natural History Museum, London. When stegosaurs were alive, the world was divided into two supercontinents Laurasia and Gondwana. Laurasia included the land masses that today make up most of the northern hemispheres continents, and Gondwana eventually split into land masses including Africa, South America, Australia and Antarctica. Stegosaurs were diverse and abundant in Laurasia. In contrast, their remains are extremely rare in Gondwana. The discovery of Adratiklit boulahfa now adds to the theory that the Gondwanan fossil record of armored dinosaurs is significantly biased by both geological factors and collection efforts. Most stegosaurs we know of have been found in Laurasian rock formations, Dr. Maidment said. This, however may not mean that stegosaurs were not so common in Gondwana and in fact may be due to the fact that Gondwana rock formations have been subject to far fewer excavations and detailed studies. The teams paper was published in the journal Gondwana Research.

Named Crossvallia waiparensis, the ancient penguin was about 5.2 feet 1.6 m tall  taller than todays 4 foot 1.2 m Emperor penguin  and had a mass of between 70 and 80 kg. Its leg bones and two ends of the humerus were unearthed by amateur paleontologist Leigh Love at the Waipara Greensand fossil site in 2018. Dr. Gerald Mayr from the Senckenberg Natural History Museum and colleagues analyzed the bones and concluded they belonged to a previously unknown penguin species. They concluded that the birds closest known relative is a fellow Paleocene species Crossvallia unienwillia, which was identified from a fossilized partial skeleton found in the Cross Valley in Antarctica in 2000. Finding closely related birds in New Zealand and Antarctica shows our close connection to the icy continent, said Dr. Dr Paul Scofield, a paleontologist at Canterbury Museum. When the Crossvallia species were alive, New Zealand and Antarctica were very different from today  Antarctica was covered in forest and both had much warmer climates.  The leg bones of both Crossvallia penguins suggest their feet played a greater role in swimming than those of modern penguins, or that they hadnt yet adapted to standing upright like modern penguins. Crossvallia waiparensis is the fifth ancient penguin species described from fossils uncovered at the Waipara Greensand site. The Waipara Greensand is arguably the worlds most significant site for penguin fossils from the Paleocene epoch, Dr. Mayr said. The fossils discovered there have made our understanding of penguin evolution a whole lot clearer. Theres more to come, too  more fossils which we think represent new species are still awaiting description. The discovery of a second giant penguin from the Paleocene epoch is further evidence that early penguins were huge, said Dr. Vanesa De Pietri, also from Canterbury Museum. It further reinforces our theory that penguins attained a giant size very early in their evolution. The teams paper was published in the Alcheringa an Australasian Journal of Palaeontology.

The Xinhang forest covered an area of at least 62 acres 250,000 m2 and grew in a coastal environment prone to flooding. Lycopsid trees found in the forest resembled palm trees, with branchless trunks and leafy crowns. Named Guangdedendron, they had no flowers and no seeds, but shed megaspores. These trees were normally less than 10.5 feet 3.2 m tall, but the tallest was estimated at 25.3 feet 7.7 m, taller than the average giraffe. The large density as well as the small size of the trees could make the Xinhang forest very similar to a sugarcane field, although the plants in the forest are distributed in patches, said Professor Deming Wang, a researcher in the School of Earth and Space Sciences at Peking University. It might also be that the Xinhang lycopsid forest was much like the mangroves along the coast, since they occur in a similar environment and play comparable ecologic roles. Several other Devonian fossil forests have been found in the United States and in Norway. The fossilized Guangdedendron trees are visible in the walls of the Jianchuan and Yongchuan clay quarries, below and above a 13 foot 4 m thick sandstone bed, the paleontologists said. Some fossils included pinecone like structures with megaspores, and the diameters of fossilized trunks were used to estimate the trees heights. It was difficult to mark and count all the trees without missing anything. The teams paper was published in the journal Current Biology.

Named Heracles inexpectatus, the giant parrot lived in New Zealand about 19 million years ago Miocene epoch. The bird was about 3.3 feet 1 m tall and had an estimated mass of about 7 kg. Like the kakapo, it was a member of an ancient New Zealand group of parrots that appear to be more primitive than parrots that thrive today on Australia and other continents. New Zealand is well known for its giant birds, said Dr. Trevor Worthy, a paleontologist Flinders University. Not only moa dominated avifaunas, but giant geese and adzebills shared the forest floor, while a giant eagle ruled the skies. But until now, no one has ever found an extinct giant parrot  anywhere. The fossilized bones of Heracles inexpectatus were found near St Bathans in Central Otago, New Zealand, in an area well known for a rich assemblage of Miocene birds. Heracles inexpectatus, as the largest parrot ever, no doubt with a massive parrot beak that could crack wide open anything it fancied, may well have dined on more than conventional parrot foods, perhaps even other parrots, said University of New South Wales Professor Mike Archer. Its rarity in the deposit is something we might expect if it was feeding higher up in the food chain. Parrots in general are very resourceful birds in terms of culinary interests. New Zealand keas, for example, have even developed a taste for sheep since these were introduced by European settlers in 1773. Heracles inexpectatus lived in a diverse subtropical forest where many species of laurels and palms grew with podocarp trees. Undoubtedly, these provided a rich harvest of fruit important in the diet of Heracles inexpectatus and the parrots and pigeons it lived with. But on the forest floor the giant bird competed with adzebills and the forerunners of moa, said Professor Suzanne Hand, also from the University of New South Wales. The St Bathans fauna provides the only insight into the terrestrial birds and other animals that lived in New Zealand since dinosaurs roamed the land more than 66 million years ago, added Dr. Paul Scofield, senior curator at Canterbury Museum, Christchurch.

The newly identified dinosaur species, named Ngwevu intloko, lived between 191 and 201 million years ago Early Jurassic epoch in what is now South Africa. The ancient creature was bipedal with a fairly chunky body, a long slender neck and a small, boxy head. It would have measured 10 feet 3 m from the tip of its snout to the end of its tail and was likely an omnivore, feeding on both plants and small animals. Ngwevu intlokos fossilized remains were collected in 1978 by paleontologist Professor James W. Kitching. Professor Paul Barrett and colleagues reassessed the specimens, which are held at the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. They used the dinosaurs distinctive skull and partial skeleton to identify it as a new genus and species of sauropodomorph. Lots of other scientists have already looked at it. But they all thought that it was simply an odd example of Massospondylus, one of the first dinosaurs to reign at the start of the Jurassic period, Professor Barrett said. The findings will help paleontologists better understand the transition between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, around 200 million years ago. Known as a time of mass extinction it now seems that more complex ecosystems were flourishing in the earliest Jurassic than previously thought. This new species is interesting, because we thought previously that there was really only one type of sauropodomorph living in South Africa at this time, Professor Barrett said. We now know there were actually six or seven of these dinosaurs in this area, as well as variety of other dinosaurs from less common groups. It means that their ecology was much more complex than we used to think. Some of these other sauropodomorphs were like Massospondylus, but a few were close to the origins of true sauropods, if not true sauropods themselves.

"}, {"title": " Study: Dinosaur Feathers Evolved for Sexual Display", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Aug 5, 2019", "doc": "New research, published recently in the journal Evolution, shows that some dinosaurs may have taken flight thanks to sex appeal. Modern bird feathers are complicated the feathers on a birds wing each have a central hollow shafted called a rachis, branching filaments called barbs, and even smaller filaments called barbules. Fossil feathers show us that many dinosaurs were covered only in simple hair like feathers. Those simple hairy feathers served as insulation and had absolutely nothing to do with flight. But it has been unclear how simple feathers later developed into complicated feathers on wings. The first complex wing feathers show up in tiny raptor dinosaurs that could parachute and glide flying squirrel style through the prehistoric tree tops, said study lead author Dr. Scott Persons, a researcher at the Mace Brown Museum of Natural History. We explored how dinosaurs went from staying warm with simple hairy feathers to gliding on complicated wing feathers. Dr. Persons and University of Albertas Professor Philip Currie found that larger, stiffer, flatter feathers gradually evolved as showy fans on the arms and tails of dinosaurs to be waved and waggled in courtship displays, leading eventually to the evolution of birds. The evolution of avian flight is one of the most important transitions in vertebrate evolution, Dr. Persons said. There are now over 10,000 species of birds, and birds were the only group of dinosaurs to survive the mass extinction. The extraordinary success of birds is tied to their ability to fly. But, to evolve into complex flight feathers, traditional natural selection needed a boost from sexual selection. Effectively, sexual selection led to an increased complexity, which bridged the gap from one function to another. Recognizing that critical contribution teaches us something fundamental and important about the evolutionary process. The implications go way beyond the single example of dinosaurs and feather evolution. While the study sheds new light on the evolutionary steps leading from dinosaurs to birds, there are still rich paleontological mysteries to explore concerning fossil feathers. We are still missing clear examples of sexually dimorphic feathers in dinosaurs. Today, its easy to tell the sexes of many birds apart based on their feathers, Dr. Persons explained. Male birds tend to have larger, gaudier, and brighter feathers because they are the ones doing the displaying, he said. This was very likely true of feathered dinosaurs, but we havent found a definitive example yet.

Named Cambroraster falcatus, the ancient creature was up to one foot 30 cm in length. Its size would have been even more impressive at the time it was alive, as most animals living during the Cambrian Period were smaller than your little finger, said Joe Moysiuk, a graduate student at the University of Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum. Cambroraster falcatus was a distant cousin of\u00a0Anomalocaris, the top predator living in the seas at that time, but it seems to have been feeding in a radically different way. The animal had a large horseshoe shaped head carapace, rake like claws and a pineapple slice shaped mouth. We think Cambroraster falcatus may have used these claws to sift through sediment, trapping buried prey in the net like array of hooked spines, said Dr. Jean Bernard Caron, also from the University of Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum. With the interspace between the spines on the claws at typically less than a millimeter, this would have enabled the animal to feed on very small organisms, although larger prey could also likely be captured, and ingested into the circular tooth lined mouth. This specialized mouth apparatus is the namesake of the extinct group Radiodonta, which includes both Cambroraster falcatus and Anomalocaris and is considered to be one of the earliest offshoots of the arthropod lineage.  With its broad head carapace with deep notches accommodating the upward facing eyes, Cambroraster falcatus resembles modern living bottom dwelling animals like horseshoe crabs, Moysiuk said. This represents a remarkable case of evolutionary convergence in these radiodonts. Such convergence is likely reflective of a similar environment and mode of life  like modern horseshoe crabs, Cambroraster falcatus may have used its carapace to plough through sediment as it fed. Perhaps even more astonishing is the large number of specimens recovered. The sheer abundance of this animal is extraordinary, Dr. Caron said. Based on over a hundred exceptionally well preserved fossils, the team was able to reconstruct Cambroraster falcatus in unprecedented detail, revealing characteristics that had not been seen before in related species. The radiodont fossil record is very sparse typically, we only find scattered bits and pieces. The large number of parts and unusually complete fossils preserved at the same place are a real coup, as they help us to better understand what these animals looked like and how they lived, Dr. Caron said. We are really excited about this discovery. Cambroraster falcatus clearly illustrates that predation was a big deal at that time with many kinds of surprising morphological adaptations. A paper describing Cambroraster falcatus was published online this week in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Microdocodon gracilis was a docodont, from an extinct lineage of near relatives of mammals from the Mesozoic Era called mammaliaforms. The ancient animal had a skull length of 34 inch 2 cm, a head body length about 2 inches 6 cm, and a long tail about 3 inches 8 cm in length. It likely weighed between 5 grams to 9 gram less than 13 of an ounce. The slender and gracile skeletal elements of Microdocodon gracilis suggest that it was an agile and active animal living on the tree. Its teeth were for insectivorous diet. The creature co existed with other docodonts like the semiaquatic Castorocauda, the subterranean Docofossor, the tree dwelling Agilodocodon, as well as some mammaliaform gliders. Its fossilized remains with delicate hyoid bones were found at the famous Jurassic Daohugou site near the Wuhua village in Inner Mongolia, China. It is a pristine, beautiful fossil. I was amazed by the exquisite preservation of this tiny fossil at the first sight, said University of Chicagos Professor Zhe Xi Luo, senior author of the study. We got a sense that it was unusual, but we were puzzled about what was unusual about it. After taking detailed photographs and examining the fossil under a microscope, it dawned on us that this Jurassic animal has tiny hyoid bones much like those of modern mammals. Mammalian hyoid apparatus is mobile and allows the throat muscles to control the intricate functions to transport and swallow chewed food or drink fluids. Other vertebrates also have hyoid bones, but their hyoids are simple and rod like, without mobile joints between segments. They can only swallow food whole or in large chunks. When and how this unique hyoid structure first appeared in mammals, however, has long been in question among paleontologists. Now we are able for the first time to address how the crucial function for swallowing evolved among early mammals from the fossil record, Professor Luo said. The tiny hyoids of Microdocodon gracilis are a big milestone for interpreting the evolution of mammalian feeding function. The findings appear in the journal Science.

We were looking for the shells of single celled organisms known as benthic foraminifera, when we noticed the translucent glassy balls, smaller than grains of salt, Dr. Meyer explained. They really stood out. Sand grains are kind of lumpy, potato shaped things. But I kept finding these tiny, perfect spheres. The scientists analyzed the elemental makeup and physical features of the spheres and compared them to other microtektites, volcanic rock and byproducts of industrial processes, such as coal ash. According to the team, these microtektites are between 2 and 3 million years old. They are likely the remnants of one or more undocumented meteor impacts on or near the Florida Platform, the plateau that undergirds the Florida Peninsula. Initial results from an unpublished test suggest the spheres have traces of exotic metals, further evidence they are microtektites, said Dr. Meyer, lead author of a paper published in the journal Meteoritics  Planetary Science. One oddity is that they contain high amounts of sodium, a feature that sets them apart from other impact debris. Salt is highly volatile and generally boils off if thrust into the atmosphere at high speed. This high sodium content is intriguing because it suggests a very close location for the impact. Or at the very least, whatever impact created it likely hit a very large reserve of rock salt or the ocean. A lot of those indicators point to something close to Florida. The researchers suspect there are far more microtektites awaiting discovery in Florida and asked amateur fossil collectors to keep an eye out for the tiny spheres.

Hesperornithoides miessleri roamed our planet approximately 150 million years ago Jurassic period. Nicknamed Lori, the ancient creature was about the size of a chicken and lived in a world populated by giant dinosaurs such as Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, and Allosaurus. The partial, well preserved skull and postcranial skeleton of Hesperornithoides miessleri were found in 2001 at the Jimbo Quarry in the Morrison Formation near Douglas, Wyoming. I remember the first time I laid my eyes on this little dinosaur. Even back then, I knew it was a significant discovery, said team member Dean Lomax, a paleontologist and visiting scientist at the University of Manchester. But, it wasnt until 2015 when our dino team formed and we began to study Lori in much more detail than ever before. One of the other key findings of the study relates to the origin of bird flight. Hesperornithoides miessleri is a highly terrestrial proto bird, suggesting that many features scientists associate with being bird like evolved in dinosaurs that lived out their lives on the ground. We found that Lori is a primitive member of a group of dinosaurs that includes Troodon, but perhaps more importantly we discovered that the smaller details of the family tree of bird like dinosaurs isnt quite as resolved as some researchers would claim, said team leader Scott Hartman, a PhD candidate at the University of Wisconsin Madison. For example, it only takes a few changes in the dataset for Hesperornithoides miessleri to be found as a closer relative of Velociraptor than of Troodon. One robust finding we did come up with is that even as the interrelationships changed, the primitive members of all these groups were non flying ground dwelling dinosaurs. That means that some small relatives of Velociraptor such as Microraptor that looks like it could have glided evolved this separately from the modern bird family. The discovery is detailed in a paper published this month in the journal PeerJ.

Aquilarhinus palimentus belongs to the Hadrosauridae duck billed dinosaurs, a group of plant eating ornithopod dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period. The fossilized remains of the dinosaur were collected in the 1980 90s from the Aguja Formation in south western Texas. They were analyzed by paleontologists from Texas Tech University and the Institut Catal\u00e0 de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont, Barcelona, Spain. Hadrosaurids were the most common herbivorous dinosaurs at the end of the Mesozoic Era, and all had a similar looking snout, the researchers said. The front of the jaws meet in a U shape to support a cupped beak used for cropping plants. The beak of some species is broader than in others, but there was no evidence of a significantly different shape and therefore likely also different feeding style in duckbills until Aquilarhinus palimentus was discovered. The lower jaws of Aquilarhinus palimentus meet in a peculiar W shape, creating a wide, flattened scoop. This new animal is one of the more primitive hadrosaurids known and can therefore help us to understand how and why the ornamentation on their heads evolved, as well as where the group initially evolved and migrated from, said Dr. Albert Prieto M\u00e1rquez, a paleontologist in the Institut Catal\u00e0 de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont. Its existence adds another piece of evidence to the growing hypothesis, still up in the air, that the group began in the southeastern area of the United States.

Elektorornis chenguangi belongs to a group of extinct birds called Enantiornithes, the most abundant type of bird known from the Mesozoic era. The bird was smaller than a sparrow, and it was arboreal, meaning it spent most of its time in trees as opposed to on the ground or in water. I was very surprised when I saw the amber, said Dr. Lida Xing, a paleontologist at the China University of Geosciences. It shows that ancient birds were way more diverse than we thought. They had evolved many different features to adapt to their environments. The fossil that Dr. Xing and colleagues examined is an incomplete right hindlimb with feathers preserved encased in amber, measuring 3.48 x 3.44 x 0.82 cm and weighing 5.51 g. It was found in 2014 at the Angbamo locality in the Hukawng Valley of Myanmar. The researchers scanned the specimen with micro CT and created a 3D reconstruction of the foot. They found that the birds third toe, measuring 9.8 mm, is 41 longer than its second toe and 20 longer than its tarsometatarsus a bone in the lower legs of birds. They also compared the ratios with those of 20 other extinct birds from the same era and 62 living birds. No bird has a foot that resembles this one. Elongated toes are something you commonly see in arboreal animals because they need to be able to grip these branches and wrap their toes around them, said Dr. Jingmai OConnor, a scientist in the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. But this extreme difference in toe lengths, as far as we know, has never been seen before. It remains unknown why Elektorornis chenguangi evolved such an unusual feature. The only known animal with disproportionally long digits is the aye aye Daubentonia madagascariensis, a lemur that uses its long middle fingers to fish larvae and insects out of tree trunks for food. Elektorornis chenguangi might have used its toe for the same purpose. This is the best guess we have. There is no bird with a similar morphology that could be considered a modern analog for this fossil bird, Dr. OConnor said. A lot of ancient birds were probably doing completely different things than living birds. This fossil exposes a different ecological niche that these early birds were experimenting as they evolved. The discovery is reported in a paper in the journal Current Biology.

The unique Microraptor specimen was collected in deposits of the Jiufotang Formation near Jianchang in Liaoning Province, northeastern China, and was acquired by paleontologists in 2005. Both the dinosaur and the lizard were part of the so called Jehol Biota, an early Cretaceous terrestrial and freshwater ecosystem preserved in a multi layered rock formation cropping out in the Chinese provinces of Liaoning, Hebei and Inner Mongolia and famous for exceptionally preserved remnants of early birds, feathered dinosaurs, primitive mammals and ancient plants. This is the fourth documented occurrence of a Microraptor preserving stomach contents, said Professor Jingmai OConnor from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and colleagues. This dinosaur is now known to have fed on mammals, birds, fish, and lizards, supporting the interpretation that it was an opportunistic predator. Named Indrasaurus wangi, the lizard had teeth unlike any other previously known from the Jehol Biota. The creatures skeleton is nearly complete and articulated, showing that it was swallowed whole and head first, meaning that Microraptor fed in a manner similar to living carnivorous birds and lizards. Recently, one specimen of the Jurassic four winged bird like dinosaur Anchiornis was described with bones belonging to more than one unidentified lizard preserved in the esophagus, interpreted as a gastric pellet prior to egestion, the paleontologists said. Our data indicate that both Anchiornis and Microraptor had similar, unspecialized diets consistent with their overall similar skull architecture and skeletal proportions both species are documented feeding on lizards and fish and are considered opportunistic predators. The discovery is described in a paper in the journal Current Biology.

A team of paleontologists has examined the tooth mineralization processes in mackerel sharks and discovered a unique feature in their teeth, which allowed the researchers to trace back the origin of the group to Palaeocarcharias stromeri, a small benthic shark from the Middle Jurassic epoch, some 165 million years ago. Similar to humans, shark teeth are composed of two mineralized structures a hard shell of hypermineralized tissue in humans enamel, in sharks enameloid and a dentin core, said Dr. Patrick Jambura from the University of Vienna and colleagues. Depending on the structure of the dentin we distinguish between two different types orthodentin and osteodentin. Orthodentin has a very compact appearance and is similar to the dentin we can find in human teeth. In shark teeth, orthodentin is confined to the tooth crown. In contrast, the other dentin type is spongious in appearance and resembles real bone and therefore is called osteodentin. It can be found in the root, anchoring the tooth to the jaw and in some species also in the tooth crown where it supports the orthodentin. Using high resolution micro CT images, the scientists examined the tooth composition of the great white shark and its relatives. They found a peculiar condition of the teeth of members of this group the osteodentin of the roots intrudes into the crown and replaces the orthodentin there completely, making it the only type of dentin being present. This condition is not known from any other shark, which all possess orthodentin to some degree and thus it is confined to members of this group. The researchers also examined a fossil shark called Palaeocarcharias stromeri. The oldest known specimen of this species is from the Middle Jurassic and it didnt have much in common with living mackerel sharks. Palaeocarcharias stromeri is a small sluggish benthic shark, not exceeding lengths of more than 3.3 feet 1 m and seemingly hunted small fish in shallow waters. To this day, its affiliation has been a riddle to paleontologists, since its body shape resembles a carpet shark, while its fang like teeth are similar to mackerel sharks. The examination of the tooth microstructure yielded the presence of the same unique tooth composition that is found only in great white sharks and their relatives. The shared tooth histology is a strong indicator that this small inconspicuous shark gave rise to one of the most iconic shark lineages that includes giants like Carcharocles megalodon or the living great white shark. Orthodentin is known for almost all vertebrates  from fish to mammals, including all modern sharks, except for the mackerel sharks, Dr. Jambura said. The discovery of this unique tooth structure in Palaeocarcharias stromeri strongly indicates that we found the oldest known ancestor of the great white shark and shows that even this charismatic giant shark started on a shoestring. The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The most interesting thing we discovered was how frequently it seems extinct crocodyliforms ate plants, said lead author Keegan Melstrom, a doctoral student in the Department of Geology and Geophysics and the Natural History Museum of Utah at the University of Utah. Our study indicates that complexly shaped teeth, which we infer to indicate herbivory, appear in the extinct relatives of crocodiles at least three times and maybe as many as six. All living crocodylians possess a similar general body shape and ecology to match their lifestyle as semiaquatic generalist carnivores, which includes relatively simple, conical teeth. Extinct crocodyliforms showed a different pattern, including species with many specializations not seen today. One such specialization is a feature known as heterodonty regionalized differences in tooth size or shape. Carnivores possess simple teeth whereas herbivores have much more complex teeth. Omnivores fall somewhere in between, Melstrom said. Part of my earlier research showed that this pattern holds in living reptiles that have teeth, such as crocodylians and lizards. So these results told us that the basic pattern between diet and teeth is found in both mammals and reptiles, despite very different tooth shapes, and is applicable to extinct reptiles. To infer what those extinct crocodyliforms most likely ate, Melstrom and his colleague, University of Utahs Dr. Randall Irmis, compared the tooth complexity of extinct crocodyliforms to those of living animals using a method originally developed for use in living mammals. Overall, the researchers measured 146 teeth from 16 different species of extinct crocodyliforms. Using a combination of quantitative dental measurements and other morphological features, they reconstructed the diets of those extinct crocodyliforms. The results show that those animals had a wider range of dental complexities and presumed dietary ecologies than had been appreciated previously. Plant eating crocodyliforms appeared early in the evolutionary history of the group, shortly after the end Triassic mass extinction, and persisted until the end Cretaceous mass extinction that killed off all dinosaurs except birds, the scientists said. Our analysis suggests that herbivory arose independently a minimum of three times, and possibly six times, in Mesozoic crocodyliforms. The research appears in the journal Current Biology.

Named Pachystruthio dmanisensis, the ancient bird was at least 11.5 feet 3.5 m tall and had an estimated body mass of about 450 kg. These values make it one of the largest known birds  comparable to the elephant bird Aepyornis maximus  and the only bird of such giant size in Europe and the Northern Hemisphere in general. In contrast to very large birds from Madagascar, New Zealand and Australia, Pachystruthio dmanisensis was a good runner, which may be explained by its co existence with large carnivorous mammals. Its femur is comparable to modern ostriches as well as smaller species of moa and terror birds. Speed may have been essential to the birds survival, said Dr. Nikita Zelenkov from the Borissiak Paleontological Institute and colleagues. Alongside its bones, we found fossils of highly specialized, massive carnivores from the Ice Age. They included giant cheetah, giant hyenas and saber toothed cats, which were able to prey on mammoths. The nearly complete left femur of Pachystruthio dmanisensis came from the recently discovered Taurida karst cave in the Belogorsk region, the Crimean Peninsula. When I first felt the weight of the bird whose thigh bone I was holding in my hand, I thought it must be a Malagasy elephant bird fossil because no birds of this size have ever been reported from Europe. However, the structure of the bone unexpectedly told a different story, Dr. Zelenkov said. We dont have enough data yet to say whether it was most closely related to ostriches or to other birds, but we estimate it weighed about 450 kg. This formidable weight is nearly double the largest moa, three times the largest living bird, the common ostrich, and nearly as much as an adult polar bear. The paleontologists also found the remains of Pachystruthio dmanisensis and a similar range of fossil mammals at the site of Dmanisi in Georgia. Pachystruthio dmanisensis was likely a typical component of eastern European faunas at the time of early hominin arrival, they said. We suggest that this giant bird, together with early Homo and a variety of mammals, reached the northern Black Sea region via the southern Caucasus and Anatolia, because the older Pliocene finds of this fauna are known from Georgia and Turkey.

A pigment called melanin gives black, reddish brown and gray colors to birds and is involved in creating bright iridescent sheens in bird feathers. This can be observed by studying the melanin packages called melanosomes, which are shaped like little cylindrical objects less than one thousandth of a millimeter and vary in shape from sausage shapes to little meatballs. However, besides iridescent colors, which is structural, birds also make non iridescent structural colors. Those are, for example, blue color tones in parrots and kingfishers. Until now, it was not known if such colors could be discovered in fossils. Paleontologists have shown that the feather itself, which is made of keratin, does not fossilize while the melanin does. Therefore, if a blue feather fossilized, the dark pigment may be the only surviving feature and the feather may be interpreted as black or brown. Now Dr. Frane Barbarovic from the University of Bristol and the University of Sheffield and colleagues have shown that blue feather melanosomes are distinct from melanosomes that are from feathers expressing black, reddish brown, brown and iridescent, but overlap significantly with some gray feather melanosomes. By looking at plumage colorations of modern representatives of fossil specimen and reconstructing which color was the most likely present in the fossil specimen, the researchers were able to discriminate between melanosomes significant for gray and blue color, leading to the reconstruction of an ancient bird species called Eocoracias brachyptera as a predominantly blue bird. We have discovered that melanosomes in blue feathers have a distinct range in size from most of color categories and we can, therefore, constrain which fossils may have been blue originally, Dr. Barbarovic said. The overlap with gray color may suggest some common mechanism in how melanosomes are involved in making gray coloration and how these structural blue colors are formed. The research was published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.

They didnt find the proteins or DNA, but they did find unusual communities of modern microbes living inside the dinosaur bones. This is breaking new ground  this is the first time weve discovered this unique microbial community in these fossil bones while theyre buried underground, said study lead author Dr. Evan Saitta, a researcher at the Field Museum of Natural History. During the fossilization process, biological tissues degrade over millions of years, with some types of molecules breaking down faster than others. However, traces of biological material have been found inside some fossils. While some researchers believe these could be the remains of ancient proteins, blood vessels, and cells, traditionally thought to be among the least stable components of bone, others think that they have more recent sources. To investigate the source of the biological material in dinosaur bones, Dr. Saitta and colleagues performed a range of analyses on the 75 million year old fossilized bones of Centrosaurus. The bones were carefully excavated in a manner to reduce contamination. The scientists compared the biochemical makeup of the fossils with modern chicken bones, sediment from the fossil site in Alberta, Canada, and ancient shark teeth. They found that the Centrosaurus fossils didnt seem to contain the collagen proteins present in fresh bones or the much younger shark teeth. But we see lots of evidence of recent microbes. Theres clearly something organic in these bones, Dr. Saitta said. We found non radiocarbon dead organic carbon, recent amino acids, and DNA in the bone  thats indicative that the bone is hosting a modern microbial community and providing refuge. Surprisingly, these microbes arent quite the same run of the mill bacteria living in the surrounding rock. Its a very unusual community. About 30 of the sequences are related to Euzebya, which is only reported from places like Etruscan tombs and the skin of sea cucumbers, as far as I know, Dr. Saitta said. We arent sure why these particular microbes are living in the dinosaur bones, but were not shocked that bacteria are drawn to the fossils. Fossil bones contain phosphorus and iron, and microbes need those as nutrients. And the bones are porous  they wick up moisture. If you were a bacterium living in the ground, youd probably want to live in a dinosaur bone.

The newly described fossil teeth of Chasmaporthetes hyenas are most likely between about 1.4 million and 850,000 years old, with ages more likely closer to the older figure. Fossils of this genus had been found in Africa, Europe and Asia, and also in the southern United States, said Dr. Jack Tseng, a paleontologist at the University at Buffalo. But where and how did these animals get to North America? The teeth we studied, even though they were just two teeth, start to answer those questions. Ancient hyenas likely entered North America via Beringia, an area, including Alaska and Yukon Territory, that connects Asia with North America during periods of low sea levels. From there, the animals made their way south all the way to Mexico. The newly described teeth are important in part because they provide the first proof of ancient hyenas living in Beringia. It is amazing to imagine hyenas thriving in the harsh conditions above the Arctic Circle during the Ice Age, said Dr. Grant Zazula, a paleontologist with the Canadian Museum of Nature. Chasmaporthetes probably hunted herds of ice age caribou and horses or scavenged carcasses of mammoths on the vast steppe tundra that stretched from Siberia to Yukon Territory. Our previous understanding of where these far ranging hyenas lived was based on fossil records in southern North America on one hand, and Asia, Europe and Africa on the other, Dr. Tseng said. These rare records of hyenas in the Arctic fill in a massive gap in a location where we expected evidence of their crossing between continents, but had no proof until now. Hyenas disappeared from North America before the first people arrived. Although the reasons for this extinction between one million and 500,000 years ago remain unclear, it is possible that the animals bone crushing, scavenging niche was replaced by the impressive short faced bear Arctodus simus.

Their work appears in the journal Nature. Scattered throughout the history of evolution are major transitions, including the leap from a world of microscopic single cells to a world of multi celled animals, said University of Queenslands Professor Bernie Degnan, co lead author of the study. The great great great grandmother of all cells in the animal kingdom, so to speak, was probably quite similar to a stem cell. Its one of those things that has always been in the textbooks, and people have always assumed, but no one has ever really tested. Its important to test the traditional hypothesis, said co author Dr. Kevin Kocot, a researcher at the University of Alabama and curator of invertebrate zoology in the Alabama Museum of Natural History. The closest relative to animals are single celled organisms called choanoflagellates that look like microscopic tadpoles swimming in the ocean but lack many defining traits of animals. They look a lot like a type of cell in a sponge, the most ancient lineage of all animals. It was thought the similarities between choanoflagellates and these sponge cells, choanocytes, meant they evolved from a common ancestor with this appearance. In the study, the researchers looked at the genes active in the choanoflagellates, different types of sponge cells and other single celled organisms. Unexpectedly, they found choanoflagellates and the sponges choanocyte cells are not alike. In fact, they are the least alike of all the sponges cells. Instead, they found choanoflagellates had the most in common with sponge cells called archeocytes, which function similarly to stem cells in more complex animals. The first animal cells, then, were able to transition between multiple states, forming a more complex multicellular animal than previously thought. The first multicellular ancestor of animals werent just a simple ball of cells, Dr. Kocot said. They probably had complex cells with lots of genetic diversity that were able to differentiate into other cell types. Were taking a core theory of evolutionary biology and turning it on its head, said co lead author Sandie Degnan, a biologist at the University of Queensland. Now we have an opportunity to re imagine the steps that gave rise to the first animals, the underlying rules that turned single cells into multicellular animal life.

Trilobites are a group of extinct marine arthropods that resemble modern day horseshoe crabs and are related to modern crustaceans and insects. These creatures appeared in ancient oceans in the Early Cambrian period, about 540 million years ago, and disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the Permian period, about 252 million years ago. They were extremely diverse, with about 20,000 species, and their fossil exoskeletons can be found all around the world. Dubbed Redlichia rex, the newly discovered species is the largest Cambrian trilobite discovered in Australia. It grew to around 12 inches 30 cm in length, which is almost twice the size of other Australian trilobites of similar age. We decided to name this new species of trilobite Redlichia rex  similar to Tyrannosaurus rex  because of its giant size, as well as its formidable legs with spines used for crushing and shredding food, which may have been other trilobites, said James Holmes, a PhD student with the University of Adelaide. The preservation of soft parts  such as the antennae and legs  in fossilized trilobites is extremely rare. Redlichia rex was discovered at the Emu Bay Shale on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, a world renowned deposit famous for this type of preservation. Interestingly, trilobite specimens from the Emu Bay Shale  including Redlichia rex  exhibit injuries that were caused by shell crushing predators, said Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Bellido, a researcher at the University of Adelaide and the South Australian Museum. There are also large specimens of fossilized coprolites containing trilobite fragments in this fossil deposit. The large size of injured Redlichia rex specimens and the associated coprolites suggests that either much bigger predators were targeting Redlichia rex, such as Anomalocaris, an even larger shrimp like creature, or that the new species had cannibalistic tendencies. One of the major drivers of the Cambrian explosion was likely an evolutionary arms race between predators and prey, with each developing more effective measures of defense and attack. The overall size and crushing legs of Redlichia rex are a likely consequence of the arms race that occurred at this time. This giant trilobite was likely the terror of smaller creatures on the Cambrian seafloor, Holmes said. The discovery is described in a paper published online this week in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology.

Previously, they were thought to only be able to take to the air once they had grown to almost full size, just like birds or bats. This assumption was based on fossilized pterosaur embryos found in China that had poorly developed wings. However, a team of paleontologists from Universities of Leicester and Lincoln was able to disprove this hypothesis. University of Leicesters Dr. David Unwin and Dr. Charles Deeming from the University of Lincoln compared fossilized eggs and embryos of a pterosaur species called Hamipterus tianshanensis with data on prenatal growth in birds and crocodiles, finding that they were still at an early stage of development and a long way from hatching. Theoretically what pterosaurs did, growing and flying, is impossible, but they didnt know this, so they did it anyway, Dr. Unwin said. Another fundamental difference between baby pterosaurs, also known as flaplings, and baby birds or bats, is that they had no parental care and had to feed and look after themselves from birth. Their ability to fly gave them a lifesaving survival mechanism which they used to evade carnivorous dinosaurs. This ability also proved to be one of their biggest killers, as the demanding and dangerous process of flight led to many of them dying at a very early age. Since flaplings were able to both fly and grow from birth, this provides a possible explanation as to why they were able to reach enormous wingspans, far larger than any historic or current species of bird or bat. How they were able to carry out this process will require further research, but it is a question that wouldnt have been posed without these recent developments in our understanding. Our technique shows that pterosaurs were different from birds and bats and so comparative anatomy can reveal novel developmental modes in extinct species, Dr. Deeming said.

There are about 60 opalized bones from one adult dinosaur, including part of the braincase, and bones from at least another three animals. It is the first dinosaur herd to be discovered in Australia. Fostoria dhimbangunmal has given us the most complete opalized dinosaur skeleton in the world, said Dr. Jenni Brammall, a paleontologist and special projects officer of the Australian Opal Centre. Partial skeletons of extinct swimming reptiles have been found at other Australian opal fields, but for opalized dinosaurs we generally have only a single bone or tooth or in rare instances, a few bones. To recover dozens of bones from the one skeleton is a first.

They went extinct along with dozens of other megafaunal species at the end of the last Ice Age, approximately 10,000 years ago. Now a team of researchers in Canada has uncovered a possible reason of their extinction vanishing food source. More importantly, the scientists have discovered that these enormous rodents did not eat wood  a distinct divergence from their dentally endowed descendants. Tessa Plint of Heriot Watt University and her colleagues from the University of Western Ontario, Yukon Palaeontology Program and the Canadian Museum of Nature used stable isotopes of fossil bones and teeth to determine the diet of the now extinct giant beavers. The researchers found that the beavers ate submerged aquatic plants macrophytes. This diet made the rodents, which weighed approximately 100 kg, highly dependent on wetland habitat not only for shelter from predators but also for food. We did not find any evidence that the giant beaver cut down trees or ate trees for food, Plint said. Giant beavers were not ecosystem engineers the way that the North American beaver is. Beavers members of the genus Castor and giant beavers actually co existed for tens of thousands of years in North America during the Pleistocene epoch before the latter went extinct. After the last Ice Age, the ice sheets retreated and the climate became much drier. This climate change was bad news for giant beavers. The ability to build dams and lodges may have actually given beavers a competitive advantage over giant beavers because it could alter the landscape to create suitable wetland habitat where required. Giant beavers couldnt do this, said Professor Fred Longstaffe, from the University of Western Ontario. When you look at the fossil record from the last million years, you repeatedly see regional giant beaver populations disappear with the onset of more arid climatic conditions. The findings were published in the journal Scientific Reports. "}, {"title": " Feathers Arose 80 Million Years before Birds, Scientists Say", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jun 5, 2019", "doc": "According to a new review paper published in the journal Trends in Ecology  Evolution, feathers arose 250 230 million years ago, during the Early Triassic, when life was recovering from the devastating end Permian mass extinction. It is shocking to realize that feathers originated long before birds because feathers have generally been regarded as the key innovation that drove the success of the avian fauna. However, thousands of fossils from China have shown that many non avian dinosaurs also had feathers, including feather types not found in birds today. Those discoveries extended the origin of feathers minimally back to 175 million years ago  about 25 million years before the first generally acknowledged bird, Archaeopteryx. Recent discoveries of feathers in ornithischian dinosaurs hinted that they are a character of dinosaurs as a whole. Another startling discovery showed that even pterosaurs had four kinds of feather, apparently similar in form with those of dinosaurs, their closest relatives. The oldest bird is still Archaeopteryx first found in the Late Jurassic of southern Germany in 1861, although some species from China are a little older, said University of Bristols Professor Mike Benton, lead author of the paper. Those fossils all show a diversity of feathers down feathers over the body and long, vaned feathers on the wings. But, since 1994, paleontologists have been contending with the perturbing discovery, based on hundreds of amazing specimens from China, that many dinosaurs also had feathers. At first, the dinosaurs with feathers were close to the origin of birds in the evolutionary tree, added co author Dr. Baoyu Jiang, a researcher at the University of Nanjing. This was not so hard to believe. So, the origin of feathers was pushed back at least to the origin of those bird like dinosaurs, maybe 200 million years ago. Then, we had the good fortune to work on Kulindadromeus zabaikalicus, a feathered plant eating dinosaur that lived in the lake dotted lowlands of Jurassic Siberia between 169 and 144 million years ago, said co author Dr. Maria McNamara, from University College Cork. This dinosaur showed amazingly well preserved skin covered with scales on the legs and tail, and strange whiskery feathers all over its body. What surprised people was that this was a dinosaur that was as far from birds in the evolutionary tree as could be imagined. Perhaps feathers were present in the very first dinosaurs. Modern birds like chickens often have scales on their legs or necks, and we showed these were reversals what had once been feathers had reversed to be scales, said co author Dr. Danielle Dhouailly, from the University of Grenoble. In fact, we have shown that the same genome regulatory network drives the development of reptile scales, bird feathers, and mammal hairs. Feathers could have evolved very early. The breakthrough came when we were studying two new pterosaurs from China. We saw that many of their whiskers were branched. We expected single strands  monofilaments  but what we saw were tufts and down feathers. Pterosaurs had feathers, Dr. Jiang said. This drives the origin of feathers back to 250 million years ago at least, Professor Benton said. The point of origin of pterosaurs, dinosaurs and their relatives. The Early Triassic world then was recovering from the most devastating mass extinction ever, and life on land had come back from near total wipe out. Paleontologists had already noted that the new reptiles walked upright instead of sprawling, that their bone structure suggested fast growth and maybe even warm bloodedness, and the mammal ancestors probably had hair by then. So, the dinosaurs, pterosaurs and their ancestors had feathers too. Feathers then probably arose to aid this speeding up of physiology and ecology, purely for insulation. The other functions of feathers, for display and of course for flight, came much later.

The limestone shale slab, about 22 inches long by 15 inches wide 57 by 37.5 cm, was collected from the Green River Formation, a fossil site located in western Colorado, eastern Utah and southwestern Wyoming in the United States. It formed approximately 50 million years ago Eocene epoch and contains fossils of 259 fish, most of them heading in similar directions. We identified the species as Erismatopterus levatus based on their dorsal fin rays having two spines with six to seven soft fin rays, the base of their pelvic fin having a subthoracic location, and their anal fin rays having two spines with seven soft fin rays, said Dr. Nobuaki Mizumoto of Arizona State University and his colleagues. Moreover, Erismatopterus levatus is known only from Lake Gosiute and Lake Uinta deposits of the Green River Formation. Lengths of the individuals ranged from about 0.4 to 0.9 inches 1.1 2.4 cm, which is much smaller than the descriptive specimen of this species 2.6 inches, or 6.5 cm, long, indicating that they were juveniles or larvae. The structure of the group shared characteristics with extant fish shoals, the paleontologists said. The group showed an oblong shape longer in the direction of movement. This is the usual shape of extant shoals and is thought to protect against ambush predators by reducing the frontal area, where these predators tend to attack. The fossilized fish group also showed a high level of individual alignment to one another. Fossils with animals preserved while doing something are referred to as frozen behaviors, Dr. Mizumoto and co authors said. Examples include fighting dinosaurs, queuing trilobites and insects in copulation. These fossils are assumed to result from rapid burial, which preserves individual positions during interactions. Our fish shoal was fixed near instantaneously so that individual positions and heading directions were preserved in the fossil. Rapid fixation of the fish shoal might be possible by sand dune collapse on shallow water, which can produce a bed in only seconds or minutes, they added. Sudden freezing caused by supercooling could also explain rapid fixation, although this seems unlikely, given the warm climate estimated for the Eocene Green River Formation. Although it remains unclear how the fish shoals structure was preserved in the fossil, these findings suggest that fishes have been forming shoals by combining sets of simple behavioral rules since at least the Eocene, the researchers concluded. A report on the discovery was published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

The two new species, named Phuwiangvenator yaemniyomi and Vayuraptor nongbualamphuensis, roamed the Earth approximately 125 million years ago Cretaceous period. Their fossilized remains were found in the Sao Khua Formation of Thailand. Both ancient creatures belong to Megaraptora megaraptors, a group of medium  to large sized theropod dinosaurs with a long snout and large claws. The relatives of this group of carnivorous predatory dinosaurs include Tyrannosaurus rex, said Adun Samathi of the Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Universit\u00e4t Bonn and colleagues. Like T. rex, they ran on their hind legs. Unlike the tyrant lizard, however, their arms were strong and armed with long claws. They also had more delicate heads that ended in a long snout. Phuwiangvenator yaemniyomi was likely a fast runner. At about 20 feet 6 m long, this dinosaur was considerably smaller than T. rex approximately 40 feet, or 12 m, in length. Vayuraptor nongbualamphuenisis measured approximately 15 feet 4.5 m long. Perhaps the situation can be compared with that of African big cats. If Phuwiangvenator yaemniyomi were a lion, Vayuraptor nongbualamphuenisis would be a cheetah, Samathi said. Megaraptors have so far been discovered mainly in South America and Australia, he added. We have compared the Thai fossils with the finds there. Various characteristics of Phuwiangvenator yaemniyomi indicate that it is an early representative of this group. We take this as an indication that the megaraptors originated in Southeast Asia and then spread to other regions. The study was published in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Find One-Billion-Year-Old Fossil Fungi in Canada", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "May 23, 2019", "doc": "An international team of paleontologists has discovered 1,000  to 900 million year old microfossils of a fungus in estuarine shale of the Grassy Bay Formation in Arctic Canada. These multicellular organic walled microfossils are more than half a billion years older than previously reported occurrences of fungi. Fungi are essential components of modern ecosystems and are among the first traces of life to colonize the continents, said University of Li\u00e8ge researcher Corentin Loron and colleagues. To date, the earliest fossil fungi are 410 million year old specimens from Scotland and spores of glomeromycotan fungi from Wisconsin that date to 450 million years ago, in the Ordovician period. The 1 0.9 billion year old Proterozoic era fossil fungi from the Grassy Bay Formation are older than these previously reported fossils by more than half a billion years. The paleontologists discovered abundant microfossils of a fungus named Ourasphaira giraldae. These fossilized specimens have a wall made of chitin, a fibrous compound that forms fungal cell walls. These organic walled microfossils consist of multicellular, branching filaments with terminal spheres, the scientists said. Transmitted light and scanning electron microscopy SEM examinations show smooth unornamented walls of filaments and spheres. SEM images also reveal the presence of locally well preserved and intertwined approximately 1520 nm thick microfibrils, which make up the walls. Ultrastructural analyses using transmission electron microscopy show that the flattened microfossils are hollow, with a bilayered wall that consists of an electron dense thick inner layer and a thin electron tenuous outer layer. This combination of complex morphology, right angle branching, multicellularity, bilayered wall ultrastructure, compositional recalcitrance and relatively large size permits the unambiguous placement of Ourasphaira giraldae among eukaryotes. Together they indicate the presence of a complex cytoskeleton, which is absent in prokaryotes. Extant fungi are mostly terrestrial, although some marine forms are known. Because Ourasphaira giraldae is preserved in shallow water estuarine shale of the Grassy Bay Formation, this fungus may have lived in an estuarine environment. The fungus may also have been transported into this estuarine setting from land or marine niches. The later colonization of terrestrial settings by fungi may have preceded and aided the colonization of land by plants through symbioses and through soil processing, which would have provided ecological niches, improved the substrate, nutrient uptake and increased aboveground productivity, the researchers said. As multidisciplinary studies of Proterozoic fossil assemblages progress, we predict that more fossil fungi and other early eukaryotes will be discovered and will improve our understanding of the evolution of the early biosphere. The discovery is reported in a paper published this week in the journal Nature.

The ammonite bearing piece of amber was obtained from a mine located near Noije Bum Village, Tanaing Town, northern Myanmar. It is 33 mm long, 9.5 mm wide, and 29 mm high, and its mass is about 6 g. The specimen was analyzed by Professor Bo Wang from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology and his colleagues from China, France, the United Kingdom and the United States. The researchers used X ray micro computed tomography to obtain high resolution 3D images of the ammonite, including its sutures, which are diagnostically important for ammonites. They found that the ammonite belongs to Puzosia, an ammonite genus that first appeared in the Upper Albian age of the Cretaceous period between 113 and 100 million years ago and ranged through the Cenomanian age between 100 and 94 million years ago. The ammonite is a juvenile, has a maximum preserved diameter of 12 mm, and appears to retain the original aragonitic shell, on the basis of its appearance in reflected light, they said. Its presence in the amber supports a late Albian early Cenomanian age for the amber deposit. This discovery represents a rare example of dating using amber inclusions. The team also found at least 40 individuals of arthropods in the amber sample from both land and marine habitats, including crustaceans, mites, spiders and millipedes, and several individuals of insects, including cockroaches, beetles, true flies and wasps. But how did the ammonite, an extinct sea dwelling relative of squid, and other marine creatures get preserved in a piece of amber that also contains land based animals? The ammonite and sea snail shells offer possible clues, the paleontologists said. The shells are all empty with no soft tissue, so the organisms were long dead by the time they were engulfed by resin. The outer shell of the ammonite is broken away and the entrance of the shell is full of sand. The amber also contains additional sand. The most likely explanation is that a sandy beach covered with shells was located close to resin producing trees. The flying insects were trapped in the resin while it was still on the tree. As the resin flowed down the tree trunk, it trapped organisms that lived near the foot of the tree. Reaching the beach, it entombed shells and trapped the slaters living there.

The discovery, reported in the May 9 issue of the journal Nature, sheds some new light on the origins of avian flight. Named Ambopteryx longibrachium, the new dinosaur lived approximately 163 million years ago Jurassic period in what is now China. The prehistoric creature had a body length of about 12.6 inches 32 cm and an estimated body mass of 300 g. It belongs to Scansoriopterygidae, an extinct family of climbing and gliding non avian theropod dinosaurs. Scansoriopterygids differ from other theropods in their body proportions, particularly in the proportions of the forelimb, which supports a bizarre wing structure first recognized in Yi qi, a close relative of Ambopteryx longibrachium, said team leader Dr. Min Wang and colleagues. Unlike other flying dinosaurs, namely birds, these two species have membranous wings supported by a rod like wrist bone that is not found in any other dinosaur, but is present in pterosaurs and flying squirrels.  A nearly complete skeleton of Ambopteryx longibrachium was unearthed near Wubaiding Village in Chinas Liaoning Province. Due to incomplete preservation in the only known specimen of Yi qi, the veracity of the unique wing structures and their exact function remained hotly debated, the paleontologists said. As the most completely preserved specimen to date, Ambopteryx longibrachium preserves membranous wings and the rod like wrist, supporting their widespread existence in Scansoriopterygidae. These wing structures represent a short lived and unsuccessful attempt to fly, they added. In contrast, feathered wings, first documented in Late Jurassic non avian dinosaurs, were further refined through the evolution of numerous skeletal and soft tissue modifications, giving rise to at least two additional independent origins of dinosaur flight and ultimately leading to the current success of modern birds.

The new dinosaur, named Suskityrannus hazelae, was a tiny relative of Tyrannosaurus rex, about 9 feet 2.7 m long and 3 feet 0.9 m tall at the hip. The ancient creature weighed between 20 and 41 kg, compared to a Tyrannosaurus rexs weight of up to 9 tons. Its diet likely consisted of the same as its larger meat eating counterpart, with Suskityrannus hazelae likely hunting small animals. Suskityrannus hazelae gives us a glimpse into the evolution of tyrannosaurs just before they take over the planet, said Dr. Sterling Nesbitt, a paleontologist in the Department of Geosciences at the Virginia Tech College of Science. It also belongs to a dinosaurian fauna that just proceeds the iconic dinosaurian faunas in the latest Cretaceous that include some of the most famous dinosaurs, such as\u00a0Triceratops, predators like Tyrannosaurus rex, and duckbill dinosaurs like Edmontosaurus. Two partial skeletons of Suskityrannus hazelae were found on 1990s expeditions to the Zuni Basin in western New Mexico. Suskityrannus hazelae has a much more slender skull and foot than its later and larger cousins, Tyrannosaurus rex, Dr. Nesbitt said. The find also links the older and smaller tyrannosauroids from North America and China with the much larger tyrannosaurids that lasted until the final extinction of non avian dinosaurs.

Millipedes are a highly diverse but also a largely understudied group of arthropods with over 11,000 described species. The actual number of species is estimated to be between 15,000 and 80,000. The entire Mesozoic Era  an interval of geological time from about 252 to 66 million years ago  is poor in millipede fossils, with less than a dozen species taxonomically described. Dubbed Burmanopetalum inexpectatum, the newly discovered millipede species lived approximately 99 million years ago Cretaceous period. The ancient creature, about 8.2 mm long, is encased in amber from the Hukawng Valley, Kachin State, northern Myanmar. It belongs to Callipodida, a small order of spinneret carrying millipedes.  We were so lucky to find this specimen so well preserved in amber, said lead author Professor Pavel Stoev, a researcher at the National Museum of Natural History, Bulgaria. With the next generation micro CT and the associated image rendering and processing software, we are now able to reconstruct the whole animal and observe the tiniest morphological traits which are rarely preserved in fossils. This makes us confident that we have successfully compared its morphology with those of the extant millipedes. It came as a great surprise to us that this animal cannot be placed in the current millipede classification. Even though their general appearance have remained unchanged in the last 100 million years, as our planet underwent dramatic changes several times in this period, some morphological traits in Callipodida lineage have evolved significantly. Professor Stoev and colleagues had to revise the current millipede classification and introduce a new suborder Burmanopetalidea and a new family Burmanopetalidae. The Mesozoic Era has until now only been sampled for a dozen species of millipedes, but new findings from Burmese amber are rapidly changing the picture, said Natural History Museum Londons Dr. Greg Edgecombe, leading expert in the study of fossil arthropods.

Callichimaera perplexa means perplexing beautiful chimera was about the size of a quarter and had large and unprotected compound eyes, bent claws, leg like mouth parts, exposed tail, and small body. It is the earliest example of a swimming arthropod with paddle like legs since the extinction of sea scorpions more than 250 million years ago.  These are features typical of crab larvae from the open sea, said team leader Dr. Javier Luque, a paleontologist at Yale University. This suggests that some ancient crabs may have retained a few of their larval traits into adulthood, amplified them, and developed new body architecture. This is an evolutionary process called heterochrony. The ancient creature is so unique and strange that it can be considered the platypus of the crab world. It hints at how novel forms evolve and become so disparate through time, Dr. Luque said. Usually we think of crabs as big animals with broad carapaces, strong claws, small eyes in long eyestalks, and a small tail tucked under the body. Well, Callichimaera perplexa defies all of these crabby features and forces a re think of our definition of what makes a crab a crab. The discovery is reported in the journal Science Advances.

Dubbed Simbakubwa kutokaafrika means Big lion from Africa in Swahili, the gigantic carnivore lived about 22 million years ago Early Miocene epoch in what is now Kenya. The ancient creature was the size of a small rhinoceros and had a body mass of up to 1,500 kg. Its fossilized remains have been owned by the National Museums of Kenya since the 1980s, but sat in its archives until a closer look revealed they held information about the previosuly unknown mammal. Opening a museum drawer, we saw a row of gigantic meat eating teeth, clearly belonging to a species new to science, said Dr. Matthew Borths, a paleontologist at Ohio University. Simbakubwa kutokaafrika was not closely related to big cats or any other mammalian carnivore alive today. Instead, the animal belonged to Hyaenodonta hyaenodonts, an extinct group of predatory mammals. For about 45 million years after the extinction of the non avian dinosaurs, hyaenodonts were the apex predators in Africa. Then, after millions of years of near isolation, tectonic movements of the Earths plates connected Africa with the northern continents, allowing floral and faunal exchange between landmasses. Around the time of Simbakubwa kutokaafrika, the relatives of cats, hyenas, and dogs began to arrive in Africa from Eurasia. As the relatives of cats and dogs were going south, the relatives of Simbakubwa kutokaafrika were going north. Its a fascinating time in biological history. Lineages that had never encountered each other begin to appear together in the fossil record, Dr. Borths said. Simbakubwa kutokaafrika is the oldest of the gigantic hyaenodonts, suggesting this lineage of giant carnivores likely originated on the African continent and moved northward to flourish for millions of years. Ultimately, hyaenodonts worldwide went extinct. Global ecosystems were changing between 18 and 15 million years ago as grasslands replaced forests and new mammalian lineages diversified. We dont know exactly what drove hyaenodonts to extinction, but ecosystems were changing quickly as the global climate became drier. The gigantic relatives of Simbakubwa kutokaafrika were among the last hyaenodonts on the planet, Dr. Borths said. This is a pivotal fossil, demonstrating the significance of museum collections for understanding evolutionary history, added Professor Nancy Stevens, also from Ohio University. Simbakubwa kutokaafrika is a window into a bygone era. As ecosystems shifted, a key predator disappeared, heralding Cenozoic faunal transitions that eventually led to the evolution of the modern African fauna.

Members of the dinosaur family Hadrosauridae, also known as duck billed dinosaurs, were widespread and ecologically important large herbivores during the Late Cretaceous epoch, but little is known about their early evolution. In recent years, many new hadrosaurid species have been filling in this picture, but few complete remains are known from the early part of the Late Cretaceous, which is when the group originated. Dr. Khishigjav Tsogtbataaar from the Mongolian Academy of Science and colleagues found a new species closely related to Hadrosauridae, Gobihadros mongoliensis. An almost complete and undeformed skull and skeleton of this dinosaur, as well as extensive referred material, were unearthed in the Bayshin Tsav region of the Gobi Desert. An anatomical analysis revealed that Gobihadros mongoliensis doesnt quite fit into Hadrosauridae, but is a very close cousin, making it the first such dinosaur known from complete remains from the Late Cretaceous of central Asia. Gobihadros mongoliensis did not directly give rise to later Asian hadrosaurs, the paleontologists said. Instead, those Asian hadrosaurs appear to have migrated over from North America during the Late Cretaceous. The new species and its close Asian relatives seem to disappear as these new hadrosaurs enter Asia, suggesting that the invaders might have ultimately outcompeted species like Gobihadros mongoliensis.

The end Permian extinction, also known as the Permian Triassic extinction event and the Great Dying, is the largest mass extinction event in Earths history. The catastrophe killed off nearly 96 of all marine species on the planet over the course of thousands of years. The main cause of the extinction is generally thought to be linked to severe environmental perturbations caused by eruptions in a volcanic system called the Siberian Traps. Many of the eruptions occurred not in cone shaped volcanoes but through gaping fissures in the ground. The eruptions ignited vast deposits of coal, releasing mercury vapor high into the atmosphere. Eventually, it rained down into the marine sediment around the planet, creating an elemental signature of a catastrophe that would herald the age of dinosaurs. Volcanic activities, including emissions of volcanic gases and combustion of organic matter, released abundant mercury to the surface of the Earth, said study lead author Dr. Jun Shen, a researcher at the China University of Geosciences. Typically, when you have large, explosive volcanic eruptions, a lot of mercury is released into the atmosphere, added University of Cincinnatis Professor Thomas Algeo, co author of the study. Mercury is a relatively new indicator for researchers. It has become a hot topic for investigating volcanic influences on major events in Earths history. The researchers used the sharp fossilized teeth of lamprey like creatures called conodonts to date the rock in which the mercury was deposited. Like most other creatures on the planet, conodonts were decimated by the catastrophe. The eruptions propelled as much as 3 million km3 of ash high into the air over this extended period. In fact, the Siberian Traps eruptions spewed so much material in the air, particularly greenhouse gases, that it warmed the planet by an average of about 10 degrees centigrade, Professor Algeo said. The warming climate likely would have been one of the biggest culprits in the mass extinction. But acid rain would have spoiled many bodies of water and raised the acidity of the global oceans. And the warmer water would have had more dead zones from a lack of dissolved oxygen. Were often left scratching our heads about what exactly was most harmful. Creatures adapted to colder environments would have been out of luck. So my guess is temperature change would be the No. 1 killer. Effects would exacerbated by acidification and other toxins in the environment. Stretching over an extended period, eruption after eruption prevented the Earths food chain from recovering. Its not necessarily the intensity but the duration that matters. The longer this went on, the more pressure was placed on the environment, Professor Algeo said. Likewise, the Earth was slow to recover from the disaster because the ongoing disturbances continued to wipe out biodiversity. The mercury signature provides convincing evidence that the Siberian Traps eruptions were responsible for the catastrophe, Dr. Shen said. The study appears in the journal Nature Communications.

These are the first tracks ever found where perfect skin impressions cover the entire surface of every track, said University of Colorado Denvers Professor Martin Lockley. They were made on a very thin layer of fine mud, rather like a coat of fresh paint only a millimeter thick. When the tiny dinosaur stepped on this firm, sticky surface, the skin texture of the foot was reproduced perfectly, without slipping or sliding. Evidence shows that, just before the tracks were made, there had been a rain shower leaving water drop impressions. In one place, the dinosaur had stepped on a fresh rain drop mark, proving rain came first, and the dinosaur step came second. All this delicate evidence was preserved by being gently covered with more fine mud. The skin pattern as similar to examples from much larger, carnivorous theropod dinosaur tracks, in which scales are much larger but never preserved across the whole footprint, Professor Lockley and colleagues said. The more distantly related giant brontosaurs had scales that left traces 0.8 1.2 inches 2 3 cm in diameter. So the delicate, perfectly preserved Minisauripus skin texture is like a shrunken version of the skin of a much larger relative, with no shrinkage of the skin traces.

The researchers named the new species Sollasina cthulhu due to its resemblance to monsters from the fictional Cthulhu universe created by author H.P. Lovecraft. Although the animal was just 1.2 inches 3 cm wide, its many long tentacles tube feet would have made it appear quite monstrous to other small sea creatures alive at the time. It is thought that these tentacles were used to capture food and crawl over the seafloor. Thirteen specimens of Sollasina cthulhu were collected from a single locality of the Herefordshire Lagerst\u00e4tte a geologists term for a deposit of extraordinarily well preserved fossils. One exceptionally well preserved specimen was selected for detailed study by physical optical tomography. The 3D reconstruction allowed the paleontologists to visualize Sollasina cthulhus internal ring, which they interpreted as part of the water vascular system  the system of fluid filled canals used for feeding and movement in living sea cucumbers and their relatives. Sollasina cthulhu belongs to an extinct group called the ophiocistioids, and this new material provides the first information on the groups internal structures, said Dr. Imran Rahman, from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. This includes an inner ring like form that has never been described in the group before. We interpret this as the first evidence of the soft parts of the water vascular system in ophiocistioids. The new fossil was incorporated into a computerized analysis of the evolutionary relationships of fossil sea cucumbers and sea urchins. The results showed that Sollasina cthulhu and its relatives are most closely related to sea cucumbers, rather than sea urchins, shedding new light on the evolutionary history of the group. We carried out a number of analyses to work out whether Sollasina cthulhu was more closely related to sea cucumbers or sea urchins, said Dr. Jeffrey Thompson, from University College London. To our surprise, the results suggest it was an ancient sea cucumber. This helps us understand the changes that occurred during the early evolution of the group, which ultimately gave rise to the slug like forms we see today.

"}, {"title": " New Species of Extinct Pig-Footed Bandicoot Discovered", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 9, 2019", "doc": "An international team of researchers from Australia and the United Kingdom has discovered a new species of pig footed bandicoot which has been extinct for more than half a century. The pig footed bandicoot Chaeropus ecaudatus was unique, and unlike any other mammal due to its ability to walk on two toes on its front legs, and one toe on its hind legs. The pig footed bandicoot was one of the most unique, and possibly one of the weirdest animals on the planet. No other mammal walked on two toes on its front legs and one toe on its hind legs, said lead author Dr. Kenny Travouillon, curator of mammalogy at the Western Australian Museum. The animal was believed to be amongst the smallest grazing mammals that have ever lived and its speed, for its size, was legendary. The pig footed bandicoot evolved along with bilbies and other bandicoots more than 20 million years ago and was found throughout central and south Australia and in Victoria. The species was named and scientifically described in 1838 by the Irish naturalist William Ogilby. Aboriginal people knew about these animals for around 65,000 years before the marsupials were first recorded by Europeans in 1838, Dr. Travouillon and colleagues said. Unfortunately it took just over 150 years from its discovery by Europeans for it to go extinct. The last bandicoots are thought to have vanished by the 1950s. The rapid extinction of the pig footed bandicoot means that it was never properly studied in its environment, so little is known about these extraordinary animals or their ecology and behavior. To better understand these bizarre creatures, we reassessed all 29 modern pig footed bandicoot remains that survive including bones, taxidermy animals and wet specimens, as well as fossil and subfossil bones held in museums and universities around the world. By using a combination of traditional morphology, morphometrics, paleontology and molecular phylogenetics, the scientists discovered there were in fact two different species. DNA from specimens collected by Sir Thomas Mitchell in 1946 confirmed the existence of two species. Although very similar, the two species have some distinct differences, Dr. Travouillon said. The newly identified species, named Chaeropus yirratji, has fewer holes in its palate compared to Chaeropus ecaudatus and it has different shaped teeth, suggesting different diets. Chaeropus yirratji also has much longer feet, meaning it would have been able to take longer strides and therefore move faster. While knowledge of this new species arrived too late to save it from extinction, hopefully the lesson learnt demonstrates the urgency and importance of supporting biodiversity research, said Roberto Portela Miguez, senior curator in charge of mammals at the Natural History Museum in London. The team also used fossil records and Aboriginal oral accounts recorded in the 1980s to trace the two species distribution. Chaeropus yirratji was thought to have lived in sandy environments in central Australia and Chaeropus ecaudatus lived in the southern peripheral areas of the arid zone of Australia. Both species were thought to inhabit areas of Western Australia. This research increases our understanding of past biodiversity and enhances our knowledge of the diversity of mammals. It also helps build a more comprehensive picture of the true impact we had and are still having on the natural world, Miguez said. Every species matters because each species plays a part in the ecosystems they naturally occur and the extinction of one species could lead to the collapse of these complex systems. The research is published in the journal Zootaxa.

Named Peregocetus pacificus, the four legged whale lived approximately 43 million years ago middle Eocene epoch. Its skeleton was discovered in marine sediments at Playa Media Luna on the southern coast of Peru. It was analyzed by Dr. Olivier Lambert of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and his colleagues from Italy, France and Peru. This is the first indisputable record of a quadrupedal whale skeleton for the whole Pacific Ocean, probably the oldest for the Americas, and the most complete outside India and Pakistan, Dr. Lambert said. Anatomical details of the skeleton allowed the paleontologists to infer that the animal was capable of maneuvering its large body up to 4 m, or 13 feet, long, tail included, both on land and in the water. For instance, features of the caudal vertebrae in the tail are reminiscent of those of beavers and otters, suggesting a significant contribution of the tail during swimming. The presence of small hooves at the tip of the whales fingers and toes and its hip and limbs morphology all suggest that this whale could walk on land, Dr. Lambert and co authors explained. On the other hand, anatomical features of the tail and feet, including long, likely webbed appendages, similar to an otter, indicate that it was a good swimmer too. The geological age of Peregocetus pacificus and its presence along the western coast of South America strongly support the hypothesis that early cetaceans reached the New World across the South Atlantic, from the western coast of Africa to South America. The whales would have been assisted in their travel by westward surface currents and by the fact that, at the time, the distance between the two continents was half what it is today, the researchers said. Only after having reached South America, the amphibious whales migrated northward, finally reaching North America. The research was published online this week in the journal Current Biology. "}, {"title": " 66-Million-Year-Old Fossil Site Preserves Animals Killed within Minutes of Chicxulub Impact", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 3, 2019", "doc": "At a site dubbed Tanis in North Dakotas Hell Creek Formation, paleontologists have unearthed an assemblage of exquisitely preserved fossilized organisms  fish stacked one atop another and mixed in with burned tree trunks, conifer branches, mammals, mosasaur bones, insects, the partial carcass of a Triceratops, marine microorganisms called dinoflagellates and snail like marine cephalopods called ammonites  that were killed suddenly in events triggered by the Chicxulub asteroid or comet strike off Mexicos Yucatan Peninsula, the impact that eradicated about 75 of Earths animal and plant species 66 million years ago. University of Kansas researcher Robert DePalma and his colleagues determined that the Tanis fish could not have been stranded and then buried by a typical tsunami, a single wave that would have reached this previously unknown arm of the Western Interior Seaway no less than 10 to 12 hours after the Chicxulub impact 1,864 miles 3,000 km away, if it didnt peter out before then. The tektites  glass beads formed in the atmosphere from rock melted by the impact  would have rained down within 45 min to an hour of the impact, unable to create mudholes if the seabed had not already been exposed, the paleontologists said. Instead, seismic waves likely arrived within 10 min of the impact from what would have been the equivalent of a magnitude 10 or 11 earthquake, creating a seiche standing wave in the inland sea that is similar to water sloshing in a bathtub during an earthquake. The seismic waves start arising within 9 10 min of the impact, so they had a chance to get the water sloshing before all the spherules had fallen out of the sky, said Professor Mark Richards, from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Washington. These spherules coming in cratered the surface, making funnels  you can see the deformed layers in what used to be soft mud  and then rubble covered the spherules. No one has seen these funnels before. The tektites would have come in on a ballistic trajectory from space, reaching terminal velocities of between 100 and 200 mph 161 322 kmh, said University of California, Berkeleys Professor Walter Alvarez. A tangled mass of freshwater fish, terrestrial vertebrates, trees, branches, logs, marine ammonites and other marine creatures was all packed into this layer by the inland directed surge, DePalma said. Timing of the incoming ejecta spherules matched the calculated arrival times of seismic waves from the impact, suggesting that the impact could very well have triggered the surge. Before the surge arrived, acipenseriform fish sturgeon at the Tanis site already had inhaled spherules ejected from the impact. The fish were buried quickly, but not so quickly they didnt have time to breathe the ejecta that was raining down to the river, said University of Kansas Professor David Burnham. These fish werent bottom feeders, they breathed these in while swimming in the water column. Were finding little pieces of ejecta in the gill rakers of these fish, the bony supports for the gills. We dont know if some were killed by breathing this ejecta, too.  The number and quality of preservation of the fossils at the site are such that the team dubs it the Lagerst\u00e4tte of the KT event  a landmark sedimentary deposit with exceptionally intact specimens. This is especially true as the fish are cartilaginous, not bony, and are less prone to fossilization, Professor Burnham noted. The sedimentation happened so quickly everything is preserved in 3D  theyre not crushed. Its like an avalanche that collapses almost like a liquid, then sets like concrete. They were killed pretty suddenly because of the violence of that water. We have one fish that hit a tree and was broken in half. Indeed, the Tanis site contains many hundreds of articulated ancient fossil fish killed by the Chicxulub impacts aftereffects and is remarkable for the biodiversity it reveals alone. At least several appear to be new species, and the others are the best examples known of their kind, DePalma said. The fossil trove fills a void in scientific knowledge with vivid new detail, Professor Burnham said. Weve understood that bad things happened right after the impact, but nobodys found this kind of smoking gun evidence. People have said, We get that this blast killed the dinosaurs, but why dont we have dead bodies everywhere? Well, now we have bodies. Theyre not dinosaurs, but I think those will eventually be found, too. The research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Mastodons are any species of extinct proboscideans in the genus Mammut. Often confused with mammoths, they are another, more distant, relative of living elephants. These animals were widespread across North America and Central America during the Pliocene epoch up to their extinction at the end of the Pleistocene period around 11,000 years ago. Over five species are currently recognized, including the well known American mastodon Mammut americanum that had a widespread distribution across nearly every U.S. state, Canada, and Mexico. The newly identified species, named the Pacific mastodon Mammut pacificus, was widespread in California west of the Sierra Nevada, and was present as far northeast as southern Idaho. For decades, the consensus on Pleistocene mastodons which I shared was that in North America there was only a single, widespread species, the American mastodon, said Dr. Alton Dooley, executive director of the Western Science Center. Four years ago, I stumbled across the fact that California mastodons have different tooth proportions than other mastodons. A group of us started exploring that issue, trying to determine what was going on. According to the team, the Pacific mastodon had a thicker femur and narrower teeth than the American mastodon. It had six sacral vertebrae, while the American mastodon usually had five, and had no mandibular tusks, while they still occurred in about 25 of American mastodon population. All known Pleistocene mastodon remains from California are consistent with our diagnosis of the Pacific mastodon, which indicates that the American mastodon was not present in California, Dr. Dooley and colleagues said. Pacific mastodons were apparently absent from the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts, including from heavily sampled localities such as Tule Springs in Nevada, the added. These deserts, along with the high, steep, and at times glaciated Sierra Nevada and the possible patchiness of appropriate habitats in the Basin and Range and Rocky Mountains, may have served as effective geographic barriers to mastodon dispersal. A detailed description of the Pacific mastodon appears in the journal PeerJ.

An international team of paleontologists has discovered an early Cambrian fossil site in China  the Qingjiang biota  that contains a variety of specimens, more than half of which are previously undescribed. The 518 million year old fossil site rivals previously described Cambrian sites, such as the Burgess Shale of British Columbia and the Chengjiang fossil site in Chinas Yunnan province, and should help to elucidate biological innovation and diversification during the Cambrian period. A little more than 500 million years ago, early animal life on Earth exploded in diversity and form in an evolutionary event that would graft the initial branches of most major animal phyla onto the tree of animal life  the Cambrian explosion. Much of what is known about the Cambrian explosion has been learned from the fossil record at sites where the geological echoes of this early life have been preserved. Perhaps no other assemblages to date have been more important to our understanding of the Cambrian explosion than the Burgess Shale and Chengjiang localities  both of which contain large and diverse collections of well preserved fossils, including soft bodied organisms, which rarely make it into the fossil record. The discovery of the Qingjiang site  new Burgess Shale type Lagerst\u00e4tte a geologists term for a deposit of extraordinarily well preserved fossils  was made by Northwest Universitys Dr. Dongjing Fu and colleagues from Guizhou University, Northwest University and Pomona College almost by accident. The paleontologists were working in the mountains and came down to the banks of the Danshui River, located in Hubei Province, when they noticed some rocks had an odd pin striped pattern  a telltale sign of layers of mud deposited rapidly by ancient storms similar to those found at the famous Chengjiang site. In addition to the high taxonomic diversity, Qingjiang fossils are characterized by near pristine preservation of soft bodied organisms  including juvenile or larval forms, arthropod and worm cuticles and jellyfishes  and such soft tissue features as eyes, gills and guts. More than 4,000 specimens have already been collected, with 101 species identified  of these species, 53 are new to science and names have to yet to be assigned. This finding enriches our view of the early animal world and offers us really remarkable views of the simplest animals, said team member Professor Robert Gaines, from Pomona College. One of the most incredible things about this finding is the pristine condition of many of these specimens  fossils that havent been substantially affected by impacts of time, and in them you can clearly see soft tissues like eyes, tentacles and gills. The discovery promises to shed light on the evolution of Cambrian ecosystems across space and time. Nowhere do have a more pristine fossil record of early Cambrian life and such a diversity of organisms  and this is just the beginning.

Scotty was 42.7 feet 13 m long and weighed approximately 8,870 kg. The large, relatively complete roughly 65 skeleton was found in a layer of the Frenchman Formation near Eastend, Saskatchewan, in 1991. The bones were encased in iron stained, heavily cemented sandstone, which took more than a decade to remove. Its only recently, after several more years piecing together the specimen like a jigsaw puzzle, that paleontologists have been able to study the specimen. This is the rex of rexes, said Dr. Scott Persons IV, a paleontologist in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Alberta. There is considerable size variability among Tyrannosaurus. Some individuals were lankier than others and some were more robust. Scotty exemplifies the robust. He comes out a bit heftier than other T. rex specimens. Scotty is the oldest T. rex known, said Dr. Persons, first author of a paper published in the journal Anatomical Record. By which I mean, it would have had the most candles on its last birthday cake. You can get an idea of how old a dinosaur is by cutting into its bones and studying its growth patterns. Scotty is all old growth. But age is relative, and T. rexes grew fast and died young. Scotty was estimated to have been in its early 30s when it died. By Tyrannosaurus standards, it had an unusually long life. And it was a violent one, Dr. Persons said. Riddled across the skeleton are pathologies  spots where scarred bone records large injuries. Among Scottys injuries are broken ribs, an infected jaw and what may be a bite from another T. rex on its tail  battle scars from a long life. I think there will always be bigger discoveries to be made. But as of right now, this particular Tyrannosaurus is the largest terrestrial predator known to science, Dr. Persons said. "}, {"title": " Evidence from Chile Supports Younger Dryas Extraterrestrial Impact Hypothesis", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 20, 2019", "doc": "The Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, also known as Clovis comet hypothesis, posits that the hemisphere wide debris field of a large, disintegrating asteroid or comet struck North America, South America, Europe, and western Asia approximately 12,800 years ago. This event triggered extensive biomass burning, brief impact winter, climate change, and contributed to extinctions of late Pleistocene megafauna. Controversial from the time it was proposed, this hypothesis continues to be contested by those who prefer to attribute the end Pleistocene reversal in warming entirely to terrestrial causes. Now, University of California, Santa Barbaras Professor James Kennett and co authors present further geologic and paleontological evidence of the cosmic impact, this time far south of the equator. We have identified the Younger Dryas boundary YDB layer at high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere at near 41 degrees south, close to the tip of South America. This is a major expansion of the extent of the YDB event, Professor James Kennett said. The vast majority of evidence to date has been found in the Northern Hemisphere. This discovery began several years ago when a group of Chilean scientists studying sediment layers at a well known Quaternary paleontological and archaeological site, Pilauco Bajo, recognized changes known to be associated with YDB impact event. They included a black mat layer, 12,800 years in age, that coincided with the disappearance of South American Pleistocene megafauna fossils, an abrupt shift in regional vegetation and a disappearance of human artifacts. The analyses of the Pilauco sediments yielded the presence of microscopic spherules interpreted to have been formed by melting due to the extremely high temperatures associated with impact. The layer containing these spherules also show peak concentrations of platinum and gold, and native iron particles rarely found in nature. Among the most important spherules are those that are chromium rich, Professor Kennett said. The spherules from the Pilauco site contain an unusual level of chromium, an element not found in Northern Hemisphere YDB impact spherules, but in South America. It turns out that volcanic rocks in the southern Andes can be rich in chromium, and these rocks provided a local source for this chromium. Thus, the cometary objects must have hit South America as well, Professor Kennett explained. Other evidence, which is consistent with previous and ongoing documentation of the region by Chilean scientists, pointed to a very large environmental disruption at about 40 degrees south. These included a large biomass burning event evidenced by, among other things, micro charcoal and signs of burning in pollen samples collected at the impact layer. Furthermore, the burning coincides with the timing of major YDB related burning events in North America and western Europe. The sedimentary layers at Pilauco contain a valuable record of pollen and seeds that show change in character of regional vegetation  evidence of a shifting climate. However, in contrast to the Northern Hemisphere, where conditions became colder and wetter at the onset of the Younger Dryas, the opposite occurred in the Southern Hemisphere. The plant assemblages indicate that there was an abrupt and major shift in the vegetation from wet, cold conditions at Pilauco to warm, dry conditions. The atmospheric zonal climatic belts shifted like a seesaw, with a synergistic mechanism, bringing warming to the Southern Hemisphere even as the Northern Hemisphere experienced cooling and expanding sea ice. The rapidity  within a few years  with which the climate shifted is best attributed to impact related shifts in atmospheric systems, rather than to the slower oceanic processes, Professor Kennett said. Meanwhile, the impact with its associated major environmental effects, including burning, is thought to have contributed to the extinction of local South American Pleistocene megafauna as well as the termination of the culture similar to the Clovis culture in the north. The amount of bones, artifacts and megafauna associated fungi that were relatively abundant in the soil at the Pilauco site declined precipitously at the impact layer, indicating a major local disruption. The distance of the Pilauco site  3,728 miles 6,000 km from the closest well studied site in South America  and its correlation with the many Northern Hemispheric sites greatly expands the extent of the YD impact event. The sedimentary and paleo vegetative evidence gathered at the site is in line with previous, separate studies conducted by Chilean scientists that indicate a widespread burn and sudden major climate shifts in the region at about YDB onset. This new study further bolsters the hypothesis that a cosmic impact triggered the atmospheric and oceanic conditions of the Younger Dryas, Professor Kennett said. The findings appear in the journal Scientific Reports.

Now a team of scientists in Japan has recovered the less damaged nucleus like structures from Yukas remains and visualized their dynamics in living mouse eggs oocytes after a procedure called nuclear transfer. Yuka was discovered in the summer of 2010 in a cave near the village of Yukagir in the Republic of Sakha. The young female specimen is the most intact and well preserved woolly mammoth ever found. In the study, we obtained bone marrow and muscle tissue from Yuka and attempted to decipher various biological information and to restore cell nuclear function, said team leader Dr. Akira Iritani of Kindai University and colleagues. First, we compared the genetic information of Yuka with African elephants and confirmed the characteristic single base substitution and amino acid substitution possessed by mammoths. The researchers performed proteomic analysis of the mammoth remains and demonstrated the presence of nucleus like structures in the samples. They then extracted the cell nuclei from the remains and transplanted them into the mouse oocytes. The mass spectroscopy analysis of the protein preservation state showed that the muscle tissue of Yuka was preserved in a relatively good state and the components of cell nuclei were present, they explained. We then extracted the nuclei from the muscle tissue, injected them into the mouse oocytes using a micromanipulator, and observed the reaction after nuclear transfer using a disk type confocal laser microscope. This resulted in some mammoth cell nuclei beginning to take up mouse cell nuclear proteins in the mouse oocytes, and cells shaped as those do before division were observed. Furthermore, a part of the mammoth nuclei started to form a partial nucleus like structure, and this newly formed structure was eventually incorporated into the cell nucleus of the mouse oocyte.    This research is a pioneering achievement that demonstrates for the first time in the world that some well preserved mammoth fossils retain cell nuclei that can be reconstituted in the currently living embryos, the study authors said. The results appear in the journal Scientific Reports.

The new dinosaur belongs to Ornithopoda ornithopods, a major group of herbivorous bird hipped dinosaurs. Dubbed Galleonosaurus dorisae, it inhabited the rift between Australia and Antarctica approximately 125 million years ago Cretaceous period. Five fossilized upper jaws of the ancient beast were found at the Flat Rocks locality of the Wonthaggi Formation in a region of Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. Galleonosaurus is the fifth small ornithopod genus named from Victoria, said Dr. Matthew Herne, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of New England. The discovery confirms that on a global scale, the diversity of these small bodied dinosaurs had been unusually high in the ancient rift valley that once extended between the spreading continents of Australia and Antarctica. Small ornithopods appear to have thrived on the vast forested floodplain within the ancient rift valley. Galleonosaurus dorisae is a close relative of Diluvicursor pickeringi, another small ornithopod named by Dr. Herne and co authors in 2018, from excavations along the Otway coast to the west of the Gippsland region. Interestingly, the jaws of the new species and the partial skeleton of Diluvicursor pickeringi were similarly buried in volcanic sediments on the floor of deep powerful rivers, Dr. Herne said. However, Galleonosaurus dorisae is about 12 million years older than Diluvicursor pickeringi, showing that the evolutionary history of dinosaurs in the Australian Antarctic rift had been lengthy. Prior to discovery of Galleonosaurus dorisae, the only other ornithopod known from the Gippsland region was Qantassaurus intrepidus, named in 1999. However, Qantassaurus intrepidus had a shorter more robust snout than that of Galleonosaurus dorisae, Dr. Herne said. We consider that these two, similarly sized dinosaurs fed on different plant types, which would have allowed them to coexist. The researchers also found that the ornithopods from Victoria are closely related to those from Patagonia in Argentina. We are steadily building a picture of terrestrial dinosaur interchange between the shifting Gondwanan continents of Australia, South America and Antarctica during the Cretaceous period, Dr. Herne noted. The study was published in the Journal of Paleontology.

The Pan American sloth had a distribution from southern Brazil to the Gulf and Atlantic coast regions of North America. This animal could reach a length of 20 feet 6 m, which, in an upright position, would have permitted it to feed at higher levels in trees. In 2014, divers found the fossil remains of a 27,000 year old Pan American sloth  parts of a tooth, humerus and femur  while searching for ancient Maya artifacts in a water filled sinkhole in Cara Blanca, Belize. Though partially fossilized, the tooth still held enough unaltered tissue for stable carbon and oxygen isotope analysis, which provided clues to what the sloth ate in the last year of its life. This, in turn, revealed much about the local climate and environment of the region at the time. Our findings add to the evidence that many factors, in addition to a changing climate, contributed to the extinction of megafauna in the Americas, said co lead author Professor Lisa Lucero, from the Department of Anthropology at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. One of those potential factors is the arrival of humans on the scene 12,000 to 13,000 years ago. The teeth of giant sloths like the one found in Belize, Eremotherium laurillardi, differ from those of other large mammals, like mammoths, that went extinct between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago, said first author Jean Larmon, a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Giant sloth teeth have no enamel, the hard, outer layer of human and some animal teeth that can be analyzed to learn about their diet. By using cathodoluminescence microscopy, a technique that causes minerals to glow and can detect the extent of mineralization in fossils, the researchers discovered that one type of tooth tissue, the dense orthodentin, was largely intact. They drilled 20 samples of orthodentin for isotopic analysis along the 3.9 inch 10 cm long tooth fragment, spanning more than a year of tooth growth. This allowed us to trace monthly and seasonal changes in the sloths diet and climate for the first time, and also to select the best part of the tooth for reliable radiocarbon dating, said Professor Stanley Ambrose, also from the Department of Anthropology at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. The isotopic analysis revealed that the giant sloth lived through a long dry season, which lasted about seven months, sandwiched between two short rainy seasons. It also revealed that the creature lived in a savanna, rather than a forest, and consumed a variety of plants that differed between wet and dry seasons. We were able to see that this huge, social creature was able to adapt rather readily to the dry climate, shifting its subsistence to relying upon what was more available or palatable, Larmon said. This supports the idea that the sloths had a diverse diet. That helps explain why they were so widespread and why they lasted so long. Its likely because they were highly adaptable, Professor Lucero said. The findings were published in the journal Science Advances.

However, there is debate about whether dinosaurs were flourishing before this, or whether they had been in decline due to in climate change. Now, in a study that modeled the changing environment and dinosaur species distribution in North America, a team of researchers has shown that dinosaurs were likely not in decline before the Chicxulub strike. Dinosaurs were likely not doomed to extinction until the end of the Cretaceous, when the asteroid hit, declaring the end of their reign and leaving the planet to animals like mammals, lizards and a minor group of surviving dinosaurs birds, said study lead author Alessandro Chiarenza, a PhD student at Imperial College London. The results of our study suggest that dinosaurs as a whole were adaptable animals, capable of coping with the environmental changes and climatic fluctuations that happened during the last few million years of the Late Cretaceous. Climate change over prolonged time scales did not cause a long term decline of dinosaurs through the last stages of this period. The study shows how the changing conditions for fossilization means previous analyses have underestimated the number of species at the end of the Cretaceous period. Chiarenza and colleagues focused their study on North America, where many Late Cretaceous dinosaurs are preserved. During this period, the continent was split in two by a large inland sea. In the western half there was a steady supply of sediment from the newly forming Rocky Mountains, which created perfect conditions for fossilizing dinosaurs once they died. The eastern half of the continent was instead characterized by conditions far less suitable for fossilization. This means that far more dinosaur fossils are found in the western half, and it is this fossil record that is often used to suggest dinosaurs were in decline for the few million years before the asteroid strike. Most of what we know about Late Cretaceous North American dinosaurs comes from an area smaller than one third of the present day continent, and yet we know that dinosaurs roamed all across North America, from Alaska to New Jersey and down to Mexico, said co author Dr. Philip Mannion, a paleontologist at University College London. Instead of using this known record exclusively, the researchers employed ecological niche modeling. This approach models which environmental conditions, such as temperature and rainfall, each species needs to survive. The scientists then mapped where these conditions would occur both across the continent and over time. This allowed them to create a picture of where groups of dinosaur species could survive as conditions changed, rather than just where their fossils had been found. The team found habitats that could support a range of dinosaur groups were actually more widespread at the end of the Cretaceous period, but that these were in areas less likely to preserve fossils. Furthermore, these potentially dinosaur rich areas were smaller wherever they occurred, again reducing the likelihood of finding a fossil from each of these areas. The findings appear today in the journal Nature Communications.

The newly discovered sea cow, named Culebratherium alemani, is a tusked seagrass grazing relative of modern dugongs. While only one species of dugong is alive today  a second, Stellers sea cow, was hunted to extinction within 27 years of its discovery  about 30 species have been recovered in the fossil record, said Dr. Jorge Velez Juarbe, a paleontologist in the Department of Mammalogy at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and the Department of Paleobiology at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. The group originated in the West Atlantic and Caribbean and dispersed westward through Panama, whose seaway did not close until a few million years ago, and south to Brazil. The fossil skull, vertebrae, ribs and other bones of Culebratherium alemani were recovered from marine deposits of the Culebra Cut of the Panama Canal. About 15 feet 4.6 m long, this individual was not done growing, Dr. Velez Juarbe said. Its tusks had only begun to protrude and its newest molars showed little wear, indicating it was not yet an adult. But it was a powerful eater. Dr. Velez Juarbe and his colleague, Dr. Aaron Wood from Iowa State University and the Florida Museum of Natural History, propose that Culebratherium alemanis thick neck muscles, tusks and downward pointing snout were adaptations for digging pits in the ocean floor to get to the underground stems of seagrass, the plants most nutritional parts. Finding Culebratherium alemani is pretty good evidence that there was seagrass in this region 20 million years ago, Dr. Velez Juarbe said. This particular group of sirenians are seagrass specialists.

The newly discovered microfossils represent the first known and earliest equatorial remains of a salientian  the group containing living frogs and their most closely related fossil relatives  from the Late Triassic, roughly 216 million years ago. They came from the Chinle Formation of Arizona and are composed of several small pieces of hip bone, called an ilium. This new find highlights just how much there is still to learn about the Late Triassic ecosystem, and how much we find when we just look a little closer, said Dr. Michelle Stocker, a researcher in the Department of Geosciences at Virginia Tech. Were familiar with the charismatic archosaurs from the Chinle Formation, but we know that based on other ecosystems, they should make up a small percentage of the animals that lived together. With this new focus were able to fill in a lot of those missing smaller components with new discoveries. Coming from multiple individuals, the hip bones are long and hollow, with a hip socket offset rather than centered. The bones of the frogs show how tiny they were just a bit over half an inch long. The Chinle frog could fit on the end of your finger, Dr. Stocker said. Even though the fossils are part of the Chinle frog family, they are not yet naming the specific fossils. We refrain from naming this Chinle frog because we are continuing to process microvertebrate matrix that will likely yield additional skull and postcranial material that has the potential to be even more informative, Dr. Stocker said. The Chinle frog shares more features with living frogs and Prosalirus, an Early Jurassic frog found in sediments from the present day Navajo Nation, than to Triadobatrachus, an Early Triassic frog found in modern day Madagascar in Africa. These are the oldest frogs from near the equator, Dr. Stocker said. The oldest frogs overall are roughly 250 million years old from Madagascar and Poland, but those specimens are from higher latitudes and not equatorial. Now we know that tiny frogs were present approximately 215 million years ago from North America, we may be able to find other members of the modern vertebrate communities in the Triassic period, said team member Dr. Sterling Nesbitt, also from the Department of Geosciences at Virginia Tech.

The discovery is described in the journal Communications Biology. Medium sized, primitive tyrannosaurs have been found in North America dating from the Jurassic period around 150 million years ago. By the Cretaceous period 81 million years ago North American tyrannosaurs had become the enormous, iconic apex predators we know and love. The fossil record between these time periods has been a blank slate, preventing paleontologists from piecing together the story behind the ascent of tyrannosaurs in North America. When and how quickly tyrannosaurs went from wallflower to prom king has been vexing paleontologists for a long time, said Dr. Lindsay Zanno, a paleontologist at North Carolina State University and head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Sciences. The only way to attack this problem was to get out there and find more data on these rare animals. The newly discovered tyrannosaur, named Moros intrepidus, lived about 96 million years ago in the lush, deltaic environment of what is now Utah. It is the oldest Cretaceous tyrannosaur species yet discovered in North America, narrowing a 70 million year gap in the fossil record of tyrannosauroid dinosaurs on the continent. With a lethal combination of bone crunching bite forces, stereoscopic vision, rapid growth rates, and colossal size, tyrant dinosaurs reigned uncontested for 15 million years leading up to the end Cretaceous extinction  but it wasnt always that way, Dr. Zanno said. Early in their evolution, tyrannosaurs hunted in the shadows of archaic lineages such as allosaurs that were already established at the top of the food chain. With a 3.9 foot 1.2 m length and 78 kg mass, Moros intrepidus ranks among the smallest Cretaceous tyrannosauroids. Dr. Zanno and colleagues estimate that the individual was over seven years old when it died, and that it was nearly full grown. Moros intrepidus was lightweight and exceptionally fast, Dr. Zanno said. These adaptations, together with advanced sensory capabilities, are the mark of a formidable predator. It could easily have run down prey, while avoiding confrontation with the top predators of the day. The bones of the new tyrannosaur also revealed the origin of T. rexs lineage on the North American continent. When the scientists placed Moros intrepidus within the family tree of tyrannosaurs they discovered that its closest relatives were from Asia. T. rex and its famous contemporaries such as Triceratops may be among our most beloved cultural icons, but we owe their existence to their intrepid ancestors who migrated here from Asia at least 30 million years prior, Dr. Zanno said. Moros intrepidus signals the establishment of the iconic Late Cretaceous ecosystems of North America.

The new marsupial, named Unnuakomys hutchisoni, is a member of Metatheria, a group within mammals that includes modern day marsupials and their fossil relatives. The opossum like critter roamed the Earth approximately 69 million years ago. It rubbed elbows with dinosaurs on a land mass that was, at the time, located far above the Arctic Circle. The ancient creature\u00a0was about the size of a house mouse, probably munched on insects, and may have lived underground. Despite an estimated weight of less than an ounce, this itty bitty animal was probably pretty hardy, said Dr. Jaelyn Eberle, curator of fossil vertebrates at the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History. It would have needed to survive 120 days of darkness in the winter and temperatures that averaged just 42 degrees Fahrenheit about 6 degrees Celsius. These guys must have been adapted to darkness because they spent a lot of time in it. Over 60 specimens of Unnuakomys hutchisoni teeth and jaws were collected from the Cretaceous deposits of the Prince Creek Formation cropping out along the Colville River on the North Slope of Alaska. The discovery paints a more detailed picture of the flora and fauna that once thrived in what is now the North Slope of Alaska  a region that, in the age of dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex, was home to species not seen anywhere else on Earth, Dr. Eberle said. This new marsupial is an exciting addition to the growing list of new species of dinosaurs and other animals that we are describing from northern Alaska as part of a bigger project to reveal ancient Arctic ecosystems, said Dr. Patrick Druckenmiller, a researcher at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. The discovery is reported in a paper in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. "}, {"title": " Extraordinary Diversity on Land Is Not a Recent Phenomenon, Says New Study", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Feb 20, 2019", "doc": "According to new research published in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution, land animal diversity has been similar for at least the last 60 million years, since soon after the extinction of the dinosaurs. Our work provides an example of the combined power of the fossil record and modern statistical approaches to answer major questions about the origins of modern biodiversity, said University of Birminghams Professor Richard Butler, senior author of the study. By understanding how biodiversity has changed in the past, we may be able to better understand the likely long term impact of the current biodiversity crisis. Previously, many scientists have argued that diversity increased steadily through geological time, which would mean that biodiversity today is much greater than it was tens of millions of years ago. But building an accurate picture of how land diversity was assembled is challenging because the fossil record generally becomes less complete further back in time. Professor Butler and colleagues examined how the diversity of land vertebrate species living in local ecosystems also known as ecological communities changed over the last 375 million years. The researchers analyzed nearly 30,000 fossil sites that have produced fossils of tetrapods, land vertebrate animals, such as mammals, birds, reptiles including dinosaurs and amphibians. They found that the average number of species within ecological communities of land vertebrates have not increased for tens of millions of years. Their results suggest that interactions between species, including competition for food and space, will limit the overall number of species that can co exist. Scientists often think that species diversity has been increasing unchecked over millions of years, and that diversity is much greater today than it was in the distant past, said study lead author Dr. Roger Close, also from the University of Birmingham. Our research shows that numbers of species within terrestrial communities are limited over long timescales, which contradicts the results of many experiments in modern ecological communities  now we need to understand why. One reason why diversity within ecological communities does not increase unchecked on long timescales could be because resources used by species, such as food and space, are finite. Competition for these resources may prevent new species invading ecosystems and lead to a balance between rates of speciation and extinction. After the origins of major groups of animals, or large scale ecological disruptions like mass extinctions, though, increases in diversity may happen abruptly  on geological, if not human timescales  and are again followed by long periods where no increases occur. Contrary to what you might expect, the largest increase in diversity within land vertebrate communities came after the mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs, 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period, Dr. Close said. Within just a few million years, local diversity had increased to two or three times that of pre extinction levels  driven primarily by the spectacular success of modern mammals. "}, {"title": " Multicellular Life Began 1.5 Billion Years Earlier than Thought", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Feb 19, 2019", "doc": "Approximately 2.1 billion year old fossilized tracks discovered in Gabon suggest the existence of a cluster of single cells that came together to form a slug like multicellular organism that moved through the mud in search of a more favorable environment. The preservation of fossilized tracks, or trace fossils, suggests that multicellular organisms that could move around to reach food resources may already have existed 2.1 billion years ago, more than 1.5 billion years older than previously thought, said University of Albertas Professor Kurt Konhauser, co author of the study. The trace fossils were found at the site of Franceville in the Haut Ogoou\u00e9 Province of Gabon, Africa. Preserved as tubular structures, they range from 6 mm across and 1.7 cm in length through the sediment layers and are likely the result of ancient mucus trails, left by multicellular life such as modern amoeboid cells in the search for food. A detailed 3D analysis using a non destructive X ray imagining technique, alongside geometrical and chemical dating, revealed that the fossils belong to an organism that likely spent most of its time in oxygenated waters, and was therefore oxygen dependent, the paleontologists said. Located next to these tubular structures were fossilized microbial biofilms which acted as grazing grounds for these organisms. It is plausible that the organisms behind this phenomenon moved in search of nutrients and oxygen that were produced by bacteria mats on the seafloor water interface, said co author Dr. Ernest Chi Fru, a researcher at Cardiff University. This sea floor environment was calm and shallow at the time, and rich in oxygen following the first wave of the Great Oxygenation Event, which began approximately 300 million years earlier, said first author Dr. Abderrazak El Albani, from CNRS and the University of Poitiers. The rise in ocean oxygen levels at this time could have played an important role by providing the energy needed for both the metabolism and development of these multicellular organisms, as well as for their movement.  The question arising from this research then is why do we go 1.5 billion years before we see similar features in the rock record. We dont see anything like this again until 585 million years ago, Professor Konhauser said. Some scientists speculate that this early emergence of complex life went extinct due to some environmental factor. Others suggest that similar fossilized traces may have existed but were not preserved, or simply gone unnoticed elsewhere. The broader community is right to be skeptical about the interpretation, Professor Konhauser said. However, one of the current paradigms relating to the evolution of multicellular organisms is oxygen availability, and 2.1 billion years ago there was no shortage of oxygen in shallow marine waters. The research appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The new dinosaur, named Mnyamawamtuka moyowamkia, is a member of Titanosauria, a diverse group of sauropod dinosaurs that includes species ranging from the largest known terrestrial vertebrates to dwarfs no bigger than elephants. Although titanosaurs became one of the most successful dinosaur groups before the infamous mass extinction capping the Age of Dinosaurs, their early evolutionary history remains obscure, and Mnyamawamtuka moyowamkia helps tell those beginnings, especially for their African side of the story, said team leader Dr. Eric Gorscak, a researcher at the Field Museum of Natural History and the Midwestern University. The partial skeleton of Mnyamawamtuka moyowamkia  including teeth, elements from all regions of the postcranial skeleton, portions of both limbs  was recovered from Cretaceous age rocks of the Galula Formation in southwest Tanzania. The wealth of information from the skeleton indicates it was distantly related to other known African titanosaurs, except for some interesting similarities with another dinosaur, Malawisaurus, from just across the Tanzania Malawi border, Dr. Gorscak said. Titanosaurs are best known from Cretaceous age rocks in South America, but other efforts by Dr. Gorscak and colleagues include new species discovered in Tanzania, Egypt, and other parts of the African continent that reveal a more complex picture of dinosaurian evolution on the planet. The discovery of dinosaurs like Mnyamawamtuka moyowamkia and others we have recently discovered is like doing a four dimensional connect the dots, said Ohio Universitys Professor Patrick OConnor. Each new discovery adds a bit more detail to the picture of what ecosystems on continental Africa were like during the Cretaceous, allowing us to assemble a more holistic view of biotic change in the past. This new dinosaur gives us important information about African fauna during a time of evolutionary change, said Dr. Judy Skog, a program director in NSFs Division of Earth Sciences, which funded the research. The discovery offers insights into paleogeography during the Cretaceous. Its also timely information about an animal with heart shaped tail bones during this week of Valentines Day.

Whats the most remarkable two of the newly described specimens feature reflective eyes that enabled their nighttime hunting. The newly discovered spiders lived in what is now Korea between 110 and 113 million years ago Cretaceous period. The Jinju shale preserved the fossils in a manner that highlighted the reflectivity of the tapetum, a feature that may have been missed had the spiders been preserved in amber instead, as is more typical. Because these spiders were preserved in strange slivery flecks on dark rock, what was immediately obvious was their rather large eyes brightly marked with crescentic features, said University of Kansas Professor Paul Selden. I realized this must have been the tapetum  thats a reflective structure in an inverted eye where light comes in and is reverted back into retina cells. This is unlike a straightforward eye where light goes through and doesnt have a reflective characteristic. Some contemporary spiders feature eyes with a tapetum, but this study is the first to describe the anatomical feature in a fossilized spider. In spiders, the ones you see with really big eyes are jumping spiders, but their eyes are regular eyes  whereas wolf spiders at nighttime, you see their eyes reflected in light like cats, Professor Selden said. So, night hunting predators tend to use this different kind of eye. This was the first time a tapetum had been in found in fossil. This tapetum was canoe shaped  it looks a bit like a Canadian canoe. That will help us place this group of spiders among other families. The description of the fossils increases the number of known spiders from the Jinju Formation from one to 11. Beyond the novelty of discovering the first fossilized spider tapetum, they informed the scientific understanding of Cretaceous biodiversity. This is an extinct family of spiders that were clearly very common in the Cretaceous and were occupying niches now occupied by jumping spiders that didnt evolve until later, Professor Selden said. But these spiders were doing things differently. Their eye structure is different from jumping spiders. Its nice to have exceptionally well preserved features of internal anatomy like eye structure. Its really not often you get something like that preserved in a fossil.

Named Gobiraptor minutus, the new dinosaur is thought to have lived between 80 and 70 million years ago Cretaceous period. The ancient creature was a member of Oviraptorosauria oviraptorosaurs, a diverse group of feathered, bird like dinosaurs from the Cretaceous of Asia and North America. Its incomplete skeleton, including both cranial and postcranial elements, was discovered in the Nemegt Formation of Altan Uul III, \u00d6mn\u00f6govi Province, Mongolia. The specimen was analyzed by a team of paleontologists from Seoul National University, the University of Cape Town, Chinas Institute of Geology and Mongolias Institute of Paleontology and Geology. Gobiraptor minutus can be distinguished from other oviraptorosaurs in having unusual thickened jaws, said Seoul National Universitys Dr. Yuong Nam Lee and colleagues. This unique morphology suggests that Gobiraptor minutus used a crushing feeding strategy, supporting previous hypotheses that oviraptorosaurs probably fed on hard food items such as eggs, seeds or hard shell mollusks. Histological analyses of Gobiraptor minutus femur revealed that the specimen likely belonged to a very young individual. The finding of a new oviraptorosaur species in the Nemegt Formation, which consists mostly of river and lake deposits, confirms that these dinosaurs were extremely well adapted to wet environments, the researchers said. Different dietary strategies may explain the wide taxonomic diversity and evolutionary success of this group in the region. The discovery was described in the journal PLoS ONE.

The ancient creature, named Antarctanax shackletoni, was a carnivore that hunted bugs, early mammal relatives, and amphibians. Its small, incomplete skeleton was collected from Graphite Peak in the Transantarctic Mountains during a 2010 2011 expedition. The fossil specimen consists of portions of the backbone, limbs and skull. Antarctanax shackletoni was an archosaur, an early relative of crocodiles and dinosaurs, said lead author Dr. Brandon Peecook, a paleontologist at Field Museum. On its own, it just looks a little like a lizard, but evolutionarily, its one of the first members of that big group. It tells us how dinosaurs and their closest relatives evolved and spread. The most interesting thing about Antarctanax shackletoni, though, is where it lived, and when. The more we find out about prehistoric Antarctica, the weirder it is. We thought that Antarctic animals would be similar to the ones that were living in southern Africa, since those landmasses were joined back then. But were finding that Antarcticas wildlife is surprisingly unique, Dr. Peecook said. About two million years before Antarctanax shackletoni lived Earth underwent its biggest ever mass extinction event  the end Permian mass extinction. Climate change, caused by volcanic eruptions, killed 90 of all animal life. The years immediately after that extinction event were an evolutionary free for all  with the slate wiped clean by the mass extinction, new groups of animals vied to fill the gaps. The archosaurs, including dinosaurs, were one of the groups that experienced enormous growth. Before the mass extinction, archosaurs were only found around the equator, but after it, they were everywhere, Dr. Peecook said. And Antarctica had a combination of these brand new animals and stragglers of animals that were already extinct in most places  what paleontologists call dead clades walking. Youve got tomorrows animals and yesterdays animals, cohabiting in a cool place. The discovery of Antarctanax shackletoni bolsters the idea that Antarctica was a place of rapid evolution and diversification after the end Permian mass extinction. The more different kinds of animals we find, the more we learn about the pattern of archosaurs taking over after the mass extinction, Dr. Peecook said. Antarctica is one of those places on Earth, like the bottom of the sea, where were still in the very early stages of exploration. Antarctanax shackletoni is our little part of discovering the history of Antarctica. Fossil exploration in Antarctica is really difficult, given all of the logistics involved.

Eretmorhipis carrolldongi was previously known only from partial fossils without a head, said University of California, Davis Professor Ryosuke Motani. This is a very strange animal. When I started thinking about the biology I was really puzzled. Professor Motani and colleagues analyzed two nearly complete specimens of Eretmorhipis carrolldongi from Yuanan County, China. The two fossils show the reptiles skull had bones that would have supported a bill of cartilage. Like the modern platypus Ornithorhynchus anatinus, there is a large hole in the bones in the middle of the bill. In the platypus, the bill is filled with receptors that allow it to hunt by touch in muddy streams. In the early Triassic, the area was covered by a shallow sea, about a meter deep, over a carbonate platform extending for hundreds of miles. The fossils of Eretmorhipis carrolldongi were found at what were deeper holes, or lagoons, in the platform. There are no fossils to show what the ancient reptile ate, but it likely fed on shrimp, worms and other small invertebrates. Its long, bony body means that Eretmorhipis carrolldongi was probably a poor swimmer, Professor Motani said. It wouldnt survive in the modern world, but it didnt have any rivals at the time. Related to the dolphin like ichthyosaurs, Eretmorhipis carrolldongi evolved in a world devastated by the mass extinction event at the end of the Permian era. The fossil provides more evidence of rapid evolution occurring during the early Triassic, Professor Motani said. The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Named Galagadon nordquistae, the newly discovered shark species once swam in the Cretaceous rivers of what is now South Dakota. It was a small freshwater shark 12 to 18 inches, or 30.5 45.7 cm, long, related to modern day carpet sharks such as the whiskered wobbegong shark. Its tiny teeth  each one measuring less than a millimeter across  were discovered in the sediment left behind when paleontologists uncovered the bones of Sue, currently the most complete T. rex specimen ever described. The more we discover about the Cretaceous period just before the non bird dinosaurs went extinct, the more fantastic that world becomes, said Dr. Terry Gates, lecturer at North Carolina State University and research affiliate with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. It may seem odd today, but about 67 million years ago, what is now South Dakota was covered in forests, swamps and winding rivers. This shark lived at the same time as Sue the T. rex, it was part of the same world, said Dr. Pete Makovicky, curator of dinosaurs at the Field Museum. Most of its body wasnt preserved, because sharks skeletons are made of cartilage, but we were able to find its tiny fossilized teeth. Galagadon nordquistae was not swooping in to prey on T. rex, Triceratops, or any other dinosaurs that happened into its streams. This shark had teeth that were good for catching small fish or crushing snails and crawdads, Dr. Gates added. It amazes me that we can find microscopic shark teeth sitting right beside the bones of the largest predators of all time. These teeth are the size of a sand grain. Without a microscope youd just throw them away. The study also reflects the importance of learning about fossils beyond big, flashy dinosaurs. Every species in an ecosystem plays a supporting role, keeping the whole network together, Dr. Gates said. There is no way for us to understand what changed in the ecosystem during the time of the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous without knowing all the wonderful species that existed before. Most people, when they think of fossils, think of big huge dinosaur bones, but in the dirt, there are the bones of tiny animals, said Field Museum volunteer Karen Nordquist. When you get those bones and identify them, you get an idea of the whole environment  everything that lived with the big dinosaurs. You learn so much from microsorting.

Apex predators live at the top of an ecological pyramid, preying on animals in the pyramid below and normally immune from predation themselves. They are often, but not always, the largest animals of their kind. The living killer whale Orcinus orca, about 20 to 26 feet 6 8 m in length, is an apex predator in modern world oceans. They feed on a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate animals including squids, sharks, bony fishes, turtles, seabirds, and other marine mammals. Basilosaurus isis, an archaic whale that lived about 38 34 million years ago late Eocene epoch, had a broad marine distribution at a time when few modern whales existed. In a new study, Dr. Manja Voss of the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Berlin in Germany and co authors examined the 50 foot 15 m long specimen of Basilosaurus isis from the Wadi Al Hitan Valley of Whales site in Cairo, Egypt. This site was once a shallow sea during the Eocene period and is remarkable for its wealth of marine fossils. While excavating the specimen, the paleontologists also found the remains of sharks, large bony fish, and, most numerously, bones from Dorudon atrox, a smaller species of ancient whale. The skeleton of Basilosaurus isis was distinct from other skeletons in the cluster, containing pointed the specimens incisors and sharp cheek teeth as well as bones. Most of the fish, and the remains of Dorudon atrox showed signs of breakage and bite marks, were fragmented, and tended to be clustered within the body cavity of the Basilosaurus isis specimen. One hypothesis to explain the clustering of these remains was that Dorudon atrox had scavenged the Basilosaurus isis carcass and fish, the researchers said. However, the Dorudon atrox specimens were juveniles, capable only of drinking mothers milk. Bite marks on prey skulls also indicated predation rather than scavenging, since predators commonly target the head. Basilosaurus isis was a top predator which ate its prey live, rather than by scavenging, they said. The remains of fish and juvenile Dorudon atrox in the cluster are remnants of previous Basilosaurus isis meals, while the teeth of sharks indicate postmortem scavenging. The Wadi Al Hitan site was a whale calving site for prey whale Dorudon atrox, making it a hunting site for top predator Basilosaurus isis during the late Eocene.

The newfound species, named Klobiodon rochei, belongs to an ancient order of flying creatures known as pterosaurs. The winged reptile lived approximately 167 million years ago Middle Jurassic epoch and had a wingspan of 6.5 feet 2 m. Its fossilized remains came from the Taynton Limestone Formation of Stonesfield, Oxfordshire, England. Only the lower jaw of Klobiodon rochei is known, but it has a unique dental configuration that allows it to be distinguished from other pterosaurs, said University of Portsmouth paleontologists Michael OSullivan and David Martill. Klobiodon rochei had huge, fang like teeth  up to 1 inch 2.6 cm long at a time when few pterosaurs had any teeth. It was likely a gull or tern like creature  a coastal flier that caught fish and squid using its enormous teeth, swallowing them whole, the researchers said. Its large fangs would have meshed together to form a toothy cage, from which little could escape once Klobiodon rochei had gotten a hold of it. Klobiodon rochei and other Stonesfield pterosaurs lived alongside one of the most famous and important dinosaurs in the world, the predatory Megalosaurus, the first dinosaur ever scientifically described. But as global sea levels were higher, and the world was much warmer, their Jurassic Britain was a series of large tropical islands. The discovery was announced in a paper that recently appeared in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica.

Named Nanjinganthus dendrostyla, the newly identified plant species dates back to more than 174 million years ago Early Jurassic epoch, making it the oldest known record of an angiosperm by almost 50 million years. From oranges to apples, angiosperms produce most of the fruits and vegetables that we can see on display in a supermarket. While we may take little notice of the poppy fields and plum blossoms around us, how flowers came to be has been an intensely debated mystery. The current understanding, which is mainly based on previously available fossils, is that flowers appeared about 125 million years ago in the Cretaceous period. But not everybody agrees that this is the case. Genetic analyses, for example, suggest that flowering plants are much more ancient. Another intriguing element is that flowers seemed to have arisen during the Cretaceous out of nowhere. Researchers were not certain where and how flowers came into existence because it seems that many flowers just popped up in the Cretaceous from nowhere, said study first author Dr. Qiang Fu, a researcher at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, China. Studying fossil flowers, especially those from earlier geologic periods, is the only reliable way to get an answer to these questions. Dr. Fu and co authors studied 264 specimens of 198 individual flowers preserved on 34 rock slabs from the South Xiangshan Formation, an outcrop of rocks in the Nanjing region of China renowned for bearing fossils from the Early Jurassic epoch. The abundance of fossil samples used in the study allowed the team to dissect some of them and study them with sophisticated microscopy, providing high resolution pictures of the flowers from different angles and magnifications. The scientists then used this detailed information about the shape and structure of the different fossil flowers to reconstruct the features of Nanjinganthus dendrostyla. The key feature of an angiosperm is angio ovuly  the presence of fully enclosed ovules, which are precursors of seeds before pollination. Nanjinganthus dendrostyla was found to have a cup form receptacle and ovarian roof that together enclose the ovulesseeds. This was a crucial discovery, because the presence of this feature confirmed the flowers status as an angiosperm. The origin of angiosperms has long been an academic headache for many botanists, said study senior author Professor Xin Wang, from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, China. Our discovery has moved the botany field forward and will allow a better understanding of angiosperms, which in turn will enhance our ability to efficiently use and look after our planets plant based resources.

In the Late Cretaceous epoch, North America was divided by a giant waterway called the Western Interior Seaway. It was a biologically prolific region from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada. Some of the worlds best fossils from this time are found here, including the Smoky Hill Chalk region of Kansas, where the newly described fossil was found. The specimen was excavated in the 1960s and kept in the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum before University of Southern Californias Dr. Michael Habib and colleagues plucked it from a display for further study. The scientists were intrigued by the embedded shark tooth because of more than 1,100 specimens of Pteranodon, a large pterodactyloid pterosaur from the Late Cretaceous of North America, only seven or less than 1 show evidence of predator prey interaction. Pteranodons were masters of the sky. These gigantic flying reptiles abounded when dinosaurs walked the Earth. They ported a conspicuous crested skull, had a wingspan of 18 feet 5.5 m and weighed about 100 pounds 45 kg. They could travel long distances, land and take off in water and had a fancy for fish. But Cretaceous oceans were a dangerous place to linger. Under the waves lurked big, flesh eating reptiles and sharks. But which sea monster killed it? How did it happen? And why was the neck bone intact? First, the paleontologists had to rule out that the shark tooth, about 1 inch 2.5 cm long, wasnt randomly stuck to the Pteranodon vertebra perhaps had both been deposited in a prehistoric boneyard at the same time. They found that the tooth was stuck between ridges in the neck vertebrae, which was clear evidence of a bite. The tooth belonged to a large mackerel shark called Cretoxyrhina mantelli. This particular predator was large, fast and powerful, about 8 feet 2.4 m long and roughly comparable in appearance and behavior to todays great white shark, though its not closely related. Second, the team wondered why the evidence of attack was preserved at all. Typically, heavy shark bites utterly shattered pterosaur bones, leaving little trace. In this instance, the tooth just happened to get stuck on a particularly bony part of the neck, which led to the fortuitous fossil. Such a fossil discovery is so rare that this is the first documented occurrence of this shark species interacting with a pterosaur. Third, while the researchers may never know exactly what happened, its possible the attack occurred when the Pteranodon was most vulnerable, sprawled atop the water. While Pteranodon could land and take off on water, they were ungainly at sea and took considerable time to take off. Understanding the ecology of these animals is important to understanding life on Earth through time, Dr. Habib said. Are there sharks today that hunt seabirds? Yes, there are. Is that unique or have big sharks been hunting flying creatures for millions of years? The answer is yes, they have. We now know sharks were hunting flying animals as long ago as 80 million years.

The newly identified dinosaur belongs to Ceratosauria ceratosaurs, a group of large bodied theropod dinosaurs. Named Saltriovenator zanellai, it lived approximately 198 million years ago Early Jurassic epoch. With an estimated body length of 25 feet 7.5 m, it is the largest and most robust theropod from the Early Jurassic, pre dating the occurrence in theropods of a body mass approaching 1,000 kg by over 25 million years. The ancient creature is also the oldest known ceratosaur and is the first Jurassic dinosaur known from Italy. The partial skeleton of Saltriovenator zanellai was accidentally discovered in 1996 by Angelo Zanella, fossil amateur and collaborator of the Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano, in a huge quarry located in the Alpine foothills, at the Swiss Italian border near Saltrio, less than 50 miles 80 km north of Milan, Varese Province, Lombardy. Many bones of the dinosaur bear feeding marks by marine invertebrates, which represent the first case on its remains and indicate that its carcass floated in a marine basin and then sunk, remaining on the sea bottom for quite a long time before burial. Although fragmentary, Saltriovenator zanellai shows a mosaic of ancestral and advanced anatomical features, respectively seen in the four fingered dilophosaurids and ceratosaurs, and the three fingered tetanuran theropods, such as allosaurids, said Dr. Cristiano Dal Sasso, a paleontologist at the Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano. Paleohistological analysis indicates that Saltriovenator zanellai was a still growing subadult individual, therefore its estimated size is all the more remarkable, in the context of the Early Jurassic epoch, added Dr. Simone Maganuco, also from the Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano. The evolutionary arms race between stockier predatory and giant herbivorous dinosaurs, involving progressively larger species, had already begun 200 million of years ago. The grasping hand of Saltriovenator zanellai fills a key gap in the theropod evolutionary tree predatory dinosaurs progressively lost the pinky and ring fingers, and acquired the three fingered hand which is the precursor of the avian wing, said Dr. Andrea Cau, a researcher at the Museo Geologico Giovanni Capellini.

University of Cambridge researchers Anthony Shillito and Neil Davies discovered a collection of 85 dinosaur footprints in the Lee Ness Sandstone of the Ashdown Formation, in a near continuous 3.7 mile 6 km long coastal cliff section extending between Fairlight Cove and Hastings in East Sussex, England. The footprints were left by herbivorous dinosaurs, including Iguanodon, Ankylosaurus, a species of stegosaur, and possible examples from the sauropod group which included Diplodocus and Brontosaurus as well as carnivorous theropods. They range in size from less than 0.8 inches 2 cm to over 23 inches 60 cm across and are so well preserved that fine detail of skin, scales and claws is easily visible. Whole body fossils of dinosaurs are incredibly rare, Shillito said. Usually you only get small pieces, which dont tell you a lot about how that dinosaur may have lived. A collection of footprints like this helps you fill in some of the gaps and infer things about which dinosaurs were living in the same place at the same time. In the Cretaceous period, the area where the footprints were found was likely near a water source, and in addition to the footprints, a number of fossilized plants and invertebrates were also found. To preserve footprints, you need the right type of environment, Dr. Davies said. The ground needs to be sticky enough so that the footprint leaves a mark, but not so wet that it gets washed away. You need that balance in order to capture and preserve them. As well as the large abundance and diversity of these prints, we also see absolutely incredible detail, Shillito added. You can clearly see the texture of the skin and scales, as well as four toed claw marks, which are extremely rare. You can get some idea about which dinosaurs made them from the shape of the footprints  comparing them with what we know about dinosaur feet from other fossils lets you identify the important similarities. When you also look at footprints from other locations you can start to piece together which species were the key players.

"}, {"title": " Pterosaurs Had Four Types of Feathers, New Study Shows", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Dec 18, 2018", "doc": "Pterosaurs lived side by side with dinosaurs, some 230 to 66 million years ago. They were the first vertebrates to achieve true flapping flight, but in the absence of living species, many questions concerning their biology and lifestyle remain unresolved. It has long been known that they had some sort of furry covering called pycnofibers, and it was presumed that it was fundamentally different to feathers of dinosaurs and birds. An analysis of two pterosaur specimens with well preserved pycnofibers shows that these flying reptiles had at least four types of feathers simple filaments hairs, bundles of filaments, filaments with a tuft halfway down and down feathers. Birds have two types of advanced feathers used in flight and for body smoothing, the contour feathers with a hollow quill and barbs down both sides. These are found only in birds and the theropod dinosaurs close to bird origins. But the other feather types of modern birds include monofilaments and down feathers, and these are seen much more widely across dinosaurs and pterosaurs. Our discovery has amazing implications for our understanding of the origin of feathers, but also for a major time of revolution of life on land, said University of Bristols Professor Mike Benton, senior author of the study. When feathers arose, about 250 million years ago, life was recovering from the devastating end Permian mass extinction. Professor Benton and co authors studied two pterosaur specimens from the Middle Late Jurassic Yanliao Biota around 165160 million years ago\u00a0in Inner Mongolia, China, and found many examples of all four types of feathers. We were able to explore every corner of the specimens using high powered microscopes, and we found many examples of all four feathers, said Nanjing University paleontologist Dr. Zixiao Yang, first author of the study. Some critics have suggested that actually there is only one simple type of pycnofiber, but our studies show the different feather types are real, said co author Dr. Maria McNamara, a researcher at University College Cork. We focused on clear areas where the feathers did not overlap and where we could see their structure clearly. They even show fine details of melanosomes, which may have given the fluffy feathers a ginger color. We ran some evolutionary analyses and they showed clearly that the pterosaur pycnofibers are feathers, just like those seen in modern birds and across various dinosaur groups, Professor Benton said. Despite careful searching, we couldnt find any anatomical evidence that the four pycnofiber types are in any way different from the feathers of birds and dinosaurs. Therefore, because they are the same, they must share an evolutionary origin, and that was about 250 million years ago, long before the origin of birds. The study was published in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution.

Recent papers revealing ancient seabed deposits of a radioactive isotope of iron called iron 60 provided strong evidence of the timing and distance of supernovae, said Professor Melott, lead author of a paper published in the journal Astrobiology. Because iron 60 is radioactive, if it was formed with the Earth it would be long gone by now. So, it had to have been rained down on us. Theres some debate about whether there was only one supernova really nearby or a whole chain of them. I kind of favor a combo of the two  a big chain with one that was unusually powerful and close. Other evidence for a series of supernovae is found in the very architecture of the local Universe. We have the Local Bubble in the interstellar medium. Were right on its edge. Its a giant region about 300 light years long, Professor Melott said. Its basically very hot, very low density gas  nearly all the gas clouds have been swept out of it. The best way to manufacture a bubble like that is a whole bunch of supernovae blows it bigger and bigger, and that seems to fit well with idea of a chain. Whether or not there was one supernova or a series of them, the supernova energy that spread layers of iron 60 all over the world also caused penetrating particles called muons to shower Earth, causing cancers and mutations  especially to larger animals. Muons are very penetrating. Even normally, there are lots of them passing through us. Nearly all of them pass through harmlessly, yet about one fifth of our radiation dose comes by muons. But when this wave of cosmic rays hits, multiply those muons by a few hundred, Professor Melott said. Only a small faction of them will interact in any way, but when the number is so large and their energy so high, you get increased mutations and cancer  these would be the main biological effects. We estimated the cancer rate would go up about 50 for something the size of a human  and the bigger you are, the worse it is. For an elephant or a whale, the radiation dose goes way up. The end Pliocene extinction was concentrated in coastal waters, where larger organisms would catch a greater radiation dose from the muons. Damage from muons would extend down hundreds of yards into ocean waters, becoming less severe at greater depths, the researchers said. High energy muons can reach deeper in the oceans being the more relevant agent of biological damage as depth increases. Indeed, large and fierce marine animals inhabiting shallower waters may have been doomed by the supernova radiation. One of the extinctions that happened 2.6 million years ago was Carcharocles megalodon, the largest shark that ever lived on Earth. Carcharocles megalodon was about the size of a school bus, Professor Melott said. This species just disappeared about that time. So, we can speculate it might have something to do with the muons. Basically, the bigger the creature is the bigger the increase in radiation would have been.

Nearly 96 of all marine species were wiped out during the extinction even, followed by millions of years when life had to multiply and diversify once more. According to a new study published in the journal Science, the extinction in the oceans was caused by global warming that left marine animals unable to breathe as temperatures rose and the metabolism of the animals sped up, the warmer waters could not hold enough oxygen for them to survive. This is the first time that we have made a mechanistic prediction about what caused the extinction that can be directly tested with the fossil record, which then allows us to make predictions about the causes of extinction in the future, said study lead author Justin Penn, a doctoral student at the University of Washington. Penn and his colleagues from the University of Washington and Stanford University investigated the roles of rapid greenhouse warming and the accompanying loss of oxygen in the ocean, the two best supported aspects of end Permian environmental change. They simulated the dynamics of the ancient extinction using an Earth system model coupled with data representing a diverse collection of living species to simulate the effects of end Permian ocean warming and deoxidation on habitat loss and animal survival. The results revealed distinct patterns of extinction  animals that lived in higher latitudes were more prone to extinction. As waters warmed and oxygen became scarce, their low tolerance for hypoxic environments meant they had nowhere to run. Tropical marine animals, pre adapted to low oxygen and high temperatures, were better equipped to survive the environmental changes. The signature of that kill mechanism, climate warming and oxygen loss, is this geographic pattern thats predicted by the model and then discovered in the fossils, Penn said. The agreement between the two indicates this mechanism of climate warming and oxygen loss was a primary cause of the extinction. According to the team, the situation in the late Permian  increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that create warmer temperatures on Earth  is similar to today. Under a business as usual emissions scenarios, by 2100 warming in the upper ocean will have approached 20 of warming in the late Permian, and by the year 2300 it will reach between 35 and 50, Penn said. This study highlights the potential for a mass extinction arising from a similar mechanism under anthropogenic climate change.

The fossil is so well preserved that its soft tissues retain some of their original flexibility. Molecular and microstructural analyses of the fossil have revealed that this creature was warm blooded, had insulating blubber and used its coloration as camouflage from predators. Ichthyosaurs are interesting because they have many traits in common with dolphins, but are not at all closely related to those sea dwelling mammals, said senior author Professor Mary Schweitzer, from the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and Lund University. We arent exactly sure of their biology either. They have many features in common with living marine reptiles like sea turtles, but we know from the fossil record that they gave live birth, which is associated with warm bloodedness. This study reveals some of those biological mysteries. In the study, Professor Schweitzer and co authors analyzed a Stenopterygius fossil from the Holzmaden quarry in Germany. The ichthyosaur lived in what is today southern Germany some 180 million years ago. At that time, the approximately 6.5 foot 2 m long reptile swam in a vast ocean that was then covering large parts of present day Europe. Both the body outline and remnants of internal organs are clearly visible, said lead author Dr. Johan Lindgren, of Lund University. Remarkably, the fossil is so well preserved that it is possible to observe individual cellular layers within its skin. The paleontologists identified cell like microstructures that held pigment organelles within the fossils skin, as well as traces of an internal organ thought to be the liver. They observed material chemically consistent with vertebrate blubber, which is only found in animals capable of maintaining body temperatures independent of ambient conditions. They also extracted soft tissues from the samples and performed multiple, high resolution immunohistochemical analyses. We developed a panel of antibodies that we applied to all of the samples, and saw differential binding, meaning the antibodies for a particular protein  like keratin or hemoglobin  only bound to particular areas, Professor Schweitzer said. This demonstrates the specificity of these antibodies and is strong evidence that different proteins persist in different tissues. You wouldnt expect to find keratin in the liver, for example, but you would expect hemoglobin. And thats what we saw in the responses of these samples to different antibodies and other chemical tools. The team also found chemical evidence for subcutaneous blubber. This is the first direct, chemical evidence for warm bloodedness in an ichthyosaur, because blubber is a feature of warm blooded animals, Professor Schweitzer said. Taken together, the findings indicate that Stenopterygius ichthyosaurs had skin similar to that of a whale, and coloration similar to many living marine animals  dark on top and lighter on the bottom  which would provide camouflage from predators, like pterosaurs from above, or pliosaurs from below. Both morphologically and chemically, we found that although Stenopterygius would be loosely considered reptiles, they lost the scaly skin associated with these animals  just as the modern leatherback sea turtle has, Professor Schweitzer said. Losing the scales reduces drag and increases maneuverability underwater. The research was published in the journal Nature.

The new Australian dinosaur, named Weewarrasaurus pobeni, was about the size of a large dog. The ancient creature was an ornithopod dinosaur, part of a group of small plant eating species that moved around on two legs and that were particularly abundant on the Cretaceous floodplains of eastern Australia. A fragment of the jawbone of Weewarrasaurus pobeni was found deep in an underground mine at the Wee Warra locality close to the GrawinGlengarry opal fields, approximately 25 miles 40 km southwest of Lightning Ridge, central northern New South Wales. The fossil was analyzed by a team of paleontologists from the Australian Opal Centre and the Universities of New England and Queensland. Like all fossils from the Lightning Ridge opal mines, the lower jaw of Weewarrasaurus pobeni is preserved in opal, said University of New Englands Dr. Phil Bell and co authors. Lightning Ridge is the only place in the world where dinosaur bones routinely turn to opal. Lightning Ridge is a world class fossil resource because it preserves a unique suite of Cretaceous fauna. If these fossils were in surface rock, like those found in China and Mongolia, it would be an absolute treasure trove, Dr. Bell said. Unfortunately, the fossil remnants we see are almost always part of mining spoil, because they sit in rock strata that lie up to 100 feet 30 m underground. The mining process breaks the fossils into fragments  but on the other hand, we would never get to see even those fragments if it wasnt for mining. The jawbone of Weewarrasaurus pobeni is a supremely rare and unlikely discovery, said Dr. Jenni Brammall, manager of the Australian Opal Centre.

The researchers found that this toothless whale, named Maiabalaena nesbittae, had no baleen, showing a surprising intermediary step between the baleen whales that live today and their toothed ancestors. Maiabalaena nesbittae represents a surprising intermediate stage between modern filter feeding whales and their toothed ancestors. Instead, the 15 foot 4.6 m long ancient whale was a suction feeder, said team leader Dr. Carlos Mauricio Peredo, a paleontologist at George Mason University and the National Museum of Natural History. The findings suggest that early whales lost their teeth before the evolutionary origin of comb like baleen. Baleen works much like a sieve, allowing modern baleen whales to filter huge volumes of small prey from seawater in quantities sufficient to support their massive bodies. Filter feeding in baleen whales represents an innovation without precedent among any other mammals, and its origin has been a long standing question since Darwin. At 33 million years old, Maiabalaena nesbittae dates back to a period of massive geological change. The age and geographic location of Maiabalaena nesbittae suggested to the scientists that it would shed new light on whale evolutionary history. Their first surprise was the discovery that the species lacked teeth, making it the oldest toothless whale known to science. But, the real surprise came when they realized that the fossilized specimen showed no evidence for baleen either. A living baleen whale has a big, broad roof in its mouth, and its also thickened to create attachment sites for the baleen, Dr. Peredo said. Maiabalaena nesbittae does not. We can pretty conclusively tell you this fossil species didnt have teeth, and it is more likely than not that it didnt have baleen either. Based on Maiabalaena nesbittaes relationship to other whales, the findings suggest that whales lost teeth first. Baleen only came later. The results also help to shape paleontologists understanding of the evolutionary origin of baleen, which remains one of the most enigmatic and unique structures in mammals. While Maiabalaena nesbittae would not have been able to chew or to filter feed, muscle attachments on the bones of its throat indicate it likely had strong cheeks and a retractable tongue. These traits would have enabled it to suck water into its mouth, taking up fish and small squid in the process, the researchers said. The ability to suction feed would have rendered teeth, whose development requires a lot of energy to grow, unnecessary. The loss of teeth, then, appears to have set the evolutionary stage for the baleen, which we estimate arose about 5 to 7 million years later. The research is published in the journal Current Biology.

Now improved dating of fossils suggests that the species survived in Eastern Europe and Central Asia until at least 39,000 years ago, overlapping in time with the existence of early modern humans. Today there are just five surviving rhinoceros species, although in the past there have been as many as 250 species at different times. Weighing up to 3.5 tons, Elasmotherium sibericum  also known as the Siberian unicorn, due to its extraordinary single horn  was undoubtedly one of the most impressive. It has long been assumed that this ancient creature went extinct well before the Ice Age. However, a new study challenges the date of this species demise. This megafaunal extinction event didnt really get going until about 40,000 years ago, said study senior author Professor Adrian Lister, a researcher in the Department of Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museum, London, UK. So Elasmotherium sibericum with its apparent extinction date of 100,000 years ago or more has not been considered as part of that same event. We dated a few specimens and to our surprise they came in at less than 40,000 years old. The radiocarbon dating results show that Elasmotherium sibericum survived until at least 39,000 years ago, and possibly as late as 35,000 years ago. Further study revealed more about the giant rhinoceros biology and possible behavior. Professor Lister and co authors studied the stable isotope ratios in the species teeth, which involved looking at the levels of different carbon and nitrogen isotopes and then comparing them to different plants, allowing them to determine what the animals were eating. The results confirm that Elasmotherium sibericum was most likely grazing on tough, dry grasses. Elasmotherium sibericums final days were shared with early modern humans and Neanderthals, the researchers said. It is, however, unlikely that the presence of humans was the cause of extinction. Instead it is more probable that dramatic fluctuations in climate during this time period, coupled with the specialized grazing lifestyle and the rhinos naturally low population numbers pushed the species to the edge. The researchers were also able to extract DNA from some of the fossil. This helped to settle a debate about where Elasmotherium sibericum, along with all other members of the genus Elasmotherium, fit on the rhino evolutionary tree. The ancient group split from the modern group of rhinos roughly 43 million years ago making Elasmotherium sibericum the last species of a highly distinctive and ancient linage, the study authors said.

Previously, Triassic dicynodonts were characterized only with sprawling forelimbs the gait of reptiles. The find of Lisowicia bojani shows that at least one dicynodont lineage also participated in the push for gigantism at the same time as the sauropodomorphs, but also suggests that their evolutionary history in the Late Triassic is poorly documented, the paleontologists said. This discovery changes our ideas about the latest history of dicynodonts, mammal Triassic relatives, Dr. Sulej said. It also raises far more questions about what really make them and dinosaurs so large. Dicynodonts were amazingly successful animals in the Middle and Late Triassic. Lisowicia bojani is the youngest dicynodont and the largest non dinosaurian terrestrial tetrapod from the Triassic, Dr. Niedzwiedzki added. Its natural to want to know how dicynodonts became so large.\u00a0Lisowicia bojani is hugely exciting because it blows holes in many of our classic ideas of Triassic mammal like reptiles. The research was published in the journal Science.

Dubbed Lavocatisaurus agrioensis, the new dinosaur is thought to have lived approximately 110 million years ago Cretaceous period. The creature was a type of sauropod, a group of huge plant eating dinosaurs that includes the largest animals ever to walk the Earth. One adult and two immature specimens of Lavocatisaurus agrioensis were recovered near the locality of Agrio del Medio, a small town in the central part of the province of Neuqu\u00e9n, Patagonia. We found most of the skull bones of Lavocatisaurus agrioensis the snout, the jaws, a lot of teeth, also the bones that define the orbit of the eyes for example and, in that way, we were able to do a very complete reconstruction, said Dr. Jos\u00e9 Luis Carballido, a paleontologist at the CONICET Egidio Feruglio Museum. In addition, parts of the neck, tail and back of this species were found. The paleontologists estimate that adult Lavocatisaurus agrioensis grew to about 39 feet long, while juveniles were around 20 23 feet 6 7 m long. The discovery was made in the center of the Argentinean province of Neuqu\u00e9n, Dr. Carballido said. At that site, 110 million years ago, the environment was very desert, with sporadic lagoons, so we were surprised to find the fossils there. Although it is estimated that this group of sauropods could have been adapted to move in rather arid environments, with low vegetation, with little humidity and little water, it is an environment in which one would not be looking for fossils. The same aridity of the environment indicates that the fossil remains of these three individuals were not displaced and gathered next to a waterway, but that they moved in groups and died together. There is no way to know if there was kinship among the members of this group, so it will be left to the imagination to guess if it was a father or a mother with two of their children. The discovery is reported in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica.

According to an analysis of the fossil, published in the journal PeerJ, Late Cretaceous enantiornithines were the aerodynamic equals of the ancestors of todays birds, able to fly strongly and agilely. All birds evolved from feathered theropods  the two legged dinosaurs like T. rex  beginning about 150 million years ago, and developed into many lineages in the Cretaceous period, between 146 and 65 million years ago. But after the cataclysm that wiped out most of the dinosaurs, only one group of birds remained the ancestors of the birds we see today. Why did only one family survive the mass extinction? The newly discovered fossil from one of those extinct bird groups, enantiornithines, deepens that mystery. This particular bird, named Mirarce eatoni, is about 75 million years old  about 10 million years before the die off, said Dr. Jessie Atterholt, a researcher at the Western University of Health Sciences. One of the really interesting and mysterious things about enantiornithines is that we find them throughout the Cretaceous period, for roughly 100 million years of existence, and they were very successful. Mirarce eatoni is among the largest North American birds from the Cretaceous most were the size of chickadees or crows. The specimen was found in Kaiparowits Formation in the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in Garfield County, Utah, in 1992, and is the most complete enantiornithine collected in North America to date. Most birds from the Americas are from the Late Cretaceous and known only from a single foot bone, often the metatarsus. This fossil was almost complete, missing only its head, the paleontologists said. Mirarce eatonis breast bone or sternum, where flight muscles attach, is more deeply keeled than other enantiornithines, implying a larger muscle and stronger flight more similar to modern birds. The wishbone is more V shaped, like the wishbone of modern birds and unlike the U shaped wishbone of earlier avians and their dinosaur ancestors. The wishbone or furcula is flexible and stores energy released during the wing stroke. What is most exciting, however, are large patches on the forearm bones. These rough patches are quill knobs, and in modern birds they anchor the wing feathers to the skeleton to help strengthen them for active flight, Dr. Atterholt said. This is the first discovery of quill knobs in any enantiornithine bird, which tells us that Mirarce eatoni was a very strong flier. We know that birds in the early Cretaceous, about 115 to 130 million years ago, were capable of flight but probably not as well adapted for it as modern birds, Dr. Atterholt said. What this new fossil shows is that enantiornithines, though totally separate from modern birds, evolved some of the same adaptations for highly refined, advanced flight styles. If enantiornithines in the late Cretaceous were just as advanced as modern birds, however, why did they die out with the dinosaurs while the ancestors of modern birds did not? One recently proposed hypothesis argues that they were primarily forest dwellers, so that when forests went up in smoke after the asteroid strike that signaled the end of the Cretaceous period  and the end of non avian dinosaurs  the enantiornithines disappeared as well. I think it is a really interesting hypothesis and the best explanation I have heard so far, Dr. Atterholt said. But we need to do really rigorous studies of enantiornithines ecology, because right now that part of the puzzle is a little hand wavey.

The fossil trackway covers a boulder that rests along the Bright Angel Trail in Grand Canyon National Park. A recent rockfall along the Bright Angel Trail produced two blocks of fine grained quartz arenite from the Manakacha Formation, explained University of Nevadas Professor Stephen Rowland and San Diego State Universitys Dr. Mario Caputo. The two blocks display part and counterpart surfaces containing a conspicuous vertebrate trackway consisting of 28 tracks, preserved as impressions on one block and natural casts on the opposing block. The trackway extends about 3.3 feet 1 m across the width of the fallen blocks. The Bright Angel Trail trackway dates to the Carboniferous period when one massive supercontinent called Pangaea dominated the world, and is unusual for several reasons. Its the oldest trackway ever discovered in the Grand Canyon in an interval of rocks that nobody thought would have trackways in it, and theyre among the earliest reptile tracks on Earth, Professor Rowland said. My first impression was that it looked very bizarre because of the sideways motion, he added. It appeared that two animals were walking side by side. But you wouldnt expect two lizard like animals to be walking side by side. It didnt make any sense. Then I made detailed drawings, and began hypothesizing about the peculiar, line dancing gait left behind by the creature. One reason Ive proposed is that the animal was walking in a very strong wind, and the wind was blowing it sideways. Another possibility is that the slope was too steep, and the animal sidestepped as it climbed the sand dune. Or the animal was fighting with another creature, or engaged in a mating ritual. The Bright Angel Trail footprints could belong to a reptile species that has never yet been discovered. It absolutely could be that whoever was the trackmaker, his or her bones have never been recorded, Professor Rowland said.

This completely changes our understanding of how egg colors evolved, said Wiemann, a paleontologist in the Department of Geology  Geophysics at Yale University. For two centuries, ornithologists assumed that egg color appeared in modern birds eggs multiple times, independently. The egg colors of birds reflect characteristic preferences in nesting environments and brooding behaviors. Modern birds use only two pigments  blue green biliverdin and red brown protoporphyrin IX  to create all of the various egg colors, spots, and speckles. Wiemann and her colleagues from the American Museum of Natural History and the University of Bonn analyzed 18 fossil dinosaur eggshell samples from around the world, using non destructive laser microspectroscopy to test for the presence of the two eggshell pigments. They found the pigments in eggshells belonging to Eumaniraptoran dinosaurs, which include small, carnivorous dinosaurs such as Velociraptor. We infer that egg color co evolved with open nesting habits in dinosaurs, Wiemann explained. Once dinosaurs started to build open nests, exposure of the eggs to visually hunting predators and even nesting parasites favored the evolution of camouflaging egg colors, and individually recognizable patterns of spots and speckles. Colored eggs have been considered a unique bird characteristic for over a century, said co author Dr. Mark Norell, the Macaulay Curator of Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. Like feathers and wishbones, we now know that egg color evolved in their dinosaur predecessors long before birds appeared. The study is published in the journal Nature. "}, {"title": " Study: Elephant Birds were Nocturnal, Possibly Blind", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Nov 1, 2018", "doc": "The recently extinct Malagasy elephant birds included the largest birds ever discovered. Seven species are recognized across two genera, including the larger Aepyornis and the smaller, gracile Mullerornis. The neuroanatomy of these enigmatic birds is understudied but can shed light on their lifestyle. In a study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, researchers from the University of Texas at Austin examined the neuroanatomy of two elephant bird species, Aepyornis maximus and A. hildebrandti, and found that the part of the elephant bird brain that processed vision was tiny, a trait that indicates they were nocturnal and possibly blind. Elephant birds were large, flightless and lived in what is now Madagascar until a mixture of habitat loss and potential human meddling led to their demise between 500 and 1,000 years ago. Humans lived alongside, and even hunted, elephant birds for thousands of years, said lead author Christopher Torres, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Texas at Austin. But we still know practically nothing about their lives. We dont even really know exactly when or why they went extinct. Ornithologists had previously assumed that elephant birds were similar to other big, flightless birds, like emus and ostriches  both of which are active during the day and have good eyesight. But Torres and his colleague, University of Texas at Austins Professor Julia Clarke, revealed that elephant birds had distinctly different lifestyles through reconstructions of their brains. The researchers studied the skulls of two species of elephant birds Aepyornis maximus and A. hildebrandti. By using CT imaging data of the skulls, they were able to create digital brain reconstructions called endocasts. In addition to the elephant bird skulls, they also created endocasts for close relatives of the elephant bird, both living and extinct. In both elephant bird skulls, the optic lobe  a bundle of brain nerves that controls eyesight  was very small, with the structure almost absent in the larger species, Aepyornis maximus. The lobe had the most in common with that of the kiwi, a practically blind, chicken size denizen of New Zealand, which came as a total shock because of the kiwis poor vision and nocturnal behavior, Torres said. No one has ever suspected that elephant birds were nocturnal. The few studies that speculated on what their behavior was like explicitly assumed they were active during the day, he said. In addition to vision, the endocasts rendering of the olfactory bulb  the part of the brain that processes the sense of smell  helped shed light on the habitats where elephant birds lived. The larger Aepyornis maximus had a large olfactory bulb, a trait associated with forest dwelling. In contrast, the smaller Aepyornis hildebrandti had a smaller olfactory bulb, possibly indicating that it lived in grasslands. The smaller species also appears to have somewhat keener vision, which means it may have been more active at dusk than during the pitch black of night. Details like these not only tell us about what the lives of elephant birds were like, but also what life in general was like on Madagascar in the distant past, Professor Clarke said. As recently as 500 years ago, very nearly blind, giant flightless birds were crashing around the forests of Madagascar in the dark. No one ever expected that.

Only 12 specimens have ever been found and all are from the late Jurassic of Bavaria, Germany, dating back approximately 150 million years. Now, Dr. Martin Kundr\u00e1t from the University of Pavol Jozef \u0160af\u00e1rik and co authors have identified a new species of Archaeopteryx  named A. albersdoerferi  that is closer to modern birds in evolutionary terms. Using synchrotron microtomography, Dr. Kundr\u00e1t and colleagues examined one of 12 Archaeopteryx specimens, known as specimen number eight. This Archaeopteryx individual is physically much closer to a modern bird than it is to a reptile, the paleontologists said. Therefore, it is evolutionary distinctive and different enough to be described as a new species  Archaeopteryx albersdoerferi. Some of the differing skeletal characteristics of Archaeopteryx albersdoerferi include the fusion of cranial bones, different pectoral girdle chest and wing elements, and a reinforced configuration of carpals and metacarpals hand bones. These characteristics are seen more in modern flying birds and are not found in the older Archaeopteryx lithographica species, which more resembles reptiles and dinosaurs. Specimen number eight is the youngest of all the 12 known specimens by approximately half a million years. This age difference in comparison to the other specimens is a key factor in describing it as a new species. By digitally dissecting the fossil we found that this specimen differed from all of the others, said co author Dr. John Nudds, from the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Manchester. It possessed skeletal adaptations which would have resulted in much more efficient flight. In a nutshell we have discovered what Archaeopteryx lithographica evolved into  i.e. a more advanced bird, better adapted to flying  and we have described this as a new species of Archaeopteryx. This is the first time that numerous bones and teeth of Archaeopteryx were viewed from all aspects including exposure of their inner structure, Dr. Kundr\u00e1t said. The use of synchrotron microtomography was the only way to study the specimen as it is heavily compressed with many fragmented bones partly or completely hidden in limestone. Whenever a missing link is discovered, this merely creates two further missing links  what came before, and what came after, Dr. Nudds said. What came before was discovered in 1996 with the feathered dinosaurs in China. Our new species is what came after. It confirms Archaeopteryx as the first bird, and not just one of a number of feathered theropod dinosaurs, which some authors have suggested recently. You could say that it puts Archaeopteryx back on its perch as the first bird. The discovery is reported in the Historical Biology, an international journal of paleobiology.

Vanderbilt University paleontologist Dr. Larisa DeSantis and co authors addressed the question about the extinction of the marsupial lion by looking into the carnivores chemistry. By studying the chemical signature preserved within fossil teeth, they were able to determine that the animal hunted primarily in forests, rather than open habitats. This is supported by features of the skeleton that indicate it was an ambush hunter, relying on catching its prey unaware rather than running them down across an open landscape. The new data provide evidence that the marsupial lion was an ambush predator and relied on prey that occupied denser cover, Dr. DeSantis said. As the landscape became drier and forests less dense, these apex predators may have become less effective hunters and succumbed to extinction. The study of these ancient fossils provides us with cautionary lessons for the future climate change can impact even the fiercest predators. The marsupial lion lived alongside the thylacine Thylacinus cynocephalus, which survived until the 20th century. The preference of the thylacine for prey from more open habitats likely led to its survival, despite having a much weaker bite than the marsupial lion. Because of its extraordinarily specialized dentition, the marsupial lion has been declared to be the most specialized mammalian carnivore that ever evolved anywhere in the world, said Professor Michael Archer, a vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of New South Wales. Marsupial lions were far more specialized than African lions. They even had a proportionately larger brain than African lions as well as large, uniquely formidable, large can opener like thumb claws. Whats increasingly clear now is that it evidently survived the arrival of humans 60,000 years ago, but apparently not the profound impacts of a rapidly drying climate that undermined the survival of a range of megafaunal mammals in Australia.

The ancient fish, named Piranhamesodon pinnatomus, belongs to Pycnodontiformes, an extinct order of ray finned fishes that lived from Triassic to Eocene period. It comes from a group of fishes that are famous for their crushing teeth, said Dr. Martina K\u00f6lbl Ebert, a paleontologist at the Jura Museum Eichst\u00e4tt. It is like finding a sheep with a snarl like a wolf. But what was even more remarkable is that it was from the Jurassic. The nearly complete fossilized specimen of Piranhamesodon pinnatomus came from the Late Jurassic Plattenkalk deposits of the Solnhofen Archipelago, Bavaria, the same deposits that contained the famous feathered dinosaur Archaeopteryx. Careful study of the specimens well preserved jaws revealed long, pointed teeth on the exterior of the vomer, a bone forming the roof of the mouth, and at the front of both upper and lower jaws. Additionally, there are triangular teeth with serrated cutting edges on the prearticular bones that lie along the side of the lower jaw. The tooth pattern and shape, jaw morphology, and mechanics suggest a mouth equipped to slice flesh or fins. We were stunned that this fish had piranha like teeth, Dr. K\u00f6lbl Ebert said. The scientists also found the victims of Piranhamesodon pinnatomus other fish that had apparently been nibbled on in the same limestone deposits where this piranha like fish was found. We have other fish from the same locality with chunks missing from their fins, said Dr. David Bellwood, a researcher at James Cook University. This is an amazing parallel with modern piranhas, which feed predominantly not on flesh but the fins of other fishes. A paper reporting this discovery is published in the journal Current Biology.

Rather than searching for conventional body fossils, Professor Love and colleagues have been tracking molecular signs biomarkers of animal life as far back as 660 635 million years ago Neoproterozoic Era. In ancient rocks and oils from Oman, Siberia, and India, the team found a steroid compound produced only by sponges, which are among the earliest forms of animal life. We have been looking for distinctive and stable biomarkers that indicate the existence of sponges and other early animals, rather than single celled organisms that dominated the earth for billions of years before the dawn of complex, multicellular life, said Alex Zumberge, a doctoral student at the University of California, Riverside. The biomarker the researchers identified is a steroid compound named 26 methylstigmastane 26 mes. It has a unique structure that is currently only known to be synthesized by certain species of modern sponges called demosponges. This steroid biomarker is the first evidence that demosponges, and hence multicellular animals, were thriving in ancient seas at least as far back as 635 million years ago, Zumberge said. In 2009, the same team reported the first compelling biomarker evidence for Neoproterozoic animals from a different steroid biomarker, called 24 isopropylcholestane 24 ipc, from rocks in South Oman. However, the 24 ipc biomarker evidence proved controversial since 24 ipc steroids are not exclusively made by demosponges and can be found in a few modern algae. The finding of the additional and novel 26 mes ancient biomarker, which is unique to demosponges, adds extra confidence that both compounds are fossil biomolecules produced by demosponges on an ancient seafloor. The study also provides important new constraints on the groups of modern demosponges capable of producing unique steroid structures, which leave a distinctive biomarker record. The scientists found that within modern demosponges, certain taxonomic groups preferentially produce 26 mes steroids while others produce 24 ipc steroids. The combined Neoproterozoic demosponge sterane record, showing 24 ipc and 26 mes steranes co occurring in ancient rocks, is unlikely attributed to an isolated branch or extinct stem group of demosponges, Professor Love said. Rather, the ability to make such unconventional steroids likely arose deep within the demosponge phylogenetic tree but now encompasses a wide coverage of modern demosponge groups. The study was published online this week in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution.

A new, in depth anatomical description of the best preserved specimens of Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis, a sauropod relative from North America, could help paleontologists with unraveling the mystery of why these dinosaurs got so big. Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis lived in what is now Arizona about 185 million years ago Early Jurassic epoch. This dinosaur preserves in its anatomy the anatomical changes that were happening in the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic that were occurring in the evolutionary lineage. It can help tell us how getting big happens, said Dr. Adam Marsh, a paleontologist at Petrified Forest National Park. The new anatomical description of Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis  made by Dr. Marsh and his colleague, Professor Timothy Rowe from the University of Texas at Austin Jackson School of Geosciences  is based on two skeletons from the Kayenta Formation of Arizona. The specimens are well preserved in 3D and remarkably complete, which is very rare in the fossil record, said Dr. Matthew Brown, director of the Jackson School Museum of Earth History Vertebrate Paleontology Collections, who was not involved in the study. Such complete specimens help paleontologists better understand the fragmentary and incomplete fossils remains we typically find. Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis resembled a ground sloth. It stood upright, walked on its hind legs and had powerful forelimbs with a large, curved claw capping the first finger of each hand. It had a lot in common with the earliest sauropod ancestors  like walking on two legs  but it was also starting to show features that would foreshadow how its massive relatives would evolve  such as an increase in body size and a lengthening of the neck vertebrae. Its starting to gain the characters of getting large compared to the earliest members of the group, Dr. Marsh said. Size and neck length are features that sauropods would take to extremes as they evolved. By studying these traits and others in Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis, and seeing how they compare to those of other dinosaurs, scientists can help reveal how these changes occurred across evolutionary history and how different dinosaurs relate to one another. For example, the anatomical review helped clarify the relationship between Sarahsaurus aurifontanalis and two other sauropod relatives that lived in North America during the Early Jurassic Anchisaurus polyzelus from the older Portland Formation of the Hartford Basin and Seitaad reussi from the younger Navajo Sandstone of Utah. The paleontologists found that the three dont have a common North American ancestor  instead they evolved from dinosaur lineages that came to North America independently. The findings were published online October 10, 2018 in the journal PLoS ONE.

Mammals can walk, hop, swim and fly a few, like marsupial sugar gliders or colugos, can even glide. Flying squirrels are the only group of gliding mammals to have achieved a significant diversity 52 species in 15 genera and wide geographical distribution across Eurasia and North America. To drift from tree to tree, these small animals pack their own parachute a membrane draping between their lower limbs and the long cartilage rods that extend from their wrists. Tiny specialized wrist bones, which are unique to flying squirrels, help to support the cartilaginous extensions. The origin of flying squirrels is a point of contention while most genetic studies point towards the group splitting from tree squirrels about 23 million years ago, the oldest remains  mostly cheek teeth  suggest the animals were already soaring through forests 36 million years ago. However, recent studies show that the dental features used to distinguish between gliding and non gliding squirrels may actually be shared by the two groups. In 2002, Dr. Isaac Casanovas Vilar of the Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona and colleagues unearthed a peculiar skeleton first a tail and two thigh bones, big enough that the paleontologists thought it could be the fossil of a small primate. Due to the large size of the tail and thigh bones, we initially thought the remains belonged to a primate, Dr. Casanovas Vilar said. In fact, and much to the disappointment of paleoprimatologists, further excavation revealed that it was a large rodent skeleton with minuscule specialized wrist bones, identifying it as Miopetaurista neogrivensis. Combining molecular and paleontological data to carry out evolutionary analyses of the fossil, the researchers demonstrated that flying squirrels evolved from tree squirrels as far back as 31 to 25 million years ago, and possibly even earlier. In addition, their results showed that Miopetaurista neogrivensis is closely related to an existing group of giant flying squirrels called Petaurista. Their skeletons are in fact so similar that the large species that currently inhabits the tropical and subtropical forests of Asia could be considered living fossils. The problem is that these ancient remains are mainly teeth, Dr. Casanovas Vilar said. As the dental features used to distinguish between gliding and non gliding squirrels may actually be shared by the two groups, it is difficult to attribute the ancient teeth undoubtedly to a flying squirrel. In our study, we estimate that the split took place around 31 and 25 million years ago, earlier than previously thought, suggesting the oldest fossils may not belong to flying squirrels. Molecular and paleontological data are often at odds, but this fossil shows that they can be reconciled and combined to retrace history. Discovering even older fossils could help to retrace how flying squirrels diverged from the rest of their evolutionary tree. The study is published in the journal eLife.

Dr. Jud and colleagues found a whealth of plant and terrestrial vertebrate fossils  including a large petrified log of angiosperm tree  in deposits of the Mancos Shale Formation in Utah, the United States. The fossils date to the Turonian, a severely underrepresented interval in the terrestrial fossil record of North America. A large silicified log, 36 feet 11 m in preserved length with a maximum diameter estimate of 5.9 feet 1.8 m, is assigned to the genus Paraphyllanthoxylon, the paleontologists said. It is the largest known pre Campanian angiosperm and the earliest documented occurrence of an angiosperm tree more than 3.3 feet 1 m in diameter. Aside from the petrified log, they also found fossilized foliage from ferns, conifers and angiosperms, which confirm that there was forest or woodland vegetation 90 million years ago in the area, covering a large delta extending into the sea. Until now most of what we knew about plants from the Ferron Sandstone came from fossil pollen and spores, Dr. Jud noted. The discovery of fossil wood and leaves allows us to develop a more complete picture of the flora. The scientists also found turtle and crocodile remains as well as part of the pelvis of a duck billed dinosaur. Previously, the only known vertebrate remains found were fish teeth, two short dinosaur trackways, and a pterosaur. These discoveries add much more detail to our picture of the landscape during the Turonian period than we had previously, said co author Dr. Michael DEmic, a researcher at Adelphi University, the Burpee Museum of Natural History and Stony Brook University.

Named Ledumahadi mafube, the new dinosaur species weighed 12 tons, stood about 13 feet 4 m high at the hips, and is one of the closest relatives of sauropod dinosaurs. Sauropods, weighing up to 60 tons, include well known species like Brontosaurus. They ate plants and stood on four legs, with a posture like modern elephants. Ledumahadi mafube evolved its giant size independently from sauropods. It shows us that even as far back as 200 million years ago, these animals had already become the largest vertebrates to ever walk the Earth, said Professor Jonah Choiniere, a researcher in the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand. Many giant dinosaurs walked on four legs but had ancestors that walked on two legs, said Professor Roger Benson, a scientist in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Oxford and the Evolutionary Studies Institute at the University of the Witwatersrand. Paleontologists want to know about this evolutionary change, but amazingly, no one came up with a simple method to tell how each dinosaur walked, until now. To determine whether Ledumahadi mafube walked on two legs, like its ancestors, or on four, the researchers developed a method using measurements of todays animals. The method involved taking measurements of the thickness of dinosaurs limbs to infer their weight and how many limbs that weight must have been carried on. The teams findings suggest not only that this dinosaur was a quadruped, but also that many other early sauropodomorph dinosaurs often called prosauropods were experimenting with walking on all fours. The discovery shows that gigantic body sizes were possible in early four legged prosauropods, which arose from earlier two legged species, the paleontologists said. However, the early quadrupeds lacked the columnar, elephant like limb postures of later sauropod species such as Brontosaurus. The evolution of sauropods isnt quite as straightforward as we once thought, Professor Choiniere said. In fact, it appears that sauropodomorphs evolved four legged postures at least twice before they gained the ability to walk with upright limbs, which undoubtedly helped make them so successful in an evolutionary sense. More broadly, the findings show that millions of years before Tyrannosaurus or Velociraptor came on the scene in the northern hemisphere, there was a thriving dinosaur ecosystem here in South Africa, at the bottom of the world, featuring 12 ton giants like Ledumahadi mafube, tiny carnivores like Megapnosaurus, the earliest mammals, some of the earliest turtles, and many, many others, he said. Africa, and particularly South Africa, is known for its big game. I think we should be just as famous for our big game of the early Mesozoic, 200 million years ago. The findings appear in the journal Current Biology.

Elephant birds are members of the extinct family Aepyornithidae, with two genera  Aepyornis and Mullerornis  previously recognized by scientists. These enormous, flightless birds were rarities, like the ostrich, rhea, emu, cassowary and kiwi. They lived on the island of Madagascar during the Late Quaternary and went extinct somewhere around the 13th to 17th centuries. The first species of elephant bird to be described, Aepyornis maximus, has often been considered to be the worlds largest bird. In 1894, British scientist C.W. Andrews described an even larger species, Aepyornis titan, which has usually been dismissed as an unusually large specimen of Aepyornis maximus. However, the new study, led by James Hansford, reveals Aepyornis titan was indeed a distinct species. Now named Vorombe titan meaning big bird in Malagasy and Greek, the species had a body mass of 800 kg and grew up to 10 feet 3 m tall. Elephant birds were the biggest of Madagascars megafauna and arguably one of the most important in the islands evolutionary history  even more so than lemurs, Hansford said. This is because large bodied animals have an enormous impact on the wider ecosystem they live in via controlling vegetation through eating plants, spreading biomass and dispersing seeds through defecation. Madagascar is still suffering the effects of the extinction of these birds today. In the study, Hansford and his colleague, Professor Samuel Turvey, analyzed hundreds of elephant bird bones from museums across the globe to uncover the worlds largest bird, while also revealing their taxonomy is in fact spread across three genera and at least four distinct species thus, constituting the first taxonomic reassessment of the family in over 80 years. Without an accurate understanding of past species diversity, we cant properly understand evolution or ecology in unique island systems such as Madagascar or reconstruct exactly whats been lost since human arrival on these islands, Professor Turvey said. Knowing the history of biodiversity loss is essential to determine how to conserve todays threatened species. The study is published in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

The ancient bird, dubbed Jinguofortis perplexus, had a body mass of 250 g, a wing span of 27.5 inches 70 cm, and a unique combination of traits. This fossil bird had a jaw with small teeth like their theropod dinosaur relatives, explained Dr. Zhonghe Zhou, a researcher in the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It also had a short bony tail ending in a compound bone called a pygostyle that evolved after the earliest known bird, Archaeopteryx gizzard stones showing that it mostly ate plants and a third finger with only two bones in it unlike other early birds. Based on its skeleton and feathers, Jinguofortis perplexus probably flew a bit differently than birds do today. In flying birds, the shoulder, which experiences high stress during flight, is a tight joint between unfused bones, the paleontologists said. In contrast, Jinguofortis perplexus preserves a shoulder girdle where the major bones of the shoulder, the shoulder blade scapula and the coracoid, are fused to one another, forming a scapulocoracoid. The existence of a fused shoulder girdle in this short tailed fossil suggests evolutionary variety during this stage of evolution, which probably resulted in different styles of flight. Generally we think of the modern flight apparatus of living birds as having evolved through the gradual accumulation of refinements to their feathers, muscles, and bones over millions of years, said Dr. Thomas Stidham, also from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences. However, this new bird fossil shows that the evolution of flight was much more messy. Jinguofortis perplexus, together with another, less known bird fossil called Chongmingia zhengi, form the second earliest diverging group of the short tailed birds Pygostylia. To recognize that status, the researchers have named a new family Jinguofortisidae to include both species. The discovery of Jinguofortis perplexus increases the known diversity of pygostylian birds and highlights the importance of developmental plasticity for understanding mosaic evolution in early birds, they said. The discovery is reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Ediacaran fossils are as strange as life on another planet and have evaded taxonomic classification, with interpretations ranging from marine animals or giant single celled protists to lichens. Fossils of one of these creatures  a flat, oval shaped organism called Dickinsonia  have been particularly difficult to classify. Now, researchers from the Australian National University and elsewhere have analyzed biomarkers from organically preserved Dickinsonia fossils and found that the fossils contained cholesterol, a marker found only in animals. Dickinsonia is a large genus of extinct fossil organisms that includes around 200 species. These creatures grew up to 4.6 feet 1.4 m in length and were oval shaped with rib like segments running along the body. They belong to the Ediacaran biota, a group of soft bodied organisms that lived on Earth 20 million years prior to the Cambrian explosion of modern animal life. The Cambrian explosion was when complex animals and other macroscopic organisms began to dominate the fossil record, said Dr. Jochen Brocks, from the Research School of Earth Sciences at the Australian National University. Dr. Brocks, Australian National University PhD scholar Ilya Bobrovskiy and their colleagues discovered a Dickinsonia fossil so well preserved in a remote area near the White Sea that the tissue still contained molecules of cholesterol, a type of fat that is the hallmark of animal life. Paleontologists normally study the structure of fossils, but we extracted and analyzed molecules from inside the Dickinsonia fossil found in ancient rocks to make the breakthrough discovery, Bobrovskiy said. I took a helicopter to reach this very remote part of the world  home to bears and mosquitoes  where I could find Dickinsonia fossils with organic matter still intact, he added. These fossils were located in the middle of cliffs of the White Sea that are 200 to 330 feet 60 100 m high. I had to hang over the edge of a cliff on ropes and dig out huge blocks of sandstone, throw them down, wash the sandstone and repeat this process until I found the fossils I was after. The fossil fat molecules that weve found prove that animals were large and abundant 558 million years ago, millions of years earlier than previously thought, Dr. Brocks said. Scientists have been fighting for more than 75 years over what Dickinsonia and other bizarre fossils of the Edicaran biota were giant single celled amoeba, lichen, failed experiments of evolution or the earliest animals on Earth. The fossil fat now confirms Dickinsonia as the oldest known animal fossil, solving a decades old mystery that has been the Holy Grail of paleontology. The results appear in the journal Science. "}, {"title": " Mesosaurs: \u2018Oldest-Known Aquatic Reptiles\u2019 Were Semi-Aquatic, Paleontologists Say", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Sep 20, 2018", "doc": "According to new research published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, mesosaurs  the oldest known reptiles that developed aquatic adaptations  spent part of their life on land. Despite being considered the oldest known fully aquatic reptile, mesosaurs share several anatomical features with terrestrial species, said Professor Graciela Pi\u00f1eiro, from the Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica in Uruguay. Our comprehensive analysis of the vertebrae and limbs of these ancient reptiles suggests they lived in the water during the earliest stages of their development, whereas mature adults spent more time on land. Since the discovery of Mesosaurus bones in the Mangrullo Formation of Uruguay, Professor Pi\u00f1eiro and co authors wondered why the larger, presumably adult specimens around 6.5 feet, or 2 m, in length were not as abundant as smaller mesosaur skeletons around 3 feet, or 0.9 m, in length. The larger specimens, at least twice the length of the more commonly reported Mesosaurus fossils, could just be exceptionally big individuals, Professor Pi\u00f1eiro said. However, the environmental conditions of the Mangrullo lagoon of where they lived were harsh, making it difficult for the occasional mesosaur to reach such a relatively large size and age. We then realized that in comparison to the smaller, better preserved specimens, larger Mesosaurus fossils were almost always disarticulated, very weathered and badly preserved. This suggested these larger specimens had extended exposure to the air when they died. Terrestrial, semi aquatic and aquatic animals show a clear difference in bone profiles, so Professor Pi\u00f1eiro and colleagues used morphometrics to analyze the shape of the fossilized mesosaur bones. They examined 40 juveniles and adult specimens of Mesosaurus tenuidens and compared their bone profiles to those of similar reptiles known to be aquatic or semi aquatic, such as crocodiles and marine iguanas. The adult mesosaur tarsus  a cluster of bones in the ankle region  suggests a more terrestrial or amphibious locomotion rather than a fully aquatic behavior as widely suggested before, said Dr. Pablo N\u00fa\u00f1ez, also from the Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica. Their caudal vertebrae, the tail bones, also showed similarities to semi aquatic and terrestrial animals. This supports the hypothesis that the oldest and largest mesosaurs spent more time on land, where fossil preservation is not as good as in the subaquatic domain.

For more than 18 million years, diverse reptile species lived together in a single seaway called the Jurassic Sub Boreal Seaway of the United Kingdom. Until now, however, little was known about the structure of the food chain in this region or how it changed as sea levels rose. By analyzing the shape and size of teeth spanning this period when water levels fluctuated, University of Edinburgh paleontologist Davide Foffa and colleagues found that species belonged to one of five groups based on their teeth, diet and which part of the ocean they inhabited. The pattern is very similar to the food chain structure of modern oceans, where many different species are able to co exist in the same area because they do not compete for the same resources. Studying the evolution of these animals was a real  and rare  treat, and has offered a simple yet powerful explanation for why some species declined as others prospered, Foffa said. Teeth are humble fossils, but they reveal a grand story of how sea reptiles evolved over millions of years as their environments changed, added co author Dr. Steve Brusatte, also from the University of Edinburgh. Changes in these Jurassic reptiles parallel changes in dolphins and other marine species that are occurring today as sea levels rise, which speaks to how important fossils are for understanding our modern world. As global sea levels rose, Jurassic reptiles that lived in shallow waters and caught fish using thin, piercing teeth declined drastically, the team found. At the same time, larger species that inhabited deeper, open waters began to thrive. These reptiles had broader teeth for crunching and cutting prey. Deep water species may have flourished as a result of major changes in ocean temperature and chemical make up that also took place during the period, the researchers said. This could have increased levels of nutrients and prey in deep waters, benefiting species that lived there. The findings were published online this week in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution. "}, {"title": " Jurassic Mammal Precursor Had Tiny Brain", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Sep 3, 2018", "doc": "A team of paleontologists from the University of Texas at Austin has uncovered fossils of an adult female Kayentatherium wellesi  an extinct tritylodontid cynodont that lived alongside dinosaurs about 185 million years ago Jurassic period  and her babies at least 38 individuals. The find is among the best evidence that a key development in the evolution of mammals was trading brood power for brain power. The find is among the rarest of the rare because it contains the only known fossils of babies from any mammal precursor, said Eva Hoffman and Professor Timothy Rowe from the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin. But the presence of so many babies  more than twice the average litter size of any living mammal  revealed that it reproduced in a manner akin to reptiles. Kayentatherium wellesis babies were probably developing inside eggs or had just recently hatched when they died. These babies are from a really important point in the evolutionary tree, Hoffman said. They had a lot of features similar to modern mammals, features that are relevant in understanding mammalian evolution. The in depth analysis of the specimens revealed that the skulls of the babies were like scaled down replicas of the adult, with skulls a tenth the size but otherwise proportional. This finding is in contrast to mammals, which have babies that are born with shortened faces and bulbous heads to account for big brains. The discovery that Kayentatherium wellesi had a tiny brain and many babies, despite otherwise having much in common with mammals, suggests that a critical step in the evolution of mammals was trading big litters for big brains, and that this step happened later in mammalian evolution. Just a few million years later, in mammals, they unquestionably had big brains, and they unquestionably had a small litter size, Professor Rowe said. The mammalian approach to reproduction directly relates to human development  including the development of our own brains. By looking back at our early mammalian ancestors, humans can learn more about the evolutionary process that helped shape who we are as a species, he said. There are additional deep stories on the evolution of development, and the evolution of mammalian intelligence and behavior and physiology that can be squeezed out of a remarkable fossil like this now that we have the technology to study it. The findings were published in the journal Nature. "}, {"title": " New Jersey Fossils Shed Light on Theropod Dinosaurs of Eastern United States", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Aug 30, 2018", "doc": "On the east coast of North America, dinosaur fossils are rare finds. Owing to several factors, such as the mass urbanization of the eastern seaboard, fossils from these incredible creatures are few and far between. Even the most complete skeletons are incomplete, making nearly any stray chunk of bone from the area of scientific interest. Discovered in the early 80s, the Ellisdale fossil site of New Jersey has become well known for preserving an unusually complete record of terrestrial animals from the eastern coast of North America from 75 million years ago, when the continent was divided as two landmasses by a large interior sea. Yet, the dinosaur fossils of the site have never been formally described. Since 2014, researcher Chase Brownstein of the Stamford Museum and Nature Center has been tracking down elusive eastern North American dinosaurs. Recently, Brownstein has been working on describing the ample assemblage of bones from one group of dinosaurs, the theropods, from Ellisdale. This group of dinosaurs, which includes giant carnivores like Tyrannosaurus, smaller predators like Velociraptor, herbivorous species like the long necked, massive claw bearing Therizinosaurus, is the lineage to which birds belong. At Ellisdale, the diversity of this dinosaur group is evinced by the fossils. After viewing the theropod bones and teeth from Ellisdale stored at the New Jersey State Museum, Brownstein concluded that perhaps four different species are represented at the site, one of the most diverse faunas of these dinosaurs known from east of the Mississippi River. Tyrannosaurs distantly related to T. rex are known from teeth and a single foot bone. The teeth recovered may indicate the presence of two types of these large carnivores in the ecosystem. Another type of dinosaur that resembled an ostrich known as an ornithomimosaur is represented by a single foot bone. One particularly interesting finding is that several teeth previously recognized as those of tyrannosaurs are in fact those of giant dromaeosaurid, or raptor, dinosaurs potentially more than 13 feet 4 m long. Some of these teeth, although incomplete, are as large or larger than teeth from other giant raptor dinosaurs already known from western North America. Finally, some teeth from smaller raptor dinosaurs are also known from Ellisdale. As small dinosaurs are very poorly known from eastern North America, these fossils are an important addition to the record of smaller dinosaur bones. These bones and teeth may not be more than a few isolated, fragmentary pieces, said Brownstein, but they can greatly help us in better grasping aspects of dinosaur biology like their global diversity, distribution, and evolution. For one, the Ellisdale assemblage of theropod dinosaurs is the only one known from the northeast that overlaps in age with sites from both the southeastern U.S. and western North America, allowing us to better compare dinosaur faunas from across the entire continent. Sites like Ellisdale, although they do not produce anything along the lines of the complete skeletons known from Asia and western North America, should not be overlooked. They are a great asset to the study of paleontology because of their ability to produce fossils at all in fossil poor regions, allowing for glimpses at the places whose deep past has been so greatly obscured. The research was published in the Journal of Paleontology. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Discover Three New Fossil Primates", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Aug 29, 2018", "doc": "Paleontologists at the University of Texas at Austin have identified three new species of omomyine primates that lived between 42 and 46 million years ago Eocene epoch. The three new species  named Ekwiiyemakius walshi, Gunnelltarsius randalli and Brontomomys cerutti  belong to Omomyinae, a subfamily of early primates. The fossils came from the Friars Formation of San Diego County, southern California. Ekwiiyemakius walshi, the smallest of the three new species, had a mass of 113 125 grams, comparable in size to some modern bushbabies, said University of Texas at Austins Professor Chris Kirk and graduate student Amy Atwater. The species is named for paleontologist Stephen Walsh from the San Diego Museum of Natural History, who collected and prepared many of the specimens from the Friars Formation, and also derives from the Native American Kumeyaay tribes place name, Ekwiiyemak  meaning behind the clouds  for the location of the headwaters of the San Diego and Sweetwater Rivers. Gunnelltarsius randalli is named for Gregg Gunnell, expert on Eocene mammals, and for San Diego Museum of Natural History fossil collections manager Kesler Randall. It had a mass of 275 303 grams, about the size of todays fat tailed dwarf lemur. Brontomomys cerutti was large compared with most other omomyoids and had a mass of 719 796 grams, about the size of a living sportive lemur. Due to its large size, its name derives from the Greek word bront\u0113 thunder, as well as for Richard Cerutti, the retired San Diego Museum of Natural History paleontologist responsible for collecting many of the Brontomomys specimens. These findings increase the total number of known Eocene omomyine primates from 15 to 18. The addition of these primates provides for a better understanding of primate richness in the middle Eocene, Atwater said. Previous research in the Rocky Mountain basins suggested the primate richness declined during this time period, but we argue that primate richness increased concurrently in other locations. The three new species are described in a paper published in the Journal of Human Evolution.

Parasitic lifestyles are extremely successful among animals and evolved independently, perhaps hundreds of times, Dr. van de Kamp and co authors said. With an estimated 50 of species, parasites comprise a huge proportion of animal life on Earth, and the arms races between parasites and their hosts are considered major driving forces for evolution. In insects, parasitism is especially diverse in the order Hymenoptera, where many wasp species develop as parasitoids on or within an arthropod host. The fossil record of parasitoid wasps is nearly exclusively restricted to isolated adults, with few examples of unidentified larvae trapped in amber next to their hosts. Using synchrotron based X ray microtomography, the team examined 1,510 phosphatized fly pupae from the Paleogene period of France. The fossils we studied belong to the collections of the Natural History Museum of Basel and the Swedish Museum of Natural History, the researchers said. They were collected in the phosphorite mines of the Paleogene fissure fillings of the Quercy region in south central France in the late 19th century, but the exact locality, collection date and the original collector are unknown. In 1944, Swiss entomologist Eduard Handschin described these fossils in detail and emphasized the value of the externally inconspicuous pieces of merely 3 mm in length. Still, they have fallen into oblivion for more than 70 years. At that time, Handschin had suspected the contours of a parasitic wasp in a thin section of a probably 34 to 40 million year old fly pupa, but could not prove it.  In total, the scientists identified 55 parasitation events by four previously unknown ancient species of parasitoid wasps Xenomorphia resurrecta, Xenomorphia handschini, Coptera anka and Palaeortona quercyensis. These wasps belong to the single family Diapriidae, they said. The most common species was Xenomorphia resurrecta, of which we found 18 females and 24 males, followed by Xenomorphia handschini with one female, four males and one pupa and Coptera anka with three females and one male. Palaeortona quercyensis was represented by one female only. Each of the four parasitic wasp species had its own strategy for adaptation to the host. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications.

Xiyunykus pengi and Bannykus wulatensis are both alvarezsaurs, an enigmatic group of dinosaurs that share many characteristics with birds. Their bodies are slender, with a bird like skull and many small teeth instead of the usual large, sharp cutting teeth of their meat eating relatives. Alvarezsaurs are weird animals. With their strong, clawed hands and weak jaws, they appear to be the dinosaurian analogue to todays aardvarks and anteaters, said Professor Jonah Choiniere, from the University of the Witwatersrand. Xiyunykus pengi was discovered in 2005 in Xinjiang, north western China. Bannykus wulatensis was discovered a few years later, in 2009, in Inner Mongolia, north central China. When we described the first well known alvarezsaur, Mononykus, in 1993, we were amazed at the contrast between its mole like arms and its roadrunner like body, but there were few fossils connecting it back to other theropod groups, said Professor James Clark, a paleontologist at the George Washington University. However, alvarezsaurs did not always look this way. Early members of the group had relatively long arms with strong clawed hands and typical meat eating teeth. Over time, the alvarezsaurs evolved into dinosaurs with mole like arms and a single claw. This transition plays out in an incremental fashion over more than 50 million years. It could one day potentially serve as a classic example of macroevolution akin to the horse series of North America, said Dr. Xing Xu, a researcher at the Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The discovery of Xiyunykus pengi and Bannykus wulatensis allowed the team to uncover an important shift in how the specialized features of the alvarezsaurs evolved. It can be hard to pin down the relationships of highly specialized animals, Professor Choiniere said. But fossil species with transitional features, like Xiyunykus pengi and Bannykus wulatensis, are tremendously helpful because they link bizarre anatomical features to more typical ones. The new fossils have long arms, and so show that alvarezsaurs evolved short arms only later in their evolutionary history, in species with small body sizes, said Oxford Universitys Professor Roger Benson. This is quite different to what happens in the classic example of tyrannosaurs, which have short arms and giant size. The findings appear in the journal Current Biology.

Named Eorhynchochelys sinensis, the newly discovered turtle lived approximately 228 million years ago Triassic period in what is now southwestern China. This creature was over 6 feet long 1.8 m, it had a strange disc like body and a long tail, and the anterior part of its jaws developed into this strange beak. It probably lived in shallow water and dug in the mud for food, said Dr. Olivier Rieppel, a paleontologist at Field Museum. Eorhynchochelys sinensis isnt the only kind of early turtle that paleontologists have discovered  there is another early turtle with a partial shell but no beak. Until now, its been unclear how they all fit into the reptile family tree. The origin of turtles has been an unsolved problem in paleontology for many decades. Now with Eorhynchochelys sinensis, how turtles evolved has become a lot clearer. The fact that Eorhynchochelys sinensis developed a beak before other early turtles but didnt have a shell is evidence of mosaic evolution  the idea that traits can evolve independently from each other and at a different rate, and that not every ancestral species has the same combination of these traits. Modern turtles have both shells and beaks, but the path evolution took to get there wasnt a straight line. Instead, some turtle relatives got partial shells while others got beaks, and eventually, the genetic mutations that create these traits occurred in the same animal. This impressively large fossil is a very exciting discovery giving us another piece in the puzzle of turtle evolution. It shows that early turtle evolution was not a straightforward, step by step accumulation of unique traits but was a much more complex series of events that we are only just beginning to unravel, said Dr. Nick Fraser, from the National Museums Scotland. Fine details in Eorhynchochelys sinensis skull solved another turtle evolution mystery. For years, paleontologists werent sure if turtle ancestors were part of the same reptile group as modern lizards and snakes  diapsids, which early in their evolution had two holes on the sides of their skulls  or if they were anapsids that lack these openings. The skull of Eorhynchochelys sinensis shows signs that the species was a diapsid. With Eorhynchochelys sinensis diapsid skull, we know that turtles are not related to the early anapsid reptiles, but are instead related to evolutionarily more advanced diapsid reptiles. This is cemented, the debate is over, Dr. Rieppel said. Eorhynchochelys sinensis is described in a paper published online this week in the journal Nature.

Scientists have long sought to understand ancient life and the shared evolutionary history of life as a whole. However, the fossil record of early life is extremely fragmented, and its quality significantly deteriorates further back in time towards the Archean eon, more than 2.5 billion years ago, when the Earths crust had cooled enough to allow the formation of continents and the only life forms were microbes. Now University of Bristol researcher Holly Betts and colleagues have used a combination of genomic and fossil data to explain the history of life on Earth, from its origin to the present day. There are few fossils from the Archean and they generally cannot be unambiguously assigned to the lineages we are familiar with, like the blue green algae or the salt loving Archaebacteria that colors salt marshes pink all around the world, Betts said. The problem with the early fossil record of life is that it is so limited and difficult to interpret  careful reanalysis of the some of the very oldest fossils has shown them to be crystals, not fossils at all. Fossil evidence for the early history of life is so fragmented and difficult to evaluate that new discoveries and reinterpretations of known fossils have led to a proliferation of conflicting ideas about the timescale of the early history of life. Fossils do not represent the only line of evidence to understand the past. A second record of life exists, preserved in the genomes of all living creatures, said co author Professor Philip Donoghue, from the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol. Combining fossil and genomic information, we can use an approach called the molecular clock which is loosely based on the idea that the number of differences in the genomes of two living species say a human and a bacterium are proportional to the time since they shared a common ancestor, added co author Dr. Tom Williams, also from the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol. By making use of this method the researchers were able to derive a timescale for the history of life on Earth that did not rely on the ever changing age of the oldest accepted fossil evidence of life. Using this approach we were able to show that the Last Universal Common Ancestor of cellular life LUCA existed very early in Earths history, almost 4.5 billion years ago  not long after Earth was impacted by the protoplanet Theia, the event which sterilized Earth and led to the formation of the Moon, senior author Professor Davide Pisani, from the Schools of Earth and Biological Sciences from the University of Bristol. This is significantly earlier than the currently accepted oldest fossil evidence would suggest. Our results indicate that two primary lineages of life emerged from LUCA Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, approximately 1 billion years after LUCA. The study confirms modern views that the eukaryotes, the lineage to which human life belongs together with the plants and the fungi, for example, is not a primary lineage of life. It is rather humbling to think we belong to a lineage that is billions of years younger than life itself, Professor Pisani said. The findings are published in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution.

The discovery of this early pterosaur, reported in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution, sheds new light on early pterosaur anatomy and development. Pterosaurs were giant flying reptiles that flew over the heads of the dinosaurs. Soaring on skin wings supported by a single huge finger, they were the largest animals ever to take wing. Originating in the Late Triassic epoch around 215 million years ago, they thrived to the end of the Cretaceous period 66 million years ago. Triassic pterosaurs are extraordinarily rare and are known exclusively from marine deposits in the Alps Italy, Austria and Switzerland, except for Arcticodactylus cromptonellus from fluvial deposits in Greenland. The new Triassic pterosaur is from the Saints  Sinners Quarry near Dinosaur National Monument in Utah. Named Caelestiventus hanseni, the ancient flying reptile was comparatively large wing span over 5 feet, or 1.5 m and lived in harsh desert environments. It is the only record of desert dwelling non pterodactyloid pterosaurs. It predates all known desert pterosaurs by more than 65 million years. Were getting insights into the beginning of pterosaus. Ours shows that theyre extraordinarily diverse, said Brigham Young Universitys Dr. Brooks Britt. Caelestiventus hanseni was found in sandstone so the bones were not crushed. Rather than trying to extricate the thin bones from the sandstone, Dr. Britt and colleagues CT scanned the specimen and created 3D models of the bones for study. Most Triassic specimens consist of just a single bone for example, a little phalanx from a finger or one vertebra from the neck, Dr. Britt said. For this animal, we have the sides of the face and the complete roof of the skull, including the brain case, complete lower jaws and part of the wing. Caelestiventus hansenis 3D bones provide insights into the evolution of the earliest pterosaurs  especially the skull. These insights include the muscles attached and the nature of the teeth, which numbered about 112, the paleontologists said. Furthermore, the skull roof preserves the impression of the brain, which reveals that even early pterosaurs had a poor sense of smell and well developed vision. Caelestiventus hanseni is most closely related to Dimorphodon macronyx, known only from Lower Jurassic strata of Britain, they said. This indicates that the family Dimorphodontidae originated in the latest Triassic and the lineage survived the Triassic Jurassic mass extinction event.

I was walking along the beach looking for fossils, turned and saw this shining glint in a boulder and saw a quarter of the tooth exposed, Mullaly explained. I was immediately excited, it was just perfect and I knew it was an important find that needed to be shared with people. The teeth belonged to Carcharocles angustidens, an extinct species thats closely related to the famous giant C. megalodon. Carcharocles angustidens lived between 22 and 33 million years ago Oligocene epoch. This shark grew up to 30 feet 9 m in length, was the top predator and would have preyed on small whales. These teeth are of international significance, as they represent one of just three associated groupings of Carcharocles angustidens teeth in the world, and the very first set to ever be discovered in Australia, said Dr. Erich Fitzgerald, senior curator of vertebrate paleontology at Museums Victoria. Realizing the fossilized shark teeth was all from the same species, Dr. Fitzgerald and colleagues suspected that they came from one individual shark and there might be more teeth at Jan Juc. So, they organized two expeditions to excavate the site, where they were able to collect more than 40 shark teeth. Most of the teeth belonged to Carcharocles angustidens, but in addition, they found something even more surprising  several teeth of a smaller shark, the sixgill shark genus Hexanchus. These smaller teeth came from several different individuals and would have become dislodged from their jaws as they fed on the huge carcass of Carcharocles angustidens, said Museums Victoria paleontologist Tim Ziegler. The teeth of the sixgill shark work like a crosscut saw, and tore into Carcharocles angustidens like loggers felling a tree. The stench of blood and decaying flesh would have drawn scavengers from far around.Sixgill sharks still live off the Victorian coast today, where they live off the remains of whales and other animals. This find suggests they have performed that lifestyle here for tens of millions of years."}, {"title": " Cretaceous Alaska Was \u2018Superhighway\u2019 for Migrating Dinosaurs, Paleontologists Say", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Aug 8, 2018", "doc": "Paleontologists have discovered the first North American co occurrence of hadrosaur and therizinosaur tracks, providing more evidence that Alaska was the superhighway for dinosaurs between Asia and western North America 65 70 million years ago Late Cretaceous epoch. In 2012 2014, Dr. Anthony Fiorillo from the Perot Museum of Nature and Science and colleagues discovered distinct footprints in Denali National Park, central Alaska Range, that they determined to be made by therizinosaurs, unusual predatory dinosaurs thought to have become herbivores. What surprised the team most was the co occurrence of dozens of hadrosaurs, also known as duck bill dinosaurs. Hadrosaurs are very common and found all over Denali National Park. Previously, they had not been found alongside therizinosaurs in the park, Dr. Fiorillo said. In Mongolia, where therizinosaurs are best known  though no footprints have been found in association  skeletons of hadrosaurs and therizinosaurs have been found to co occur from a single rock unit so this was a highly unusual find in Alaska, and it prompted my interest. From our research, weve determined that this track association of therizinosaurs and hadrosaurs is currently the only one of its kind in North America. The plant eating therizinosaurs, which are rare and unusual creatures in the fossil record, had long skinny necks, little teeth, a small beak for cropping plants, and big torsos accompanied by large hind feet and long arms. Though therizinosaurs are known from Asia and North America, the best and most diverse fossil record is from Asia  even up to the time of extinction  and therein is the connection. Dr. Fiorillo has long postulated that Cretaceous Alaska could have been the thoroughfare for fauna between Western North America and Asia  two continents that shared each others fauna and flora in the latest stages of the Cretaceous. This study helps support the idea that Alaska was the gateway for dinosaurs as they migrated between Asia and North America, said co author Dr. Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, of Hokkaido University Museum in Japan. To support the theory, the researchers worked to establish if the tracks were those of a therizinosaur and to study any unique aspects of the ecosystem. They determined that this particular area of Denali was a wet, marsh like environment and that one fossil in particular looked like a water lily, which supported the theory that there were ponds and standing water nearby. They suspect that both therizinosaurs and hadrosaurs liked these wetter locations. This Alaskan discovery may connect these animals environmentally and perhaps behaviorally to other therizinosaurs in central Asia, Dr. Fiorillo said. The research appears in the journal Scientific Reports.

Until now, very little was known about the dietary evolution of cave bears and how they became vegetarians, as the fossils of Deningers bear are extremely scarce. However, a study by paleontologists in Germany and Spain sheds new light on this. To understand the evolution of the cave bear lineage, Dr. Anneke van Heteren from the Zoologische Staatssammlung M\u00fcnchen and the Ludwig Maximilians Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen and colleagues compared the mandibles and skull of the Deningers bear with that of classic cave bears and modern bears. They micro CT scanned the rare fossils and digitally removed the sediments so as not to risk damaging the fossils. The analyses showed that Deningers bear had very similarly shaped mandibles and skull to the classic cave bear, Dr. van Heteren said. This implies that they were adapted to the same food types and were primarily vegetarian. There is an ongoing discussion on the extent to which the classic cave bear was a vegetarian, added study co author Mikel Arlegi, a doctoral candidate at the Universities of the Basque Country and Bordeaux. And, this is especially why the new information on the diet of its direct ancestor is so important, because it teaches us that a differentiation between the diet of cave bears and brown bears was already established by 500,000 years ago and likely earlier. Interestingly, the team also found that there are shape differences between Deningers bears from the Iberian Peninsula and those from the rest of Europe, which are unlikely to be related to diet. There are three possibilities to explain these differences i the Iberian bears are chronologically younger than the rest ii the Pyrenees, acting as natural barrier, resulted in some genetic differentiation between the Iberian bears and those from the rest of Europe or iii there were multiple lineages, with either just one leading to the classic cave bear, or each lineage leading to a different group of cave bears, they said. However, more fossils are necessary to test these hypotheses, said co author Dr. Asier G\u00f3mez Olivencia, from the University of the Basque Country. The research is described in a paper published this month in the Historical Biology, an international journal of paleobiology.

Lingwulong shenqi, which lived approximately 174 million years ago Middle Jurassic epoch, is the earliest known example of a type of sauropod dinosaur called a neosauropod. Sauropod dinosaurs originated around 200 million years ago, but they only started to dominate terrestrial ecosystems by developing gigantic body size and new adaptations for obtaining and processing plant food. These giant neosauropod descendants were thought to originate around 160 million years ago, rapidly diversifying and spreading across the world during a time window perhaps as short as just 5 million years. We were surprised to find a close relative of Diplodocus in East Asia 174 million years ago, said Professor Paul Upchurch, from the Department of Earth Sciences at University College London, UK. Its commonly thought that sauropods did not disperse there until 200 million years ago and many of their giant descendants, reached this region much later, if at all. Our discovery of Lingwulong shenqi demonstrates that several different types of advanced sauropod must have existed at least 15 million years earlier and spread across the world while the supercontinent Pangaea was still a coherent landmass. This forces a complete re evaluation of the origins and evolution of these animals. For the study, Professor Upchurch and colleagues analyzed the fossilized skeletons of 7 10 individual dinosaurs that were found together in rocks in 2005. We organized four excavations at a new dinosaur site in the lower Middle Jurassic Yanan Formation at Ciyaopu, Lingwu, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which resulted in the discovery of fossil material comprising 7 10 partial skeletons including portions of two skulls, ranging from juveniles to adults, they said. The new evidence also reinforces the growing realization that the Early Jurassic 200 175 million years ago, was a key time in dinosaur evolution, witnessing the origins and diversification of many groups that went on to dominate the later Jurassic and Cretaceous. Diplodocus like neosauropods were thought to have never made it to East Asia because this region was cut off from the rest of the world by Jurassic seaways, so that China evolved its own distinctive and separate dinosaur fauna, said Dr. Xing Xu, from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology  Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. However, Lingwulong shenqi shows that these Diplodocus like sauropods were present after all, and implies that the isolation of East Asia was less profound and short lived than we realized.

The 39 inch wide 1 m foot was excavated from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation by University of Kansas paleontologists in 1998. Now, after detailed preparation and study, Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center researcher Anthony Maltese and co authors identified it as belonging to a dinosaur species very closely related to the long necked, long tailed sauropod Brachiosaurus. It was immediately apparent that the foot was from an extremely large animal, so the specimen was nicknamed Bigfoot, said Dr. Maltese, who was part of the original University of Kansas team in 1998. The scientists used 3D scanning and detailed measurements to compare the specimen to feet from numerous dinosaur species. The study confirms that this brachiosaur foot is the largest dinosaur foot discovered to date. There are tracks and other incomplete skeletons from Australia and Argentina that seem to be from even bigger animals, but those gigantic skeletons were found without the feet, said Dr. Emanuel Tschopp, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, the Universidade Nova de Lisboa and the Museu da Lourinh\u00e3. This beast was clearly one of the biggest that ever walked in North America. The study also shows that brachiosaurs inhabited a huge area from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming. This is surprising. Many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas during that time, Dr. Tschopp said. The brachiosaur foot is described in a paper published today in the journal PeerJ.

The discovery is reported in the journal PeerJ. Akainacephalus johnsoni lived approximately 76 million years ago and was 13 16 feet 4 5 m long and 3.5 feet 1 1.5 m tall at the hips. This species belongs to a group of four legged herbivorous armored dinosaurs called ankylosaurids family Ankylosauridae that lived in Asia and western North America during the Late Cretaceous epoch 100 66 million years ago. One of the unique features of these creatures is the presence of a characteristic bony tail club. The fossilized partial skeleton of Akainacephalus johnsoni  including a complete skull, much of the vertebral column, a complete tail club, several fore and hind limbs elements, and bony body armor  was recovered from the Kaiparowits Formation in Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in Kane County, southern Utah. The unique arrangement of bony armor in the shape of small cones and pyramids covering the snout and head of this dinosaur is the key research finding indicating that it is closely related to Nodocephalosaurus kirtlandensis, an ankylosaurid dinosaur that lived about 77 million years ago in what is now New Mexico. Surprisingly, Akainacephalus johnsoni and Nodocephalosaurus kirtlandensis are more closely related to Asian ankylosaurids such as Saichania and Tarchia than to other Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids, including Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus. Both of the latter species possess flat skull armor. A reasonable hypothesis would be that ankylosaurids from Utah are related to those found elsewhere in western North America, so we were really surprised to discover that Akainacephalus johnsoni was so closely related to species from Asia, Dr. Irmis said.  Though ankylosaurids originated in Asia between 125 and 100 million years ago, they do not appear in the North American fossil record until around 77 million years ago. Akainacephalus johnsoni once roamed the southern part of Laramidia, a landmass on the western coast of a shallow sea that flooded the central region, splitting the continent of North America in two. This caused isolation along western and eastern portions of the North American continent during the Late Cretaceous epoch, between 95 70 million years ago. The geographic distribution of Late Cretaceous ankylosaurids throughout the Western Interior was the result of several geologically brief intervals of lowered sea level that allowed Asian ankylosaurid dinosaurs to immigrate to North America several times during the Late Cretaceous, resulting in the presence of two separate groups of ankylosaurid dinosaurs, Wiersma said. This lowering of sea levels exposed the Beringian land bridge, allowing dinosaurs and other animals to move between Asia and North America. Such is exactly the case with Akainacephalus johnsoni not only is this the first described and named Late Cretaceous ankylosaurid dinosaur from Utah, but this unique animal also strengthens the evidence that distinct northern and southern provincialism existed during the late Campanian stage in Laramidia, because to date, we dont see this type of ankylosaurid dinosaurs in the fossil record of northern Laramidia. From our observations we can conclude that at least two immigration events took place during Late Cretaceous times when lowered sea levels exposed the Beringian land bridge, connecting Asia with western North America.

The fossil is a 1.6 inch 4.75 cm long postcranial skeleton made up of 97 vertebrae the snakes head is missing. It dates from the Late Cretaceous epoch, approximately 99 million years ago. This snake, named Xiaophis myanmarensis, is linked to ancient snakes from Argentina, Africa, India and Australia, said University of Albertas Professor Michael Caldwell. It is an important  and until now, missing  component of understanding snake evolution from southern continents, that is Gondwana, in the mid Mesozoic. At 99 million years old, it dates back to the age of the dinosaurs, well before snakes started to differentiate into modern groups, added Dr. Alessandro Palci, from Flinders University and the South Australian Museum, Australia. This Asian fossil helps shed light on how primitive snakes dispersed from the southern to the northern continents. Although found in the northern hemisphere, it strongly resembles South American snakes that lived at the time. The amber fragment in which Xiaophis myanmarensis was found also provided important clues about its environment. It is clear that this little snake was living in a forested environment with numerous insects and plants, as these are preserved in the clast, Professor Caldwell said. Not only do we have the first baby snake, we also have the first definitive evidence of a fossil snake living in a forest. About 150 million years ago Late Jurassic epoch, Myanmar was joined to Australia, Antarctica, Africa and South America, forming the supercontinent Gondwana. Through continental drift, Myanmar eventually separated from Gondwana and drifted north, until it collided with Asia. Xiaophis myanmarensis was part of the fauna that rode on this drifting landmass, which like a gigantic passenger ship transported all sorts of Gondwanan plants and animals to Asia, said Professor Michael Lee, also from Flinders University and the South Australian Museum. In fact, even though this snake was found in the northern hemisphere it resembles Gondwanan snakes. Along with Xiaophis myanmarensis, the team found and studied a second piece of amber with what appears to be a fragment of shed skin from a much larger snake. The scales of the snake are diamond shaped or ovoid diamond shaped, with deep lines formed by skin between each scale. Some rows converge as observed ventrally in extant snakes, the scientists said. No enlarged ventral scales can be observed. Light and dark areas distributed across the shed skin reveal color patterning. The degree of preservation allowed the researchers to model the pigmentation pattern of the animal in life. The research is published in the journal Science Advances.

The team, headed by Dr. Cecilia Apaldetti from the Institute and Museum of Natural Sciences at the University of San Juan and CONICET, discovered the earliest known sauropod dinosaur. Named Ingentia prima, the ancient creature lived in what is now northwestern Argentina at the end of the Triassic period. At about 23 33 feet 7 10 m in length and approximately 10 tons in weight, it was about three times the size of the largest Triassic dinosaurs. Two partial fossilized skeletons of Ingentia prima were recovered from the southern outcrops of the Quebrada del Barro Formation in Argentinas San Juan province. This new species shows a strategy of growth unknown until now and indicates that the origin of gigantism came much earlier than previously thought, Dr. Apaldetti said. Before this discovery, it was thought that gigantism developed during the Jurassic period, approximately 180 million years ago, but Ingentia prima lived at the end of the Triassic, between 210 and 205 million years ago. Ingentia primas bones displayed cyclical and seasonal growth, according to the team. Just as growth seasons can be observed in a tree, the bony cuts in Ingentia prima show that it had cyclical, seasonal growth, but what is striking is that the type of tissue that was deposited in the bones during these periods of growth is different from the other sauropods we knew so far, said Dr. Ignacio Cerda, a paleontologist at the National University of R\u00edo Negro and the Carlos Ameghino Provincial Museum. Cyclic growth was common among the primitive Triassic sauropods, but no other species exceeded 10 feet 3 m in length and 3 tons of body mass. The difference is that the tissue formed in the rest of these sauropods did not have such a rapid deposition speed. Ingentia prima had another evolutionary feature that also would have favored its gigantism. Cavities are observed in the bones of Ingentia prima, which lightened the weight of this species and would have favored it to acquire a larger size bodily, said Dr. Oscar Alcober, a researcher with the Institute and Museum of Natural Sciences at the University of San Juan. These pneumatic cavities indicate that this new species had highly developed air sacs and a very efficient breathing system, similar to what happens in modern birds, which also helped it to keep its body cool despite its large size, Dr. Apaldetti added. The discovery of this giant sauropod dinosaur is reported in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution.

The bright pink pigments called porphyrins are the molecular fossils of chlorophylls that were produced by ancient photosynthetic organisms inhabiting an ancient ocean that has long since vanished, said Dr. Nur Gueneli, from the Research School of Earth Sciences at the Australian National University. The molecular fossils range from blood red to deep purple in their concentrated form, and bright pink when diluted. They are approximately 600 million years older than previous ancient pigment discoveries. Dr. Gueneli and colleagues crushed the Taoudeni Basin rocks to powder, before extracting and analyzing molecules of ancient organisms from them. The precise analysis of the ancient pigments confirmed that tiny cyanobacteria dominated the base of the food chain in the oceans a billion years ago, which helps to explain why animals did not exist at the time, Dr. Gueneli explained. The emergence of large, active organisms was likely to have been restrained by a limited supply of larger food particles, such as algae, said Dr. Jochen Brocks, also from the Research School of Earth Sciences at the Australian National University. Algae, although still microscopic, are a thousand times larger in volume than cyanobacteria, and are a much richer food source. The cyanobacterial oceans started to vanish about 650 million years ago, when algae began to rapidly spread to provide the burst of energy needed for the evolution of complex ecosystems, where large animals, including humans, could thrive on Earth, he said. The results appear online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The two newly discovered Miocene species, named Theosodon arozquetai and Llullataruca shockeyi, belong to the Macraucheniidae family, a group of hoofed mammals ungulates in the extinct South American ungulate order Litopterna. Well preserved fossil material  including a partial skull, a nearly complete jaw, and a variety of bones  of the animals was recovered from several areas of outcrops of the Honda Group in western Tarija Department, southern Bolivia, that are collectively referred to as Quebrada Honda. Both Theosodon arozquetai and Llullataruca shockeyi looked similar to small moose or deer. The body mass of Theosodon arozquetai is estimated at 80 116 kg. Llullataruca shockeyi is among the smallest known macraucheniids and is estimated at 3555 kg. The discoveries, described in a paper published online May 30 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, are important because they come from the tropical latitudes of South America. These new species hint at what might be hiding in the northern parts of South America, said Andrew McGrath, a Ph.D. student at the University of California Santa Barbara. For example, close relatives of Llullataruca shockeyi disappeared from southern South America around 20 million years ago, but based on our research, we now know they were able to persist 7 million years longer in Bolivia and northern South America than in Patagonia. Studying fossils from regions such as Bolivia, where few others have looked, has allowed us discover and describe a variety of new species that are changing our views about the history of South Americas mammals, said Case Western Reserve Universitys Professor Darin Croft. Since South America was geographically isolated for most of the past 66 million years, its rich fossil record makes it a perfect location to investigate topics such as mammal adaptation, diversification, and community ecology. South America was untouched by mammals from other continents for millions of years, so the solutions its native mammals came up with were often different from those developed by mammals elsewhere, Professor Croft said. By comparing how mammals on different continents have evolved to deal with similar ecological situations, we are able to gauge which characteristics developed due to universal ecological principles and which were peculiar to a certain place and time.

Turacos, also known as banana eaters, are brightly colored medium sized fruit eating birds. They make up the bird family Musophagidae, with around 24 currently recognized species. The ancient relative of turacos, Foro panarium, was originally discovered in western North America in 1982, and named in the 1990s. However, only now has the fossil been firmly placed in its evolutionary context. Foro panarium exhibits an enigmatic mix of anatomical features that has prevented a robust assessment of its affinities, said Dr. Daniel Field of the Milner Centre for Evolution and Dr. Allison Hsiang from the Swedish Museum of Natural History. The fossil not only shows that turacos formerly resided well outside of their present geographic range, but also that early turacos had long legs, suggesting they may have been ground dwelling. All the modern turacos live in trees and have relatively short legs suited for perching on branches, Dr. Field added. The fact that their ancestors had long legs indicates they most likely lived on the ground, suggesting that turacos may have moved into the trees much later. This finding ties in with Dr. Fields recent research into how birds transitioned to tree dwelling following the asteroid strike that killed dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Dr. Field and Dr. Hsiang used the fossil record and genetic data of modern birds to trace the evolutionary tree of life for these birds. Its a really exciting time to be studying bird evolution. Modern techniques allow us to study 3D scans of fossils in great detail, and sequence large amounts of genetic data, Dr. Field said. This fossil raises almost as many questions as its answered  why are the modern descendants of these birds now restricted to the tropics when they were previously found in the Northern Hemisphere too? We think changes in climate might be partly responsible for fluctuations in the distributions of these birds, but need to study this further. The research is published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology.

Named Obamus coronatus and Attenborites janeae, the newly discovered fossil animals were part of the Ediacara biota. Obamus coronatus, a name that honors President Barack Obamas passion for science, was between 0.5 2 cm across with raised spiral grooves on its surface, explained Professor Mary Droser, from the University of California, Riverside, and co authors. This disc shaped creature did not seem to move around, rather it was embedded to the ocean mat, a thick layer of organic matter that covered the early ocean floor. Attenborites janeae, named after the English naturalist and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough for his science advocacy and support of paleontology, was less than a centimeter across. This tiny ovoid was adorned with internal grooves and ridges giving it a raisin like appearance. In the hierarchical taxonomic classification system, the Ediacara biota are not yet organized into families, and little is known about how they relate to modern animals. About 50 genera have been described, which often have only one species. The two genera that we identified are a new body plan, unlike anything else that has been described, Professor Droser said.

Brindabellaspis stensioi was first found in 1980 in limestone around Lake Burrinjuck in New South Wales, Australia, an area containing some of the worlds earliest known reef fish fauna. This was one strange looking fish, said lead author Dr. Benedict King, a researcher at the Naturalis Biodiversity Centre and Flinders University, who, with colleagues, reconstructed two new specimens of Brindabellaspis stensioi. The eyes were on top of the head, and the nostrils came out of the eye sockets. There was this long snout at the front, and the jaws were positioned very far forward. Brindabellaspis stensioi had another surprise a unique sensory system on the snout which turned out to be a modified form of the pressure sensor system found in other fish. We suspect that this animal was a bottom dweller. We imagine it used the bill to search for prey, somewhat like a platypus, while the eyes on top of the head looked out for danger from above, said Flinders Universitys Professor John Long, co author of the study. When we saw the dense sensory tubes on another broken snout, we immediately thought of the local platypus. I am very gratified there is finally an accurate reconstruction of this strange skull, said co author Dr. Gavin Young, from the Research School of Physics and Engineering at Australian National University. There are over 70 species of fish known from this ancient coral reef ecosystem, and this finding shows they came in all shapes and sizes, he added. Clearly this ancient reef was a thriving hotspot for evolution, as are the coral reefs of more recent times. The fossil re examination filled in the gaps, but not in a way anyone expected. Despite this being one of the earliest well known ecosystems including many species of fish, the inhabitants of this ancient reef were clearly not in any way primitive, Professor Long said.

According to new research, published in the journal PLoS ONE, dinosaur tongues were probably rooted to the bottoms of their mouths in a manner akin to extant alligators. Tongues are often overlooked. But, they offer key insights into the lifestyles of extinct animals, said study lead author Dr. Zhiheng Li, a researcher at the Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origins, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Dr. Li and colleagues made their discovery by comparing hyoid bones the bones that support and ground the tongue of extinct dinosaurs, pterosaurs and alligators to the hyoid bones and muscles of modern birds and alligator specimens. Hyoid bones act as anchors for the tongue in most animals, but in birds these bones can extend to the tip. Because extinct dinosaurs are related to crocodiles, pterosaurs and modern birds, comparing anatomy across these groups can help scientists understand the similarities and differences in tongue anatomy and how traits evolved through time and across different lineages. The researchers took high resolution images of hyoid muscles and bones from 15 modern specimens, including three alligators and 13 bird species as diverse as ostriches and ducks. The fossil specimens, most from northeastern China, were scrutinized for preservation of the delicate tongue bones and included a Tyrannosaurus rex, small bird like dinosaurs as well as pterosaurs. The results indicate that the hyoid bones of most dinosaurs were like those of alligators and crocodiles  short, simple and connected to a tongue that was not very mobile. The findings mean that dramatic reconstructions that show dinosaurs with tongues stretching out from between their jaws are wrong. Theyve been reconstructed the wrong way for a long time, said Professor Julia Clarke, a paleontologist at the University of Texas at Austin. In most extinct dinosaurs their tongue bones are very short. And in crocodilians with similarly short hyoid bones, the tongue is totally fixed to the floor of the mouth. In contrast to the short hyoid bones of crocodiles, the scientists found that pterosaurs, bird like dinosaurs, and living birds have a great diversity in hyoid bone shapes. The range of shapes could be related to flight ability, or in the case of flightless birds such as ostriches and emus, evolved from an ancestor that could fly, they said. Taking to the skies could have led to new ways of feeding that could be tied to diversity and mobility in tongues. Birds, in general, elaborate their tongue structure in remarkable ways. They are shocking, Professor Clarke said. That elaboration could be related to the loss of dexterity that accompanied the transformation of hands into wings, Dr. Li added. If you cant use a hand to manipulate prey, the tongue may become much more important to manipulate food. That is one of the hypotheses that we put forward. The team also noted one exception linking tongue diversity to flight. Ornithischian dinosaurs  a group that includes Triceratops, ankylosaurs and other plant eating dinosaurs that chewed their food  had hyoid bones that were highly complex and more mobile, though they were structurally different from those of flying dinosaurs and pterosaurs. Further research on other anatomical changes that occurred with shifts in tongue function could help improve our knowledge of the evolution of birds, Professor Clarke said.

Nevertheless, new finds are often made in museum collections. Upon viewing the collection of eastern North American dinosaur bones at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, Chase Brownstein, a researcher from the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, noticed peculiar marks on two bones from two legged dinosaurs called theropods that had been recovered from sites in New Jersey. One femur bore several small, slender scrapes. Another leg bone was marked with several pits, and large areas of the specimen were flaked. In addition, the second leg bone also had many smaller marks and strains that appeared as ovular and circular shapes. At least three potential biological traces on the bone were identifiable, said Brownstein, who in the past few years has been working on the fossil record of dinosaurs from eastern North America, particularly those from a period of time between about 100 and 66 million years ago called the Late Cretaceous. Those on the femur are similar to marks previously identified as shark feeding traces. The pits and flaked areas on the second bone may be indicative of the bites of ancient relatives of crocodiles, and the smaller oval and circular indentations and stains were perhaps made by invertebrates like barnacles. In addition to being another rare case of ecological interaction documented in the fossil record, the discovery of the biological marks on the dinosaur bones are also important for what they can tell us of the types of animals living along the coast of eastern North America about 68 million years ago. The marks apparently made by crocodile relatives could suggest the presence of a species currently unknown from body fossils, and the circular stains, if made by barnacles, would add to the handful of such marks known from the time of the non avian dinosaurs. The research was published June 11, 2018 in the journal PeerJ.

Four amber preserved specimens of Electrorana were acquired in the area of Angbamo in Kachin Province of northern Myanmar in 2015. They provide the earliest direct evidence of frogs living in a wet tropical forest ecosystem and are oldest known examples of frogs preserved in amber, with the only two previous reports from Cenozoic amber deposits of the Dominican Republic. Its almost unheard of to get a fossil frog from this time period that is small, has preservation of small bones and is mostly 3D. This is pretty special, said co author Dr. David Blackburn, associate curator of herpetology at the Florida Museum of Natural History. But whats most exciting about this animal is its context. These frogs were part of a tropical ecosystem that, in some ways, might not have been that different to what we find today  minus the dinosaurs. Electrorana limoae is a very small frog, about 0.8 inches 2.2 cm in snout vent length. Clearly visible in the amber are the frogs skull, its forelimbs, part of its backbone, a partial hind limb and the unidentified beetle. Electrorana raises more questions than it answers, Dr. Blackburn said. Many characteristics herpetologists use to discern details of a frogs life history and determine how its related to other frogs are either missing or were not yet fully developed in the juvenile frog. The existing bones provide clues about Electroranas possible living relatives, but the results are puzzling species that have similar features include fire bellied toads and midwife toads  Eurasian species that live in temperate, not tropical, ecosystems. The discovery of Electrorana helps add to our understanding of frogs in the Cretaceous period, showing they have inhabited wet, tropical forests for at least 99 million years, the researchers said.

It dates from the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago. The newly reported specimen is a flattened, pear shaped piece of amber with dimensions of 14 x 11 mm. It originated from the private collection of German collector Patrick M\u00fcller, and is described in the journal Cretaceous Research by Dr. Jason Dunlop of the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde in Berlin, Professor Paul Selden from the University of Kansas and the Natural History Museum, London, and their colleagues. Its a show of behavior, really. Ticks already are known from the Burmese amber  but its unusual to find one wrapped in spider silk, Professor Selden said. Were not sure if the spider wrapped it in order to eat it later or if it was to get it out of the way and stop it from wriggling and destroying its web. Thats something spiders do. This is the first time this kind of interaction between ticks and spiders has been documented in the fossil record. Ticks are seldom found in Burmese amber, though the few that have been discovered were proved to be among the oldest tick specimens known to science, Professor Selden said. Theyre rare because ticks dont crawl around on tree trunks. Amber is tree resin, so it tends to capture things that crawl around on bark or the base of the tree. But ticks tend to be on long grass or bushes, waiting for passing animals to brush up against them, though some of them can be on birds or squirrels, or maybe a little crawling dinosaur. The team took pains to ensure the ancient tick was indeed bound in spider silk, rather than fungal filaments that sometimes can grow around a dead tick. We think this was spider silk because of the angles that the threads make, Professor Selden said. Also we show a picture of a tick that started to decay  and the fungus on that tick grows from its orifices  from the inside to the outside. Whereas these threads are wrapped around externally and not concentrated at the orifices. The researchers are unable to determine the species of spider that wrapped the tick because families of spiders known to catch ticks today lack a convincing Mesozoic fossil record. We dont know what kind of spider this was, Professor Selden said. A spiders web is stretched between twigs to catch prey that flies or bumps or crawls into it. As prey gets stuck, it adheres to the web and starts to struggle. Maybe some things can escape after some struggle, so the spider rushes to it out from hiding and wraps it in swaths of silk to immobilize it, to stop it escaping or destroying the web. This prevents prey from hitting back  tinging or biting  once its wrapped in silk it cant move, and then the spider can bite it and inject gastric fluid to eat it or venom to subdue it as well.

Bilaterian animals, such as arthropods and annelids, have paired appendages, and are among the most diverse animals today and in the geological past, said co lead author Dr. Zhe Chen from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology and colleagues. They are often assumed to have appeared and radiated suddenly during the Cambrian explosion, about 541 510 million years ago, although it has long been suspected that their evolutionary ancestry was rooted in the Ediacaran period 635 541 million years ago. Until our discovery, however, no fossil record of animal appendages had been found in the Ediacaran. Dr. Chen and co authors studied trace fossils from the Ediacaran Shibantan Member 551 541 million years old of the Dengying Formation in the Yangtze Gorges area, China. These trace fossils include burrows and trackways that are preserved in close proximity and are apparently connected. The trackways are somewhat irregular, consisting of two rows of imprints that are arranged in series or repeated groups. They were probably made by millimeter sized bilaterian animals with paired appendages that raised the animal body above the water sediment interface. These trace fossils represent some of the earliest known evidence for animal appendages and extend the earliest trace fossil record of animals with appendages from the Early Cambrian to the Late Ediacaran period, the paleontologists said. The body fossils of the animals that made these traces, however, have not yet been found. Maybe they were never preserved. The study was published in the June 6, 2018 issue of the journal Science Advances.

It was caused by the impact of an asteroid in the southern Gulf of Mexico approximately 66 million years ago, forming the Chicxulub impact crater. Although the asteroid killed off species, new research has found that the crater it left behind was home to sea life less than a decade after impact, and it contained a thriving ecosystem within 30,000 years. A research team led by University of Texas Institute for Geophysics scientist Chris Lowery found the first evidence for the appearance of life two to three years after impact. By 30,000 years after impact, a thriving ecosystem was present in the Chicxulub crater, with blooming phytoplankton supporting a diverse community of organisms in the surface waters and on the seafloor. In contrast, other areas around the world, including the North Atlantic and other areas of the Gulf of Mexico, took up to 300,000 years to recover in a similar manner. We found life in the crater within a few years of impact, which is really fast, surprisingly fast. It shows that theres not a lot of predictability of recovery in general, Dr. Lowery said. The evidence comes primarily in the form of microfossils  the remains of unicellular organisms such as algae and plankton  as well as the burrows of larger organisms discovered in a rock extracted from the Chicxulub crater during recent scientific drilling conducted jointly by the International Ocean Discovery Program and International Continental Drilling Program. Microfossils let you get at this complete community picture of whats going on, Dr. Lowery said. You get a chunk of rock and theres thousands of microfossils there, so we can look at changes in the population with a really high degree of confidence and we can use that as kind of a proxy for the larger scale organisms. The core containing the fossil evidence was extracted from the Chicxulub crater during a 2016 expedition. Whereas core samples from other parts of the ocean hold only millimeters of material deposited in the moments after impact, the section from the crater used in this study contains more than 426 feet 130 m of such material, the upper 30 inches 76 cm of which settled out slowly from the turbid water. This material provides a record that captures the seafloor environment days to years after the impact. You can see layering in this core, while in others, theyre generally mixed, meaning that the record of fossils and materials is all churned up, and you cant resolve tiny time intervals, said co author Professor Timothy Bralower, of Pennsylvania State University. We have a fossil record here where were able to resolve daily, weekly, monthly, yearly changes. The relatively rapid rebound of life in the crater suggests that although the asteroid caused the extinction, it didnt hamper recovery. The researchers point to local factors, from water circulation to interactions between organisms and the availability of ecological niches, as having the most influence on a particular ecosystems recovery rate. The findings, published in the journal Nature, indicate that recovery after a global catastrophe could be a local affair.

Megachirella wachtleri is the most ancient ancestor of all modern squamates lizards, snakes and amphisbaenians. The specimen  a well preserved partial skeleton  is at least 75 million years older than the previously known oldest squamate fossils, partially filling the fossil gap in the origin of lizards. The fossil was originally found in the early 2000s in the Dolomites. Paleontologists thought it was linked to  but not an ancestor of  modern lizards and snakes. Further analysis by University of Alberta researcher Tiago Sim\u00f5es and his colleagues determined the specimen was actually the oldest relative ever found of all living lizards and snakes. This discovery provides valuable information for understanding the evolution of both living and extinct squamates, Sim\u00f5es said. To better understand both the anatomy of Megachirella wachtleri and the earliest evolution of squamates, the team assembled the largest reptile dataset ever created, using fossils and living specimens from more than 130 lizards and snakes from around the world. The data included CT scans, photographs and molecular analysis collected by the study authors, rather than relying on existing literature. They combined the new data with CT scans, revealing that Megachirella wachtleri was actually the oldest known squamate. Fossils are our only accurate window into the ancient past, said co author Professor Michael Caldwell, also from the University of Alberta. Our new understanding of Megachirella wachtleri is one point in ancient time, but it tells us things about the evolution of lizards that we simply cannot learn from any of the species of lizards and snakes alive today.

Spinosaurus meaning spine lizard was the longest, and among the largest of all known predatory dinosaurs, and possessed many adaptations for a semiaquatic lifestyle. It lived in what is now North Africa during the Cretaceous period, between 112 and 93.5 million years ago. The new specimen  the 21 mm long pedal ungual phalanx a phalanx supporting a claw of the foot  is from the smallest known individual of this giant, sail backed dinosaur. It was discovered in 1999 in the Kem Kem Beds of Tafilalt region, south eastern Morocco. This specimen remained unnoticed until the recent discovery of a partial skeleton of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus that preserves an almost complete right foot with peculiar morphology in the phalanges, said Milan Natural History Museum paleontologists Simone Maganuco and Cristiano Dal Sasso. The striking similarities with the claw phalanges of the Spinosaurus foot allowed us to identify the tiny bone to a very small and young specimen of this dinosaur, the smallest individual reported up to today. The small specimen retains the same locomotor adaptations as the large version  such as traversing soft substrates or paddling  during the entire lifespan, they added. This find indicates that in Spinosaurus, the foot of early juveniles had the same locomotor adaptations observed in large individuals, that were probably achieved early in ontogeny and retained for the entire lifespan, Dr. Dal Sasso said. Besides the rarity of the fossils belonging to juvenile theropod dinosaurs, and the rarity of Spinosaurus bones, this finding is even more remarkable if we consider the dramatic size attained by some large specimens of Spinosaurus, Dr. Maganuco added. Assuming the juveniles looked like smaller versions of the adults, the 21 mm long claw phalanx from this small specimen would pertain to an early juvenile individual, 1.78 m long, only just a little bit longer than the estimated length of the sole head of the largest adult Spinosaurus known to date, the plaeontologists said. The study was published online this week in the journal PeerJ.

An international research team led by Dr. Daniel Field of the University of Bath pieced together evidence from the plant fossil record and ecology of ancient and modern birds, and found that the only birds to survive the end Cretaceous extinction also known as the Cretaceous Paleogene, Cretaceous Tertiary or K Pg extinction lived on the ground. We drew on a variety of approaches to stitch this story together. We concluded that the temporary elimination of forests in the aftermath of the asteroid impact explains why arboreal birds failed to survive across this extinction event, Dr. Field said. The ancestors of modern arboreal birds did not move into the trees until forests had recovered from the extinction causing asteroid. Looking at the fossil record, at plants and birds, there are multiple lines of evidence suggesting that the forest canopies collapsed. Perching birds went extinct because there were no more perches, added co author Dr. Regan Dunn, a paleontologist at the Field Museum in Chicago. This study provides a large picture, ecosystem wide explanation for why certain groups did well after the extinction and set the stage for modern birds, said co author Dr. Tyler Lyson, a paleontologist at Denver Museum of Nature  Science. It is fascinating to me that an event that happened 66.02 million years ago shaped the modern world, and were able to see this through molecular data thanks to technology that wasnt even around 10 years ago. The teams analysis of the plant fossil record confirmed that global forests collapsed in the wake of the asteroids impact. Our study examined the fossil record from New Zealand, Japan, Europe and North America which showed there was a mass deforestation across the globe at the end Cretaceous boundary, explained co author Dr. Antoine Bercovici, a paleobotanist at Smithsonian Institution. This was followed by a mass colonization of so called disaster plants, such as ferns, whose spores were able to survive the asteroid hit and germinate rapidly to fill the habitats left empty by the extinction of the trees. The scientists then used the evolutionary relationships of living birds and their ecological habits to track how bird ecology has changed over the course of their evolutionary history. Those analyses showed that the most recent common ancestor of all living birds  and all bird lineages passing through the end Cretaceous extinction event  likely lived on the ground. By contrast, many birds that lived at the end of the age of dinosaurs exhibited tree dwelling habits. However, those species didnt survive the extinction event to give rise to any known modern day birds. The ancestors of modern tree dwelling birds did not move into the trees until forests had recovered from the extinction causing asteroid. Today, birds are the most diverse and globally widespread group of terrestrial vertebrate animals  there are nearly 11,000 living species, Dr. Field said. Only a handful of ancestral bird lineages succeeded in surviving the mass extinction event 66 million years ago, and all of todays amazing living bird diversity can be traced to these ancient survivors. The findings, published in the journal Current Biology, illustrate the fundamental influence of major events in Earths history on the evolutionary trajectories of major groups of organisms. In the future, the research team plans to continue to explore the precise timing of forest recovery and the early evolutionary radiation of birds.

The team discovered the fossilized skin of three feathered non avian dinosaurs Beipiaosaurus, Sinornithosaurus and Microraptor and an early bird called Confuciusornis. These creatures lived approximately 125 million years ago Early Cretaceous epoch and were important members of the famous Jehol Biota, a rich ecosystem preserved in a rock formation cropping out in several Chinese provinces. The paleontologists studied the fossilized dandruff, and dandruff from modern birds, with powerful electron microscopes. Whats remarkable is that the fossil dandruff is almost identical to that in modern birds  even the spiral twisting of individual fibers is still visible, said co lead author Dr. Maria McNamara, from the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences at University College Cork, Ireland. The fossil cells are preserved with incredible detail  right down to the level of nanoscale keratin fibrils. The 125 million year old dandruff is the first evidence of how dinosaurs shed their skin. Beipiaosaurus, Sinornithosaurus and Microraptor clearly shed their skin in flakes, like Confuciusornis and also modern birds and mammals, and not as a single piece or several large pieces, as in many modern reptiles, the researchers said. Its unusual to be able to study the skin of a dinosaur, and the fact this is dandruff proves the dinosaur was not shedding its whole skin like a modern lizard or snake but losing skin fragments from between its feathers, added co author Professor Mike Benton, from the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol, UK. Just like human dandruff, the fossil dandruff is made of tough cells called corneocytes, which in life are dry and full of the protein keratin. This modern skin feature evolved sometime in the late Middle Jurassic, around the same time as a host of other skin features evolved, the study authors said. There was a burst of evolution of feathered dinosaurs and birds at this time, and its exciting to see evidence that the skin of early birds and dinosaurs was evolving rapidly in response to bearing feathers, Dr. McNamara said. Modern birds have very fatty corneocytes with loosely packed keratin, which allows them to cool down quickly when they are flying for extended periods. The corneocytes in the fossil dinosaurs and birds, however, were packed with keratin, suggesting that the fossils didnt get as warm as modern birds, presumably because they couldnt fly at all or for as long periods.

The study appears in the journal Nature. The 130 million year old fossil skull was found at the Cedar Mountain Formation, a rock formation in Utah dated to between 139 million and 124 million years ago. It was analyzed by a group of experts from the University of Chicago, the Natural History Museum of Utah, the Utah Geological Survey, and the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. The researchers used an imaging technique called micro computed tomography to reveal  anatomical details about the skull. With an estimated body weight of up to 2.5 pounds 0.9 kg, the ancient creature  named Cifelliodon wahkarmoosuch  would seem small compared to many living mammals, but it was a giant among its Cretaceous contemporaries, they said. A full grown Cifelliodon wahkarmoosuch was probably about the size of a small hare or pika small mammal with rounded ears, short limbs and a very small tail. It had teeth similar to fruit eating bats and could nip, shear and crush. It might have incorporated plants into its diet. The animal had a relatively small brain and giant olfactory bulbs to process sense of smell. The skull had tiny eye sockets, so the animal probably did not have good eyesight or color vision. It possibly was nocturnal and depended on sense of smell to root out food. For a long time, we thought early mammals from the Cretaceous were anatomically similar and not ecologically diverse, said study lead author Dr. Adam Huttenlocker, from the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles. This finding by our team and others reinforce that, even before the rise of modern mammals, ancient relatives of mammals were exploring specialty niches insectivores, herbivores, carnivores, swimmers, gliders. Basically, they were occupying a variety of niches that we see them occupy today. The scientists also found that Cifelliodon wahkarmoosuch belonged to a long lived and widespread group of early mammal relatives called Haramiyida. These early mammal relatives included the closest relatives of the common ancestor of all true living mammals. The fossil was the first of its particular subgroup  Hahnodontidae  found in North America. This subgroup was previously known only from the Cretaceous of Northern Africa. Based on the unlikely discovery of this near complete fossil cranium, we now recognize a new, cosmopolitan group of early mammal relatives, Dr. Huttenlocker said. The fossil discovery emphasizes that haramiyidans and some other vertebrate groups existed globally during the Jurassic Cretaceous transition. It suggests that the divide of the ancient landmass Pangaea continued for about 15 million years later than previously thought and that mammal migration and that of their close relatives continued during the Early Cretaceous 145 to 101 million years ago. Its generally thought that the northern and southern continents, as well as Europe and North America, were completely separated by the end of the Jurassic period about 145 million years ago, Dr. Huttenlocker said. The problem is that the earliest Cretaceous record is not as well studied in North America or in Africa, making it difficult to compare continental vertebrate assemblages. Based on intense fieldwork taking place now in the basal Cretaceous of Utah and in Europe, there is evidence of a North Atlantic Land Bridge that may have connected the Old and New Worlds into the Cretaceous. Shared dinosaur groups found in Africa and Europe further present the possibility that similar connections existed between the southern and northern continents, transforming our understanding of the timing and order of the Pangaean supercontinents breakup. The study reveals that the early mammal precursors migrated from Asia to Europe, into North America and further onto major Southern continents, added senor author Professor Zhe Xi Luo, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago.

I think this will change peoples ideas. It will be a data point that is picked up and used in other work where researchers are trying to find the time of the evolution of major groups of flowering plants, said Professor David Dilcher, from the Department of Geology at Indiana University, Bloomington. Previous fossil evidence had suggested the Convolvulaceae family may have originated in North America about 35 million years ago. But molecular analyses had supported the idea that it originated earlier and in the Old World. The new research provides evidence for that conclusion. The discovery also suggests Convolvulaceae and its sister nightshade family Solanaceae, which includes potatoes and tomatoes, diverged earlier than previously thought. Together with the recent, separate discovery of 52 million year old nightshade fossils in Argentina, it suggests that morning glories developed in the East and nightshades in the West. The 17 fossils analyzed in the study are the earliest recorded fossils for both Convolvulaceae and the order Solanales, which includes morning glories and nightshades. Morning glory fossils are rare because the plants soft structure was not easily preserved in rocks. Professor Dilcher and his colleagues, Gaurav Srivastava and Rakesh C. Mehrotra of the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences in Lucknow, India, found the fossils in the Tura Formation exposed in Nangwalbibra, East Garo Hills District, Meghalaya. The researchers used microscopic analysis of the shape and structure of the leaves, comparing details of the leaf veins and cells with plants in the genus Ipomoea. This genus includes sweet potato but also hundreds of other plants, most of which dont produce food for humans. We dont know that these were sweet potatoes. We cant say there were delicious sweet potatoes there. There may have been, or there may not, Professor Dilcher said.

Dubbed Magyarosuchus fitosi, the ancient crocodile lived during the Early Jurassic epoch in the Mediterranean region of the Tethys Ocean. It is what paleontologists called a crocodyliform, part of a group known as the crocodilians that includes extant alligators and caimans. The incomplete skeleton of Magyarosuchus fitosi was unearthed in Gerecse Mountains in north west Hungary in 1996. It was analyzed by Dr. Mark Young from the University of Edinburgh and his colleagues from Hungary and Germany. Magyarosuchus fitosi was one of the largest coastal predators of the Jurassic period, the paleontologists said. It was\u00a015.3 15.9 feet 4.67 4.83 m long and had large, pointed teeth for grasping prey. It also shared key body features seen in two distinct families of prehistoric crocodiles. Some Jurassic era crocodiles had bony armor on their backs and bellies, and limbs adapted for walking on land another group had tail fins and flippers but did not have armor. Magyarosuchus fitosi was heavily armored but also had a tail fin, suggesting it is a missing link between the two groups. This fossil provides a unique insight into how crocodiles began evolving into dolphin and killer whale like forms more than 180 million years ago, Dr. Young explained. The presence of both bony armor and a tail fin highlights the remarkable diversity of Jurassic era crocodiles. The research on Magyarosuchus fitosi is published May 10 in the journal PeerJ.

Baleen whales are the largest animals on Earth, thanks to their ability to filter huge volumes of small prey from seawater using comb like baleen in their mouths. But the new evidence, based on the analysis of a skull of Llanocetus denticrenatus the second oldest baleen whale known to date, suggests that early whales had well developed gums, but no baleen. Llanocetus denticrenatus is an ancient relative of our modern gentle giants, like humpback and blue whales. Unlike them, however, it had teeth, and probably was a formidable predator, said Dr. Felix Marx, a paleontologist with the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. Until recently, it was thought that filter feeding first emerged when whales still had teeth. Llanocetus denticrenatus shows that this was not the case, added Dr. R. Ewan Fordyce, from the University of Otago, New Zealand. Like modern whales, Llanocetus denticrenatus had distinctive grooves on the roof of its mouth, which usually contain blood vessels that supply the baleen. In the ancient whale, however, those grooves cluster around tooth sockets, where baleen would have been useless and at risk of being crushed. Instead of a filter, it seems that Llanocetus denticrenatus simply had large gums and, judging from the way its teeth are worn, mainly fed by biting large prey. Even so, it was huge at a total body length of around 8 m, it rivals some living whales in size, Dr. Marx said. The findings suggest that large gums in whales like Llanocetus denticrenatus gradually became more complex over evolutionary time and, ultimately, gave rise to baleen. That transition probably happened only after the teeth had already been lost and whales had switched from biting to sucking in small prey  as many whales and dolphins now do. The study authors suggest that baleen most likely arose as a way to keep such small prey inside the mouth more effectively. The giants of our modern ocean may be gentle, but their ancestors were anything but, Dr. Marx said. Llanocetus denticrenatus was both large and a ferocious predator and probably had little in common with how modern whales behave.

The sloth tracks \u00a01.2 to 2 inches 3 5 cm deep, 12 to 22 inches 30 56 cm long, and 4 to 14 inches 10 35 cm wide  are readily distinguished from human tracks based on their elongated kidney shaped tracks and claw marks. The White Sands trackway shows that someone followed a sloth, purposely stepping in their tracks as they did so, said team member David Bustos, naturalist with the National Park Service. The ancient humans stalked the sloth, added team leader Professor Matthew Bennett, of Bournemouth University, UK. We see interesting circles of sloth tracks in these stalked trackways which we call flailing circles. These record the rise of the sloth on its hind legs and the swing of its fore legs presumably in a defensive motion. At 7 8 feet 2.1 2.4 m tall, tightly muscled and swinging fore legs tipped with wolverine like claws, the sloth would tear apart any hunter on direct approach. But in addition to tracks of humans following the sloth, there are more human tracks a safe distance away telling the scientists that this was a community action making use of distraction and misdirection to gain the upper hand in close quarter combat. The tracks show the sloth was turning and swinging at the stalker, Professor Bennett said. We also see human tracks on tip toes approach these circles was this someone approaching with stealth to deliver a killer blow while the sloth was being distracted? We believe so. It was also a family affair as we see lots of evidence of childrens tracks and assembled crowds along the edge of the flat playa. Piecing the puzzle we can see how sloth were kept on the flat playa by a horde of people and distracted by a hunter stalking the sloth from behind, while another crept forward and tried to strike the killing blow as the animal turned. The thing that is special about these prints and sets them apart from any other fossil trackways in the world is that this discovery records the interaction between humans and Ice Age giant megafauna, and White Sands National Monument has the largest concentration of human and Ice Age giant megafauna prints in the Americas, Bustos said. The Ice Age ended about 11,700 years ago and the fossil record of giant ground sloths indicates they were extinct by this time. At White Sands, the team used an approach called relative dating to estimate a minimum age for the fossils. Since the footprints are contemporaneous with animals that died out by the end of the Pleistocene, relative dating tells us those footprints are at least 11,700 years old, or older, said team member Vincent Santucci, senior paleontologist of the National Park Service. The findings were published online this week in the journal Science Advances.

The formal species description of Mandasuchus tanyauchen is published in a special memoir of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. A cousin of modern day crocodiles, Mandasuchus tanyauchen was an archosaur  the lineage of reptiles that include dinosaurs, crocodiles and birds. The ancient reptile lived around 245 million years ago Triassic period and grew up to 10 feet 3 m in length. The fossilized remains of Mandasuchus tanyauchen were first discovered in the 1930s as part of a major paleontological expedition to East Africa, which included work on a geological formation in Tanzania called the Manda Beds. The fossils in these beds date from the Middle Triassic epoch. This was a time when the archosaurs began their rise to dominance. English paleontologist Alan Charig proposed the name Mandasuchus for this species in the 1950s, when he studied the Tanzanian fossils as part of his PhD thesis. Charig continued his career in paleontology, but never completed his work on this reptile. In recent years, new expeditions to Tanzania have found additional fossils, which have remained in Tanzania. Combined with the older discoveries, these are shedding light on exciting topics such as early dinosaur evolution. Studies like these highlight the important role that museums play as storehouses of information of the natural world, said senior author Professor Paul Barrett, a paleontologist in the Department of Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museum, London. Although it took decades to complete this work, the specimens remained safe and accessible in our collections and now form the basis of this amazing new species. "}, {"title": " Mid-Carnian Mass Extinction Paved Way for Dinosaur Expansion", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 17, 2018", "doc": "Paleontologists believe that all non avian dinosaurs were wiped out when a giant asteroid or comet collided with Earth some 65 million years ago, resulting in huge clouds of dust that blocked the Suns rays from reaching Earths surface. But the origins of dinosaurs have been less understood. In a new study, published in the journal Nature Communications, researchers argue that dinosaurs diversified explosively in the mid Carnian, at a time of major climate and floral change and the extinction of key plant eaters, which the dinosaurs opportunistically replaced. In the new study, evidence is provided to match the two events the mid Carnian extinction known as the Carnian Pluvial Episode, or CPE and the initial diversification of dinosaurs. Dinosaurs had originated much earlier, at the beginning of the Triassic period, some 245 million years ago, but they remained very rare until the shock events of CPE 13 million years later. The study shows just when dinosaurs took over by using detailed evidence from rock sequences in the Dolomites, in north Italy  here the dinosaurs are detected from their footprints. First there were no dinosaur tracks, and then there were many. This marks the moment of their explosion, and the rock successions in the Dolomites are well dated. Comparison with rock successions in Argentina and Brazil, here the first extensive skeletons of dinosaurs occur, show the explosion happened at the same time there as well. We were excited to see that the footprints and skeletons told the same story, said study lead author Dr. Massimo Bernardi, from the MUSE Museo delle Scienze in Trento, Italy, and the University of Bristol, UK. We had been studying the footprints in the Dolomites for some time, and its amazing how clear cut the change from no dinosaurs to all dinosaurs was. The point of explosion of dinosaurs matches the end of the CPE event, a time when climates shuttled from dry to humid and back to dry again. It was long suspected that CPE had caused upheavals among life on land and in the sea, but the details were not clear. Then, in 2015, dating of rock sections and measurement of oxygen and carbon values showed just what had happened. There were massive eruptions in western Canada, represented today by the great Wrangellia basalts  these drove bursts of global warming, acid rain, and killing on land and in the oceans. We had detected evidence for the climate change in the Dolomites. There were four pulses of warming and climate perturbation, all within a million years or so. This must have led to repeated extinctions, said co author Dr. Piero Gianolla, from the University of Ferrara, Italy. The discovery of the existence of a link between the first diversification of dinosaurs and a global mass extinction is important, said co author Professor Mike Benton, from the University of Bristol. The extinction didnt just clear the way for the age of the dinosaurs, but also for the origins of many modern groups, including lizards, crocodiles, turtles, and mammals  key land animals today.

Named Tratayenia rosalesi by its discoverers, the dinosaur was a member of Megaraptoridae, a group of carnivorous dinosaurs that terrorized South America and Australia during the middle and late stages of the Cretaceous period. The ancient creature may be the geologically youngest megaraptorid dinosaur yet found anywhere in the world, showing that these predators survived until at least 85 million years ago. Not many megaraptorid specimens are known, so we thought the new fossil would provide important information on these enigmatic predators, said Dr. Domenica dos Santos, from of the Museo de Ciencias Naturales of the Universidad Nacional del Comahue, Argentina. Patagonian discoveries such as Tratayenia rosalesi are expanding our knowledge of the spectacular but still mysterious dinosaurs of the Southern Hemisphere, added Dr. Rub\u00e9n Ju\u00e1rez Valieri, from the Museo Provincial Carlos Ameghino, Argentina. Tratayenia rosalesi is the first member of Megaraptoridae to preserve the complete series of hip vertebrae, and as such, it lends insight into the anatomy of this part of the skeleton in these little known Cretaceous carnivores. The vertebrae of\u00a0Tratayenia rosalesi are about as gorgeous as dinosaur fossils get, and theyve got some pretty weird features to boot, said Dr. Matt Lamanna, from Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. We definitely wish we had more of this thing, but what we do have is awesome. Thanks to discoveries such as Tratayenia rosalesi, paleontologists are closer than ever to understanding what megaraptorids looked like and how they behaved. These dinosaurs had proportionally long, low skulls lined with many sharp, serrated teeth bones that were chock full of air pockets like those of their modern relatives, birds and most strikingly, long, powerfully muscled forelimbs that were tipped with gigantic talons on the innermost two fingers of each hand. They grew to over 30 feet 9 m in length and were the biggest, deadliest predators in southern South America from about 95 to 85 million years ago. They used their enormous hand claws to catch and subdue prey, including other dinosaurs. Megaraptorid claws are the stuff of nightmares  razor sharp meat hooks more than a foot long. Wolverine from the X Men has nothing on these guys, Dr. Lamanna noted. Still, paleontologists have much left to learn about megaraptorids. For one thing, their evolutionary relationships to other carnivorous dinosaurs are poorly understood, with some researchers arguing that megaraptorids are related to even larger Southern Hemisphere carnivores such as Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus, whereas others contend that megaraptorids are close cousins of Tyrannosaurus rex. Though Tratayenia rosalesi does not help to solve this particular riddle, an answer may well be in sight. Tratayenia rosalesi is just one of many exciting megaraptorid fossils that have been found in recent years, Dr. Porfiri said. After these specimens are studied, many questions surrounding these puzzling carnivorous creatures may finally be answered. Details of the dinosaurs discovery are published in the journal Cretaceous Research.

Remarkable scales of lepidopterans moths and butterflies exhibit complex structures, many of which produce structural colors that are the basis for diverse communication strategies. Little is known, however, about the early evolution of lepidopteran scales and their photonic structures. Dr. Tim Starkey, a researcher in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Exeter, and colleagues examined fossilized remains of lepidopterans from the United Kingdom, Germany, Kazakhstan, and China, and tarachopterans a stem group of Amphiesmenoptera from mid Cretaceous Burmese amber. Using scanning electron microscopy SEM, transmission electron microscopy TEM and confocal laser scanning microscopy CLSM and using optical models, they found microscopic ridges and grooves in the insects wing scales, similar to those seen in todays moths. The models revealed these tiny features are photonic structures that would have produced metallic bronze to golden color appearances in the insect wings. The structural colors of the fossils studied by the team resulted from light scattering by intricate microstructures, extending the evidence for these light scattering structures in the insect fossil record by more than 130 million years. The structural colors exhibited by butterflies and moths have been a longstanding research interest in Exeter, and have helped us develop biologically inspired optical technologies for the present day, Dr. Starkey said. However, in this study weve looked millions of years back in time to early origins of such colors in nature, to understand how and when the evolution of colors in these insects took place. Remarkably, these fossils are among the oldest known representatives of butterflies and moths, said co author Dr. Maria McNamara, from the University College Cork, Ireland. We didnt expect to find wing scales preserved, let alone microscopic structures that produce color. This tells us that color was an important driving force in shaping the evolution of wings even in the earliest ancestors of butterflies and moths. Uniquely in this study, we show that impression fossils, i.e. wing prints, are equally as capable as compression fossils at preserving the structure of scales in sufficient detail to elucidate the moths 180 million year old colors, said co author Dr. Luke McDonald, also from the University College Cork. The findings appear in the journal Science Advances.

Fossil collector Paul de la Salle found the 205 million year old Late Triassic epoch specimen on the beach at Lilstock, Somerset, in May 2016. Paleontologists Dean Lomax from the University of Manchester and Professor Judy Massare of SUNY College at Brockport identified it as an incomplete bone  called a surangular  from the lower jaw of a giant ichthyosaur. The researchers estimate the length of this specimens body would have been up to 85 feet 26 m  almost the size of a blue whale. They also compared the specimen with several ichthyosaur species, including the largest ichthyosaur known  the shastasaurid Shonisaurus sikanniensis, which is 69 feet 21 m long. They found similarities between the new specimen and Shonisaurus sikanniensis which suggest the Lilstock bone belongs to a giant shastasaurid like ichthyosaur. As the specimen is represented only by a large piece of jaw, it is difficult to provide a size estimate, but by using a simple scaling factor and comparing the same bone in Shonisaurus sikanniensis, the Lilstock specimen is about 25 larger, the paleontologists said. Other comparisons suggest the Lilstock ichthyosaur was at least 65 82 feet 20 25 m. Of course, such estimates are not entirely realistic because of differences between species, Lomax said. Nonetheless, simple scaling is commonly used to estimate size, especially when comparative material is scarce. In 1850, a large bone was described from the Late Triassic 208 million years old of Aust Cliff, Gloucestershire, UK. Four other similarly incomplete bones were also found and described. Two of them are now missing and presumed destroyed. They have been identified as the limb bones of several dinosaurs stegosaurs and sauropods, indeterminate dinosaurs and other reptiles. However, with the discovery of the Lilstock specimen, this new study refutes previous identifications and also the most recent assertion that the Aust bones represent an early experiment of dinosaur like gigantism in terrestrial reptiles. They are, in fact, jaw fragments of giant, previously unrecognized ichthyosaurs. One of the Aust bones might also be an ichthyosaur surangular. If it is, by comparison with the Lilstock specimen, it might represent a much larger animal, Lomax said. To verify these findings, we need a complete giant Triassic ichthyosaur from the UK  a lot easier said than done.

The tracks were made by massive dinosaurs some 170 million years ago Middle Jurassic period, in a muddy, shallow lagoon. The site preserves an abundance of small sauropod v and several isolated and broken medium to large theropod footprints. The trackmakers of sauropod prints are estimated to have stood\u00a05 8.2 feet 1.5 2.5 m at the hip  fairly large, but not as colossal as famous species like Brontosaurus, Diplodocus and Brachiosaurus. In addition to the sauropod tracks, several theropod tracks are present at the site. These tracks reflect medium sized individuals  with estimated hip heights ranging from\u00a02.9 to 7 feet 0.87 2.13 m  that spent some time in the same lagoonal environment as the small sauropods. The more we look on the Isle of Skye, the more dinosaur footprints we find, said team member Dr. Steve Brusatte, from the School of Geosciences at the University of Edinburgh. This new site records two different types of dinosaurs  long necked cousins of Brontosaurus and sharp toothed cousins of Tyrannosaurus rex  hanging around a shallow lagoon, back when Scotland was much warmer and dinosaurs were beginning their march to global dominance. The find is globally important as it is rare evidence of the Middle Jurassic, from which few fossil sites have been found around the world. This tracksite is the second discovery of sauropod footprints on Skye, said team member Paige dePolo, also from the University of Edinburghs School of Geosciences. It was found in rocks that were slightly older than those previously found at Duntulm on the island and demonstrates the presence of sauropods in this part of the world through a longer timescale than previously known. This site is a useful building block for us to continue fleshing out a picture of what dinosaurs were like on Skye in the Middle Jurassic. The researchers measured, photographed and analyzed about 50 footprints at the site. The footprints were difficult to study owing to tidal conditions, the impact of weathering and changes to the landscape. In spite of this, the team identified two trackways in addition to many isolated footprints. The teams results were published in the Scottish Journal of Geology. "}, {"title": " Eocene Monitor Lizard Had Four Eyes: Study", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 3, 2018", "doc": "According to a new study, Saniwa ensidens  an extinct monitor lizard that lived in what is now Wyoming 51 49 million years ago Eocene epoch  had four eyes, a first among known jawed vertebrates. The third and fourth eyes refer to pineal and parapineal organs, eye like photosensory structures on the top of the head that play key roles in orientation and in circadian and annual cycles. The photosensitive pineal organ is found in a number of lower vertebrates such as fishes and frogs. Its often referred to as the third eye and was widespread in primitive vertebrates, said lead author Dr. Krister Smith, a researcher with the Senckenberg Research Institute in Germany. On the one hand, there was this idea that the third eye was simply reduced independently in many different vertebrate groups such as mammals and birds and is retained only in lizards among fully land dwelling vertebrates. On the other hand, there was this idea that the lizard third eye developed from a different organ, called the parapineal, which is well developed in lampreys. These two ideas didnt really cohere. By discovering a four eyed lizard  in which both pineal and parapineal organs formed an eye on the top of the head  we could confirm that the lizard third eye really is different from the third eye of other jawed vertebrates, he said. Dr. Smith and co authors got the idea that the fossilized lizards might have a fourth eye after other experts came to contradictory conclusions about where the lizards third eye was located. The first question to explore the wacky idea of a lizard with four eyes was, does this unusual feature occur in more than one individual of the same age? Dr. Smith said. We turned to museum specimens collected nearly 150 years ago at Grizzly Buttes as part of the Yale College Expedition to the Bridger Basin, Wyoming. And, it turned out that the answer to their question was yes. CT scans showed that two different individuals of Saniwa ensidens a fossil sister lineage of the extant genus Varanus had spaces where a fourth eye would have been, which I certainly did not expect. The evidence confirms that the pineal and parapineal glands werent a pair of organs in the way that vertebrate eyes are. The third eye of lizards evolved independently of the third eye in other vertebrate groups, according to the team. While theres nothing mystical about the pineal and parapineal organs, they do enable extraordinary abilities, Dr. Smith said. For instance, they allow some lower vertebrates to sense the polarization of light and use that information to orient themselves geographically. Scientists still have a lot to learn about the evolution of these organs and their functions in living animals. The findings were published in the April 2, 2018 issue of the journal Current Biology. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Discover New Reptile from Triassic Period", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 26, 2018", "doc": "A team of paleontologists from Yale University, Smithsonian Institution and Johns Hopkins University has discovered a new species of reptile that lived 200 million years ago during the Triassic period, in what is now Connecticut in the United States. Dubbed Colobops noviportensis, the ancient reptile had exceptionally large jaw muscles  setting it apart from other reptiles at the time. Colobops noviportensis would have been a diminutive but plucky little beast, part of a little known menagerie of small animals that lived among the first dinosaurs, said Dr. Bhart Anjan Bhullar, from Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Department of Geology and Geophysics at Yale University. Its tiny frame hid some big secrets. Despite its lizard like aspect, it is in fact an early branch off of the lineage leading to dinosaurs and birds. Also, its little jaws could bite harder than anything else its size. Perhaps that big bite allowed it to feed on tough, armored prey impervious to weaker mouths.  Dr. Bhullar and colleagues analyzed a very small partial skull total length\u2009\u20092.5\u2009cm of Colobops noviportensis from the Upper Triassic New Haven Arkose of Connecticut. The skull was initially discovered during roadwork in 1965. It has been part of the collections of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History for decades, said Dr. Adam Pritchard, from the Smithsonian Institution. In the 1990s, the skull was subject to initial study in which it was identified as a cousin of a modern lizard like reptile called a tuatara. Our study ups the ante again, using advanced CT scanning and 3D modeling to reveal all kinds of new features of the skull. The features are very distinctive, allowing us to establish a new species. The team did a 3D reconstruction of Colobops noviportensiss skull and discovered that it showed specialization in the jaw that was unprecedented in any other known small tetrapod, juvenile or adult. Comparisons with modern reptile dissections showed that it had incredibly well developed jaw muscles for its size, suggesting an exceptional bite, even compared to the diversity of modern reptiles, Dr. Pritchard said. Its a great illustration of the critical importance of fossils big and small for understanding the diversity of organisms. The discovery, reported in the journal Nature Communications, means modern vertebrates originated in a world that was already populated by small and large bodied physical extremes, in terms of how animals physically adapted to their environment. "}, {"title": " Archaeopteryx Was Active Flyer, Paleontologists Say", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 14, 2018", "doc": "Archaeopteryx is an iconic fossil species with feathered wings from the Late Jurassic of Germany. The question of whether this dino bird was an elaborately feathered ground dweller, a glider, or an active flyer has fascinated paleontologists for many years. European Synchrotron Radiation Facility researcher Dennis Voeten and colleagues have now analyzed new data from three Archaeopteryx specimens and found that the wing bones of the ancient creature were shaped for incidental active flight, but not for the advanced style of flying mastered by modern day birds. Was Archaeopteryx capable of flying, and if so, how? Although it is common knowledge that modern day birds descended from extinct dinosaurs, many questions on their early evolution and the development of avian flight remain unanswered. Traditional research methods have thus far been unable to answer the question whether Archaeopteryx flew or not. Using synchrotron microtomography to probe inside Archaeopteryx fossils, Dr. Voeten and co authors shed new light on this earliest of birds. Reconstructing extinct behavior poses substantial challenges for paleontologists, especially when it comes to enigmatic animals such as Archaeopteryx. This well preserved fossil species shows a mosaic anatomy that illustrates the close family relations between extinct raptorial dinosaurs and the birds. Most modern bird skeletons are highly specialized for powered flight, yet many of their characteristic adaptations in particularly the shoulder are absent in Archaeopteryx specimens. Although its feathered wings resemble those of modern birds flying overhead every day, the primitive shoulder structure is incompatible with the modern avian wing beat cycle. The cross sectional architecture of limb bones is strongly influenced by evolutionary adaptation towards optimal strength at minimal mass, and functional adaptation to the forces experienced during life, said Professor Jorge Cubo, from the Sorbonne University, France. By statistically comparing the bones of living animals that engage in observable habits with those of cryptic fossils, it is possible to bring new information into an old discussion, added Dr. Sophie Sanchez, from Uppsala University, Sweden. Archaeopteryx skeletons are preserved in and on limestone slabs that reveal only part of their morphology. Since these fossils are among the most valuable in the world, invasive probing to reveal obscured or internal structures is therefore highly discouraged. Fortunately, today it is no longer necessary to damage precious fossils, said Dr. Paul Tafforeau, of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The exceptional sensitivity of X ray imaging techniques for investigating large specimens offers harmless microscopic insight into fossil bones and allows virtual 3D reconstructions of extraordinary quality. Scanning data unexpectedly revealed that Archaeopteryxs wing bones, contrary to its shoulder girdle, shared important adaptations with those of modern flying birds. We focused on the middle part of the arm bones because we knew those sections contain clear flight related signals in birds, said Dr. Emmanuel de Margerie, from CNRS, France. We immediately noticed that the bone walls of Archaeopteryx were much thinner than those of earthbound dinosaurs but looked a lot like conventional bird bones, Dr. Voeten said. Data analysis furthermore demonstrated that the bones of Archaeopteryx plot closest to those of birds like pheasants that occasionally use active flight to cross barriers or dodge predators, but not to those of gliding and soaring forms such as many birds of prey and some seabirds that are optimized for enduring flight. We know that the region around Solnhofen in southeastern Germany was a tropical archipelago, and such an environment appears highly suitable for island hopping or escape flight, said Dr. Martin R\u00f6per, from the B\u00fcrgermeister M\u00fcller Museum and the Bayerische Staatssammlung f\u00fcr Pal\u00e4ontologie und Geologie, Germany. Archaeopteryx shared the Jurassic skies with primitive pterosaurs that would ultimately evolve into the gigantic pterosaurs of the Cretaceous. We found similar differences in wing bone geometry between primitive and advanced pterosaurs as those between actively flying and soaring birds, said Dr. Vincent Beyrand, from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The findings are published in the journal Nature Communications. "}, {"title": " Permian Reptiles Could Detach Their Tails to Escape from Predators", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 7, 2018", "doc": "A new study shows how a group of ancient reptiles called captorhinids could detach their tails to avoid predation. Captorhinids, also known as cotylosaurs, are a group of small to very large lizard like reptiles. They first occured in the Late Carboniferous of North America. In Late Permian times they gained a near global distribution but dissapeared from the North American fossil record, and finally they became extinct by the end of the Permian. As small omnivores and herbivores, captorhinids had to scrounge for food while avoiding being preyed upon by large carnivorous amphibians and early mammals. One of the ways captorhinids could do this was by having breakable tail vertebrae, said study first author Aaron LeBlanc, a Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto Mississauga. Like many present day lizard species, such as skinks, that can detach their tails to escape or distract a predator, the middle of many tail vertebrae had cracks in them. It is likely that these cracks acted like the perforated lines between two paper towel sheets, allowing vertebrae to break in half along planes of weakness. If a predator grabbed hold of one of these reptiles, the vertebra would break at the crack and the tail would drop off, allowing the captorhinid to escape relatively unharmed, said University of Toronto Mississaugas Professor Robert Reisz, senior author on the study. Being the only reptiles with such an escape strategy may have been a key to their success, because they were the most common reptiles of their time, and by the end of the Permian period 251 million years ago, captorhinids had dispersed across the supercontinent Pangea, the paleontologists said. This trait disappeared from the fossil record when these reptiles died out it re evolved in lizards only 70 million years ago. The researchers were able to examine more than 70 tail vertebrae both juveniles and adults and partial tail skeletons with splits that ran through their vertebrae. They compared these skeletons to those of other reptilian relatives of captorhinids, but it appears that this ability is restricted to this family of reptiles in the Permian period. Using various paleontological and histological techniques, the team discovered that the cracks were features that formed naturally as the vertebrae were developing. Interestingly, the scientists found that young captorhinids had well formed cracks, while those in some adults tended to fuse up. This makes sense, since predation is much greater on young individuals and they need this ability to defend themselves. The study was published online this week in the journal Scientific Reports.

Microbes were the first life forms on Earth, said lead author Dr. Therese Sallstedt, from the Department of Paleobiology at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, and colleagues. They turned our planet into a tolerable environment for plants and animals and thus their activity paved the way for life as we know it today. Some of these early microbes were cyanobacteria that thrived in early shallow waters. They produced oxygen by photosynthesis, and sometimes the oxygen got trapped as bubbles within sticky microbial mats. Dr. Sallstedts team studied fossilized sediments from central India and found round spheres in the microbial mats. These bubbles were created by tiny microbes in what was once a shallow sea somewhere on the young Earth, according to the researchers. We interpret them as oxygen bubbles created in cyanobacterial biomats in shallow waters 1.6 billion years ago, Dr. Sallstedt said. Cyanobacteria changed the face of the Earth irreversibly since they were responsible for oxygenating the atmosphere. Simultaneously they constructed stromatolites, which still exist on Earth today, the paleontologists said. We now think that cyanobacteria played a larger role than previously believed in creating phosphorites in shallow waters, thereby allowing todays scientists a unique window into ancient ecosystems. The teams findings were published in the March 2018 issue of the journal Geobiology.

The 127 million year old fossil is a chick from a group of prehistoric birds called Enantiornithes. The specimen consists of a nearly complete skeleton the feet, most of its hands, and the tip of the tail are the only missing parts. It measures less than 2 inches 5 cm and would have weighed just 10 g when it was alive. It is amongst the smallest known Mesozoic avian fossils ever discovered. What makes this fossil so important and unique is the fact it died not long after its birth. This is a critical stage in a birds skeletal formation. That means this birds extremely short life has given paleontologists a rare chance to analyze the species bone structure and development. Studying and analyzing ossification  the process of bone development  can explain a lot about a young birds life, said University of Manchester researcher Dr. Fabien Knoll and colleagues. It can help us understand everything from whether it could fly or if it needed to stay with its parents after hatching or could survive on its own. The evolutionary diversification of birds has resulted in a wide range of hatchling developmental strategies and important differences in their growth rates. By analyzing bone development we can look at a whole host of evolutionary traits, Dr. Knoll said. With the fossil being so small we used synchrotron radiation to picture the tiny specimen at a submicron level, observing the bones microstructures in extreme detail. The scientists found the baby birds sternum breastplate bone was still largely made of cartilage and had not yet developed into hard, solid bone when it died, meaning it wouldnt have been able to fly. The patterns of ossification observed in this and the other few very young enantiornithine birds known to date also suggest that the developmental strategies of this particular group of ancient avians may have been more diverse than previously thought. However, its lack of bone development doesnt necessarily mean the hatchling was over reliant on its parents for care and feeding, a trait known as being altricial, the study authors said. Modern day species like love birds are highly dependent on their parents when born. Others, like chickens, are highly independent, which is known as precocial. Although, this is not a black and white issue, but rather a spectrum, hence the difficulty in clarifying the developmental strategies of long gone bird species. This new discovery, together with others from around the world, allows us to peek into the world of ancient birds that lived during the age of dinosaurs. It is amazing to realize how many of the features we see among living birds had already been developed more than 100 million years ago, said Dr. Luis Chiappe, from the LA Museum of Natural History. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.

Named Trachemys haugrudi, the ancient reptile was a fairly small turtle, not more than 10 inches 25 cm in total shell length, smaller than the extant red eared slider turtle Trachemys scripta elegans. It lived in what is now eastern Tennessee around the Miocene Pliocene boundary, about 5.5 million years ago. The Gray Fossil Site represents an ancient sinkhole surrounded by a forest from which dozens of fossil animal species have been characterized, including new species of red panda, Eurasian badger, kinosternid turtle, and colubrid snake. Thorough examination of the dozens of turtle fossils from the site revealed important differences between Trachemys haugrudi and other known fossil and living species. Turtles are best known for their shells, and indeed it is this feature of their anatomy that is commonly found as fossils. Yet the fossil shells are typically found in broken pieces, Jasinski explained. Often gaps or holes remain, or only single small pieces are found, and the whole must be inferred from other information, including other fossil and living creatures. It is extremely rare to get more complete fossils, but Trachemys haugrudi, commonly called Haugruds slider turtle, provides me with dozens of shells, and several are nearly complete. As part of the study, Jasinski sought to determine where Trachemys haugrudi was positioned in the evolution of similar turtles both within the genus and in related genera. The scientist found Trachemys haugrudi to be most closely related to a group of fossil Trachemys turtles from Florida and next most closely related to a distinct group of fossil Trachemys from the Midwestern United States. Together, these fossil Trachemys form a closely related group situated within other still living species of Trachemys. Today, distinct, closely related groups of Trachemys species dwell in Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. Jasinskis investigation, along with other information from previous studies, indicates that one group evolved in Mexico and Central and South America and evolved into different species within this geographic area, and another group evolved separately in the Caribbean. Species from the United States, including the red eared slider turtle, are found near the base of their branch of the Trachemys family tree their fossil ancestors are still waiting to be discovered. The fossil Trachemys species in this study are on a distinct part of the Trachemys tree, and current understanding suggests that they did not give rise to the modern species living today. The findings imply that there was once much greater diversity in Trachemys turtles than exists today. It seems that many of the ancient slider species died out without leaving any direct descendents, perhaps because they lacked the ability to adapt to different environments. While Trachemys turtle species are considered plastic, implying they can adapt to and live in many environments, this adaptive lifestyle may be a relatively newer characteristic of these turtles, Jasinski explained. More fossils are needed to better understand if this aspect of their evolution is a recent addition. To get a handle on invasive turtles, understanding more about their ancient relatives could only be helpful. A paper reporting this discovery is published in the journal PeerJ.

This is an exciting discovery, which will greatly increase our knowledge of prehistoric forest ecosystems, said Dr. Miguel Montoro Girona, a researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Ume\u00e5, Sweden. It is comparable to the fossil pollen and charcoal markers in sediments, which revolutionized prehistoric research to provide information on plants, climate and forest fires going back thousands of years. Our new method can be applied to many ecosystems where moths and butterflies have a marked influence on the landscape. Moths are one of the most widespread and recognizable insects in the world. In the boreal forests of North America, which are mainly comprised of coniferous, evergreen trees, the larva of one moth species  the spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana  can periodically cause severe and widespread damage. This leads to millions of dollars of lost revenue to the forest based economy. It was during a routine observation of one of these outbreaks that Dr. Montoro Girona and co authors had a Eureka moment. Together with an insect specialist, we recently identified a strange structure in a colleagues lake water sample, which turned out to be a scale from a moth wing, said Dr. Hubert Morin, a researcher at the Qu\u00e9bec University, Canada. Afterwards, during a spruce budworm outbreak, I noticed the lakes were covered in dead moths. Knowing they are made from a material that is likely to be well preserved in the sediments of lakes, I realized they had the potential to provide information about these swarms going back thousands of years. This hunch turned out to be true. Taking a 5 m long core of sediment from a forest lake near Qu\u00e9bec, which represented 10,000 years worth of sediment deposit, the team spent five years perfecting their method of extracting, examining and counting moth scales under the microscope from each sediment layer. Our analysis revealed peaks of moth scales that corresponded to known periods of insect outbreak, said Dr. Lionel Navarro, also from the Qu\u00e9bec University. This means we can work out when these epidemics occurred before records began. This new method will be of enormous help to future research in areas as wide as ecology and evolution, biodiversity conservation, climate change and forestry. The findings were published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution. "}, {"title": " New Research Sheds Light on Dinosaurs of \u2018Lost Landmass\u2019 of Appalachia", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Feb 21, 2018", "doc": "Around 90 million years ago, eastern and western North America were isolated from each other by a salty sea, creating two landmasses Appalachia and Laramidia. The ancestors of Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus strutted about on the latter in what would one day become Utah and Alberta, leaving plentiful bones behind. A lack of fossils from eastern North America, however, has obscured Appalachia, leading to it being called a lost landmass. Now, new research is broadening our knowledge of the dinosaurs that lived and died near the major metropolises of the eastern United States and Canada. Dinosaurs from eastern North America have always been regarded as rather strange by scientists. One relative of Tyrannosaurus rex from New Jersey has gigantic hands tipped with giant claws, a far cry from the notoriously puny arms of its western cousin. Giant duck billed dinosaurs, more than 35 feet long from beak to tail, left their remains in the sediments of North Carolina. All named eastern North American dinosaurs are known only from incomplete or fragmentary skeletons. Unlike the world class fossil deposits of the American West, eastern North American sediments usually produce only the stray bone shard or tooth. Unfortunately, this lack of fossils from eastern North America has hindered attempts at better understanding the distribution and evolution of dinosaurs during a period known as the Cretaceous, which lasted from about 140 65 million years ago. For the past few years, Chase Brownstein, a research associate of paleontology at the Stamford Museum  Nature Center in Stamford, Connecticut, has been investigating this issue. The paleontologist tallied up reports of dinosaurs from across the eastern part of the continent as presented in publications spanning over 150 years of scientific inquiry. This is, to my knowledge, the most complete review of eastern North American dinosaurs out there, he said. Additionally, Brownstein compared the compiled Appalachian dinosaur faunas to each other and to those from the American West to understand how the former changed from the latter during the 30 million year period of their separation. The results suggest that eastern North American dinosaur faunas were not only distinct from those of the west, but also that the former were by and large composed of species rather more primitive than their relatives from western North America and Asia, a hypothesis that has been gaining ground in recent years. Additionally, the new research may show that the dinosaur wildlife from different parts of Appalachia differed from that of other areas of the landmass. A phenomenon known as faunal provincialism, in which different regions of a larger area have distinct assortments of species, may have occurred on Laramidia, and only recently has it been proposed for Appalachian dinosaurs, Brownstein said. The new data does seem to indicate limited provincialism may have occurred among Appalachian dinosaur faunas, but future research will be needed to better substantiate this hypothesis. This research was published in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

Thats according to a team of U.S. paleontologists who analyzed numerous footprints of adult, juvenile and infant mammoths recently found at the Pleistocene locality of Fossil Lake in central Oregon. Museum of Natural and Cultural History paleontologist Professor Greg Retallack and colleagues found 117 Columbian mammoth tracks, including one adult trail, partial trackways of 3 additional adults, a yearling and a baby all heading generally west. The researchers zeroed in on a 20 footprint track, dating to roughly 43,000 years ago, that exhibited some intriguing features. These prints were especially close together, and those on the right were more deeply impressed than those on the left as if an adult mammoth had been limping, Professor Retallack explained. But the limping animal wasnt alone. Two sets of smaller footprints appeared to be approaching and retreating from the limpers trackway. These juveniles may have been interacting with an injured adult female, returning to her repeatedly throughout the journey, possibly out of concern for her slow progress, he added. Such behavior has been observed with wounded adults in modern, matriarchal herds of African elephants. The tracks were made in a layer of volcanic soil at Fossil Lake, a site first excavated by University of Oregons Professor Thomas Condon in 1876 and today administered by the Bureau of Land Management. They were mapped and documented using photogrammetry, which helps scientists perform accurate measurements based on land based or aerial photographs. Trace fossils such as trackways can provide unique insights into natural history, Professor Retallack said. Tracks sometimes tell more about ancient creatures than their bones, particularly when it comes to their behavior. Its amazing to see this kind of interaction preserved in the fossil record. The findings appear in the journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology.

A paper reporting this discovery is published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. Dubbed Candelarhynchus padillai, the new species is the first fossil lizardfish from the Cretaceous period ever found in Colombia and tropical South America. It is rare to find such a complete fossil of a fish from this moment in the Cretaceous period, said lead author Oksana Vernygora, a Ph.D. student at the University of Alberta. Deepwater fish are difficult to recover, as well as those from environments with fast flowing waters. The discovery contributes to the growing and important body of literature on the fossil record in the tropics. The tropics worldwide are hotspots of diversity, said co author Javier Luque, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Alberta. Interestingly, we know a great deal about modern biodiversity in these areas, but the fossil record is poorly understood in comparison. This adds another piece to that puzzle. And the importance of understanding fossil fish is often underestimated, Vernygora added. Often we think, we have fish now, we had fish then, and well likely have fish in the future. But the importance of fish is just that. We can see how fish have changed as their environments have changed throughout history. Studying fish diversity gives us amazing predicting power for the future  especially as we start to see the effects of climate change. The discovery was made with the unlikely assistance of a young tourist, visiting the Monastery of La Candelaria, near the town of R\u00e1quira Boyac\u00e1, Colombia. A kid was walking into the monastery during a tour when he noticed the shape of a fish in flagstones on the ground, Luque said. He took a photo and, a few days later, showed it to staff at the Centro de Investigaciones Paleontologicas, a local museum with whom we collaborate to protect and study fossil findings from the region. Staff at the center recognized the image as a fossil fish right away and shared the finding with us. "}, {"title": " Remarkable Tailed Arachnid Found in Burmese Amber", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Feb 7, 2018", "doc": "A remarkable tailed arachnid found in the mid Cretaceous approximately 100 million years ago Burmese amber of Myanmar documents a key transition stage in spider evolution. Despite its appearance, the new arachnid is not a direct ancestor of modern day spiders. Named Chimerarachne yingi, the animal resembles a spider in having fangs, male pedipalps, four walking legs and silk producing spinnerets at its rear. However, it also bears a long flagellum or tail. No living spider has a tail, although some relatives of spiders, the vinegaroons, do have an anal flagellum. Four specimens of Chimerarachne yingi were found, and all are tiny, about 2.5 mm body length, excluding the nearly 3 mm long tail. Any sort of flagelliform appendage tends to be like an antenna, said Dr. Paul Selden, a researcher in the Paleontological Institute and the Department of Geology at the University of Kansas. Its for sensing the environment. Animals that have a long whippy tail tend to have it for sensory purposes. The find confirms a prediction made a few years ago by Dr. Selden and colleagues when they described a similar tailed arachnid, which resembled a spider but lacked spinnerets. These animals, from the much older Devonian about 380 million years ago and Permian about 290 million years ago periods, formed the basis of a new arachnid order, the Uraraneida, which lies along the line to modern spiders. The ones we recognized previously were different in that they had a tail but dont have the spinnerets, Dr. Selden said. Thats why the new one is really interesting, apart from the fact that its much younger  it seems to be an intermediate form. In our analysis, it comes out sort of in between the older one that hadnt developed the spinneret and modern spider that has lost the tail. Chimerarachne yingi lies one step closer to modern spiders on account of its possession of spinning organs. Little of the tiny spiders day to day behavior could be determined, Dr. Selden said. We can only speculate that, because it was trapped in amber, we assume it was living on or around tree trunks. Amber is fossilized resin, so for a spider to have become trapped, it may well have lived under bark or in the moss at the foot of a tree. While the tailed spider was capable of producing silk due to its spinnerets, it was unlikely to have constructed webs to trap bugs like many modern spiders. We dont know if it wove webs. Spinnerets are used to produce silk but for a whole host of reasons  to wrap eggs, to make burrows, to make sleeping hammocks or just to leave behind trails. If they live in burrows and leave, they leave a trail so they can find their way back. These all evolved before spiders made it up into the air and made insect traps. Spiders went up into the air when the insects went up into the air. I presume that it didnt make webs that stretched across bushes. However, like all spiders it would have been a carnivore and would have eaten insects, I imagine. The scientists dont know whether Chimerarachne yingi was venomous. We do know that the arachnid ancestor probably had a tail, and living groups like whip scorpions also have a whip like tail. Chimerarachne yingi appears to have retained this primitive feature, said Dr. Jason Dunlop, from the Museum F\u00fcr Naturkunde in Berlin, Germany. Taken together, Chimerarachne yingi has a unique body plan among the arachnids and raises important questions about what an early spider looked like, and how the spinnerets and pedipalp organ may have evolved. The research is published in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution.

Ichthyosaurs were predatory sea going reptiles that ranged in size from 1 to 69 feet 0.3 21 m long. They swam the worlds oceans for millions of years during the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Despite their profound adaptations to the aquatic realm, these reptiles disappeared about 30 million years before the end Cretaceous mass extinction 65 million years ago that marked the end for dinosaurs and the beginning of the age of mammals. In 2016, a paleontologist and honorary scientist at the University of Manchester, Dean Lomax, described an ichthyosaur skeleton that he had examined in the collections of Leicesters New Walk Museum and Art Gallery. He spotted several unusual features of the bones and determined that the features were unique and represented a completely new species, Wahlisaurus massarae. When Wahlisaurus massarae was announced, I was a little nervous about what other paleontologists would make of it, considering the new species was known only from a single specimen, Lomax said. As a scientist you learn to question almost everything, and be as critical as you can be. My analysis suggested it was something new, but some paleontologists questioned this and said it was just variation of an existing species. In the new study, Lomax teamed up with New Walk Museum paleontologist Mark Evans and Simon Carpenter, fossil collector of Somerset. The study focuses on a specimen Lomax identified in Simons private collection, which is an almost complete coracoid bone part of the pectoral girdle that has exactly the same unique features of the same bone in Wahlisaurus massarae. You can only imagine my sheer excitement to find a specimen of Wahlisaurus massarae, Lomax said. It was such a wonderful moment. When you have just one specimen, variation can be called upon, but when you double the number of specimens you have it gives even more credibility to your research. The new discovery is from a time known as the Triassic Jurassic boundary, right after a world wide mass extinction. For these reasons, the authors have been unable to determine exactly whether the ichthyosaur was latest Triassic or earliest Jurassic in age, although it is roughly 200 million year old. The teams results will be published in the Geological Journal. "}, {"title": " New Species of Titanosaur Unearthed in Egypt: Mansourasaurus shahinae", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jan 30, 2018", "doc": "Paleontologists in Egypt have found fossil fragments from a new species of titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur that walked the Earth around 80 million years ago Cretaceous period. Dubbed Mansourasaurus shahinae, the ancient beast was a type of titanosaur, a group of sauropod long necked plant eating dinosaurs. Its fossilized skeleton, including skull elements, was discovered near the Dakhla Oasis in the Egyptian Western Desert. Mansoura University paleontologist Hesham Sallam and colleagues determined the remains belong to a new genus and species of titanosaur. The skeleton of Mansourasaurus shahinae is important in being the most complete dinosaur specimen so far discovered from the end of the Cretaceous in Africa, preserving parts of the skull, the lower jaw, neck and back vertebrae, ribs, most of the shoulder and forelimb, part of the hind foot, and pieces of dermal plates, the researchers said. When I first saw pics of the fossils, my jaw hit the floor, said co author Dr. Matt Lamanna, from Carnegie Museum of Natural History. This was the Holy Grail  a well preserved dinosaur from the end of the Age of Dinosaurs in Africa  that we paleontologists had been searching for a long, long time. During the earlier years of the dinosaurs, throughout much of the Triassic and Jurassic periods, all the continents were joined together as the supercontinent Pangaea. During the Cretaceous period, however, the continents began splitting apart and shifting towards the configuration we see today. Historically, it hasnt been clear how well connected Africa was to other Southern Hemisphere landmasses and Europe during this time  to what degree African animals may have been cut off from their neighbors and evolving on their own separate tracks. Mansourasaurus shahinae, as one of the few African dinosaurs known from this time period, helps to answer that question. Mansourasaurus shahinae is a key new dinosaur species, and a critical discovery for Egyptian and African paleontology, said co author Dr. Eric Gorscak, from the Field Museum. This dinosaur helps us address longstanding questions about Africas fossil record and paleobiology  what animals were living there, and to what other species were these animals most closely related? By analyzing features of its bones, the paleontologists determined that Mansourasaurus shahinae is more closely related to dinosaurs from Europe and Asia than to those found farther south in Africa or in South America. This, in turn, shows that at least some dinosaurs could move between Africa and Europe near the end of these animals reign. Africas last dinosaurs werent completely isolated, contrary to what some have proposed in the past. There were still connections to Europe, Dr. Gorscak said. The findings appear in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution. "}, {"title": " Cambrian Period Worm Had Hair-Sized Bristles on Its Head and Body", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jan 29, 2018", "doc": "A new species of bristle worm that lived about 508 million years ago Cambrian period has been identified from fossils found in Marble Canyon and Burgess Shale sites, both in British Columbia, Canada. Dubbed Kootenayscolex barbarensis, the ancient worm was a type of annelid, a highly diverse group of animals that includes modern day leeches and earthworms. While the diversity of annelids in terms of their anatomies and lifestyles makes them ecologically important and an evolutionarily interesting group to study, it also makes it difficult to piece together what the ancestral annelid may have looked like, said Karma Nanglu, a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto and a researcher at the Royal Ontario Museum. Although annelids are found all over the world  from the bottoms of oceans and lakes to mountain glaciers  their early evolutionary history is confounded by a poor fossil record, with few species described from well preserved body fossils near the evolutionary origins of the group. While isolated pieces of annelid jaws and some mineralized tubes secreted by the animals are well known, preservation of their soft tissues is exceedingly rare, said Dr. Jean Bernard Caron, also from the University of Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum. You need to look to truly exceptional fossil deposits like those found in the Burgess Shale to find well preserved body fossils. Even then, theyre quite uncommon and many of the currently described species there are still poorly understood. Kootenayscolex barbarensis was up to 1.2 inches 3 cm long and had hair sized bristles on the head. The\u00a0worm possessed paired bundles of hair sized bristles spread along the body, Nanglu said. This is one of the diagnostic features of this group of animals. However, unlike any living forms, these bristles were also partially covering the head, more specifically surrounding the mouth. The new species seems to suggest that the annelid head evolved from posterior body segments which had pair bundles of bristles, a hypothesis supported by the developmental biology of many modern annelid species. The fine anatomical details preserved in Kootenayscolex barbarensis allow us to infer not only its evolutionary position, but also its lifestyle, Nanglu added. Sediment preserved inside their guts suggests that, much as their relatives do in modern ecosystems, these worms served an important role in the food chain by recycling organic material from the sediment back to other animals that preyed on them. The findings are published in the January 22 edition of the journal Current Biology. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Propose New Theory on Horse Evolution", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jan 26, 2018", "doc": "Researchers have long wondered how horses evolved from a five toed ancestor to the single toed animal we know today. While it is largely believed that they simply evolved with fewer digits, Professor Nikos Solounias from the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine pose a new theory that suggests remnants of all five toes are still present within the hooves of the horse. Humans and horses are descendants of a common ancestor with five digits. As horses evolved to live on open grassland their anatomy required a more compact design to enable movement across the hard plains. Until now, scientists believed horses adapted to these conditions by gradually evolving with fewer digits than its five toed ancestor, with the first horse retaining only four digits, its later descendant reduced to three, and todays horse retaining just the central digit known as the metacarpal, the long bone above the hoof. For the first time, Professor Solounias and colleagues propose that the reduction in the number of digits is not a matter of simple attrition instead, they believe that all five digits have merged to form the compacted forelimbs with hooves that we know today. Currently, researchers accept that splints, small bones found along the outer sides of the metacarpal in modern horses, are partially formed remnants of second and fourth digits. Tapering mid way down the metacarpal, these fragments were inherited from an earlier ancestor, but ceased to develop into fully formed digits in modern horses. While this explanation of the second and fourth digits is viable, it is incomplete and fails to account for the animals first and fifth digits, the paleontologists said. The horse is not truly monodactyl, that is, one toed. Fragments of the missing digits can be found in the form of ridges on the backside of the splints. According to the team, this demonstrates that the first and fifth digits were not simply lost to evolution, but attached to their neighboring second and fourth digits. With a distinct surface from the metacarpal, we know the splints on todays horses to be the remnants of the second and fourth digits, Professor Solounias said. However, these partially formed digits also appear to contain their own elevated surfaces which hold additional evolutionary clues. We find these ridges, located on the posterior of each splint, to be the partially formed remains of the first and fifth digits, which were once connected to the cartilages of the hoof. Professor Solounias first considered this theory in 1999 while studying fossil evidence from an 8 million year old horse known as Hipparion primigenium. The famous Laetoli footprints in Tanzania demonstrate Hipparion walked alongside early humans, and was believed to have had three digits. However, the scientist noticed that the bottom surface of Hipparions fossilized forelimb appeared to be divided in five sections, as though small toes had bonded together. After further studying images of the Laetoli footprints, he confirmed his finding in several of the impressions, and considered that Hipparion not only had five compacted toes, but likely passed this trait on to its descendants. Interestingly, we not only find hints of the missing digits on the modern horse, but also its ancestors, such as Hipparion and Mesohippus, two species believed to have three toes, Professor Solounias said. While the horses lineage is classically described as having evolved from four to three toes, and eventually one single toe, we show that its extinct ancestors exhibit the reduced toes both at the wrist and at the hoof, said co author Melinda Danowitz, also from the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine. These findings show that todays horse is not truly monodactyl, and earlier ancestors were not in fact tridactyl or tetradactyl, that is, three toed or four toed. The team also discovered neurovascular evidence in support of the five digit theory, with dissections of modern equine fetus forelimbs revealing a greater number of arteries and nerves than would be expected in a single digit. If todays horse does indeed have one digit per forelimb, we would expect each forelimb to have a total of two veins, two arteries, and two nerve bundles, Danowitz said. However, our dissections found between five and seven neurovascular bundles per forelimb, suggesting that additional toes begin to develop, but do not become fully differentiated. The research appears in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

Caihong juji is part of a group of small, bird like dinosaurs that lived in what is now China during the Jurassic period. This dinosaur was tiny, about the size of a duck, with a bony crest on its head and long, ribbon like feathers. And, based on analysis of its fossilized feathers, the feathers on its head, wings, and tail were iridescent, with colors that shimmered and shifted in the light. Iridescent coloration is well known to be linked to sexual selection and signaling, and we report its earliest evidence in dinosaurs. Caihong juji may have a cute nickname in English, Rainbow, but it has serious scientific implications, said co lead author Professor Julia Clarke, from the University of Texas at Austin. When you look at the fossil record, you normally only see hard parts like bone, but every once in a while, soft parts like feathers are preserved, and you get a glimpse into the past, said co author Dr. Chad Eliason, a postdoctoral researcher at the Field Museum. The slab of rock from Chinas Hebei Province where Caihong juji was discovered by a farmer in 2014 contained a nearly complete skeleton surrounded by impressions made by feathers. The impressions preserved the shape of the melanosomes. The paleontologists compared the melanosome impressions to melanosomes found in living birds and found that they most closely resembled those in the iridescent, rainbow feathers of hummingbirds. Aside from making Jurassic ecosystems of 161 million years ago more colorful, Caihong juji is interesting because it has features that are both ancient and modern, said co lead author Professor Xing Xu, from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The bony crest is a feature usually seen in dinosaurs from earlier eras, while its neck feathers show evidence of melanosomes that may represent the first known occurrence of iridescence similar to that found in a variety of hummingbird species living today. There are crests associated with sexual selection previously known only in earlier dinosaurs, and yet there is also a bird mechanism of signaling or display appearing for the first time, Professor Clarke added. Caihong juji is also the earliest known animal with asymmetrical feathers  a feature used by modern birds to steer when flying. This dinosaur couldnt fly, though  its feathers were probably primarily used to attract mates and keep warm. While modern birds asymmetrical feathers are on their wingtips, Caihong jujis were on its tail. The tail feathers are asymmetrical but wing feathers not, a bizarre feature previously unknown among dinosaurs including birds, Professor Xu said. This suggests that controlling flight might have been first evolved with tail feathers during some kind of aerial locomotion. Caihong juji stands out even among its closest relatives, Professor Xu added. While the other dinosaurs have bird like, triangular skulls and long forearm bones in comparison to birds today, this dinosaur had a long and narrow skull, and unlike many of these other dinosaurs, its short forelimbs show proportions more akin to modern birds. This combination of traits is unusual, Professor Clarke. It has a rather Velociraptor looking low and long skull with this fully feathered, shaggy kind of plumage and a big fan tail. It is really cool or maybe creepy looking depending on your perspective. "}, {"title": " New Dinosaur Species Discovered in Australia", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jan 16, 2018", "doc": "A new species of turkey sized herbivorous dinosaur being named Diluvicursor pickeringi has been unearthed in southeastern Australia. Diluvicursor pickeringi means Pickerings flood running dinosaur lived approximately 113 million years ago Cretaceous period in what is known as the Australian Antarctic rift valley. The species name honors the late David Pickering, who was Museums Victorias Collection Manager, Vertebrate Palaeontology, said University of Queensland paleontologist Dr. Matt Herne and colleagues. David contributed significantly to Australian paleontology in the lab and field, and tirelessly assisted countless students of paleontology and researchers to achieve their goals. The partial skeleton of Diluvicursor pickeringi was discovered at the Eric the Red West locality of the Eumeralla Formation in southern Victoria by volunteer prospector George Caspar in 2005. The fossilized tail and foot bones of\u00a0Diluvicursor pickeringi give new insight into the diversity of the small, bipedal herbivorous dinosaurs called ornithopods that roamed the great rift valley that once existed between Australia and Antarctica, the researchers said. This dinosaur shows for the first time that there were at least two distinct body types among closely related ornithopods in this part of Australia. One was lightly built with an extraordinarily long tail, while the other, Diluvicursor pickeringi, was more solidly built, with a far shorter tail. Our preliminary reconstruction of the tail musculature of Diluvicursor pickeringi suggests this dinosaur was a good runner, with powerful leg retracting muscles. Understanding the ecology of these dinosaurs  what they ate, how they moved, where they roamed  based on the interplay between anatomy and the environment presents exciting challenges for future research, Dr. Herne said. The Eric the Red West locality has additional importance as it helps build a picture of the ancient rift valley ecosystem. Fossil vertebrate remains at the Eric the Red West site were buried in deep scours at the base of a powerful river, along with flood transported tree stumps, logs and branches, Dr. Herne said. The carcass of the Diluvicursor pickeringi holotype appears to have become entangled in a log jam at the bottom of this river. The sizes of some of the logs in the deposit and the abundance of wood suggest the river traversed a well forested floodplain. The logs preserved at the site are likely to represent conifer forests of trees within families still seen in Australia today. Much of the fossil vertebrate material from Eric the Red West has yet to be described, so further dinosaurs and other exciting animals from this site are now anticipated. The discovery of Diluvicursor pickeringi is reported in the journal PeerJ.

The fossils, mostly wing scales, are more than 70 million years older than the oldest fossils of flowering plants, and they shed new light on the so far presumed co evolution between flowering plants and pollinating insects. The team, led by Utrecht University researchers Timo van Eldijk and Bas van de Schootbrugge, analyzed about 70 fossilized wing scales and scale fragments from a drilled core in northern Germany, which dates to the Triassic Jurassic boundary 200 million years ago. The fossil remains contain distinctive hollow scales, and provide clear evidence for a group of moths with sucking mouthparts, which is related to the vast majority of living moths and butterflies, Dr. van de Schootbrugge said. Modern day butterflies are well known for their association with flowering plants angiosperms and the butterfly tongue has long been assumed to be an important adaptation for feeding on flowering plants. The new evidence indicates that the first lepidopterans were associated with non flowering seed plants gymnosperms, the ecologically dominant plant group during the Jurassic. The earliest proboscid moths Glossata likely used their sucking mouthparts to feed on the sugary pollination droplets secreted by several groups of gymnosperms. This shift in host food preference from gymnosperms to angiosperms challenges the notion that the development of the sucking proboscis was an adaptive response to the evolution of angiosperm flowers. The findings also suggest that the end Triassic mass extinction event 201 million years ago has not affected moths and butterflies, the researchers said. On the contrary, like dinosaurs, it is likely that the event triggered their expansion. The mass extinction event occurred at the end of the Triassic and was associated with massive volcanism as the super continent Pangea started to break apart, van Eldijk said. As a result, biodiversity on land and in the oceans suffered a setback with many key Triassic species going extinct, including many primitive reptiles. However, one major group of insects, the Lepidoptera moths and butterflies, appeared unaffected. Instead, this group diversified during a period of ecological turnover. The results are published in the journal Science Advances.

Burrowing bats family Mystacinidae are only found now in New Zealand, but they once also lived in Australia. They are peculiar because they not only fly they also scurry about on all fours, over the forest floor, under leaf litter and along tree branches, while foraging for both animal and plant food. Burrowing bats are more closely related to bats living in South America than to others in the southwest Pacific, said Professor Sue Hand, from the University of New South Wales in Australia. They are related to vampire bats, ghost faced bats, fishing and frog eating bats, and nectar feeding bats, and belong to a bat superfamily that once spanned the southern landmasses of Australia, New Zealand, South America and possibly Antarctica. The newly found fossil bat, named Vulcanops jennyworthyae, was relatively large, with an estimated body mass of 40\u2009g. It fossilized remains teeth and bones were recovered from freshwater lake sediments 16 19 million years old near St Bathans, Central Otago, South Island. New Zealands burrowing bats are renowned for their extremely broad diet. They eat insects and other invertebrates such as weta and spiders, which they catch on the wing or chase by foot. And they also regularly consume fruit, flowers and nectar, Professor Hand said. However, Vulcanops jennyworthyaes specialized teeth and large size suggest it had a different diet, capable of eating even more plant food as well as small vertebrates  a diet more like some of its South American cousins. We dont see this in Australasian bats today. The fossils of this spectacular bat and several others in the St Bathans Fauna show that the prehistoric aviary that was New Zealand also included a surprising diversity of furry critters alongside the birds, said Dr. Trevor Worthy of Flinders University. These bats, along with land turtles and crocodiles, show that major groups of animals have been lost from New Zealand, added Professor Paul Scofield of Canterbury Museum. They show that the iconic survivors of this lost fauna  the tuataras, moas, kiwi, acanthisittid wrens, and leiopelmatid frogs  evolved in a far more complex community that hitherto thought. This diverse fauna lived in or around a 5,600 km2 prehistoric Lake Manuherikia that once covered much of the Maniototo region of the South Island. When they lived, temperatures in New Zealand were warmer than today and semitropical to warm temperate forests and ferns edged the vast paleolake. Vulcanops jennyworthyae provides new insight into the original diversity of bats in Australasia, the paleontologists said. Its lineage became extinct sometime after the Early Miocene, as did a number of other lineages present in the St Bathans assemblage. These include crocodiles, terrestrial turtles, flamingo like palaelodids, swiftlets, several pigeon, parrot and shorebird lineages and non flying mammals. Most of these were probably warm adapted species. After the middle Miocene, global climate change brought colder and drier conditions to New Zealand, with significant changes to vegetation and environments. It is likely that this general cooling and drying trend drove overall loss in bat diversity in New Zealand, where just two bat species today comprise the entire native land mammal fauna. The teams findings are published in the journal Scientific Reports.

Habelia optata, a well armored sea predator of about 2 cm in length with a tail as long as the rest of the body, lived approximately 508 million years ago during the middle Cambrian period. It comes from the renowned Burgess Shale fossil deposit in British Columbia and belongs to the group of invertebrate animals called arthropods, which also includes such familiar creatures as spiders, insects, lobsters and crabs. Like all arthropods, Habelia optata features a segmented body with external skeleton and jointed limbs. What remained unclear for many years, however, was the main sub group of arthropods to which this ancient creature belonged. Early studies had mentioned mandibulates  a hyperdiverse lineage whose members possess antennae and a pair of specialized appendages known as mandibles, usually used to grasp, squeeze and crush their food. But Habelia optata was later left as one of the typically unresolved arthropods of the Burgess Shale. In the new study, University of Toronto paleontologists reinvestigated Habelia optata and found that it was instead a close relative of the ancestor of all chelicerates, the other sub group of arthropods living today, named for the presence of appendages called chelicerae in front of the mouth and used to cut food. This is mostly due to the overall anatomy of the head in Habelia optata, and the presence of two small chelicerae like appendages revealed in these fossils. Habelia optata now shows in great detail the body architecture from which chelicerates emerged, which allows us to solve some long standing questions, said Dr. C\u00e9dric Aria, lead author of the study. We can now explain why, for instance, horseshoe crabs have a reduced pair of limbs  the chilaria  at the back of their heads. Those are relics of fully formed appendages, as chelicerates seem to originally have had heads with no less than seven pairs of limbs.  Dr. Aria and his colleague, Dr. Jean Bernard Caron, analyzed 41 specimens in total, the majority of which are new specimens acquired by fieldwork parties to the Burgess Shale. The research illustrates that the well armored body of Habelia optata, covered in a multitude of different spines, was divided into head, thorax and post thorax, all bearing different types of appendages. The thorax displays five pairs of walking legs, while the post thorax houses rounded appendages likely used in respiration. Scorpions and the now extinct sea scorpions are also chelicerates with bodies divided into three distinct regions, Dr. Aria said. We think that these regions broadly correspond to those of Habelia optata. But a major difference is that scorpions and sea scorpions, like all chelicerates, literally walk on their heads, while Habelia optata still had walking appendages in its thorax. This difference in anatomy allowed Habelia optata to evolve an especially complex head that makes this fossil species even more peculiar compared to known chelicerates. The head of Habelia optata contained a series of five appendages made of a large plate with teeth for mastication, a leg like branch with stiff bristle like spines for grasping, and an elongate, slender branch modified as a sensory or tactile appendage. This complex apparatus of appendages and jaws made Habelia optata an exceptionally fierce predator for its size. It was likely both very mobile and efficient in tearing apart its preys, Dr. Aria said. The research is published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology. "}, {"title": " Study: Simple Life Forms are Common throughout Universe", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Dec 19, 2017", "doc": "A detailed analysis of 3.465 billion year old microbial microfossils provides evidence to support an increasingly widespread understanding that life in the Universe is common. Professor J. William Schopf from the University of California, Los Angeles, and his colleagues analyzed 11 specimens of 5 species of prokaryotic cellular microfossils from the Apex Basalt Formation, Pilbara Craton, Western Australia. Two of the five species the researchers studied were primitive photosynthesizers, one was an Archaeal methane producer, and two others were methane consumers. The evidence that a diverse group of organisms had already evolved extremely early in the Earths history strengthens the case for life existing elsewhere in the Universe because it would be extremely unlikely that life formed quickly on Earth but did not arise anywhere else, they said. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the most detailed ever conducted on microorganisms preserved in such ancient fossils. By 3.465 billion years ago, life was already diverse on Earth thats clear  primitive photosynthesizers, methane producers, methane users, Professor Schopf said. These are the first data that show the very diverse organisms at that time in Earths history, and our previous research has shown that there were sulfur users 3.4 billion years ago as well. This tells us life had to have begun substantially earlier and it confirms that it was not difficult for primitive life to form and to evolve into more advanced microorganisms. Scientists still do not know how much earlier life might have begun. But, if the conditions are right, it looks like life in the Universe should be widespread. Professor Schopf and co authors analyzed the Apex specimens with cutting edge technology called secondary ion mass spectroscopy SIMS, which reveals the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 isotopes  information scientists can use to determine how the microorganisms lived. They used a secondary ion mass spectrometer  one of just a few in the world  to separate the carbon from each fossil into its constituent isotopes and determine their ratios. The differences in carbon isotope ratios correlate with their shapes. Their carbon 12 to carbon 13 ratios are characteristic of biology and metabolic function, said co author Professor John Valley, from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The fossils were formed at a time when there was very little oxygen in the atmosphere, Professor Schopf added. I think that advanced photosynthesis had not yet evolved, and that oxygen first appeared on Earth approximately half a billion years later before its concentration in our atmosphere increased rapidly starting about 2 billion years ago. Oxygen would have been poisonous to these microorganisms, and would have killed them, the scientist said. Primitive photosynthesizers are fairly rare on Earth today because they exist only in places where there is light but no oxygen  normally there is abundant oxygen anywhere there is light. And the existence of the rocks the team analyzed is also rather remarkable. The average lifetime of a rock exposed on the surface of the Earth is about 200 million years, Professor Schopf noted. When I began my career, there was no fossil evidence of life dating back farther than 500 million years ago. The rocks we studied are about as far back as rocks go. While the study strongly suggests the presence of primitive life forms throughout the Universe, the presence of more advanced life is very possible but less certain, he said. "}, {"title": " Protarctos abstrusus: Ancient Primitive Bear Had a Sweet Tooth", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Dec 18, 2017", "doc": "An international team of paleontologists has found the remains of an unusual prehistoric bear that lived 3.5 million years ago Pliocene epoch in Canadas High Arctic. The High Arctic bear is a close relative of the ancestor of modern bears. It represents an ursine bear all living bears plus their ancestors, except the giant panda species called Protarctos abstrusus. The animal was the size of an Asian black bear and slightly smaller than an American black bear, with a flatter head and a combination of primitive and advanced dental characters. This is evidence of the most northerly record for primitive bears, and provides an idea of what the ancestor of modern bears may have looked like, said team member Dr. Xiaoming Wang, from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Protarctos abstrusus was previously known only from a tooth found in Idaho, but Dr. Wang and colleagues found the skull, jaws, teeth and parts of the skeleton from two individuals. The skeletal remains of Protarctos abstrusus were collected in different years 1992 2006 from the Beaver Pond site on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canadian Arctic, the paleontologists explained. The fossil bear lived in a northern boreal type forest habitat, where there would have been 24 hour darkness in winter, as well as about six months of ice and snow. Modern bears are wide ranging, found from equatorial to polar regions. Their ancestors, mainly found in Eurasia, date to about 5 million years ago, the researchers said. The new fossil represents one of the early immigrations from Asia to North America but it is probably not a direct ancestor to the modern American black bear. Of further significance is that the teeth of both Protarctos abstrusus individuals show signs of dental cavities. Dental evidence from Protarctos abstrusus appears to be from two individuals, including an apparent young adult, and both show dental caries, suggesting their diets included high amounts of fermentable carbohydrates early in their lives, the authors explained. Simple sugars, such as glucose and fructose, are readily metabolized by many bacteria found in the oral biofilm into various acids. These acids demineralize enamel and dentin and may lead to dental caries. This is the first and earliest documented occurrence of high calorie diet in basal bears, likely related to fat storage in preparation for the harsh Arctic winters, Dr. Wang said. We know that modern bears consume sugary fruits in the fall to promote fat accumulation that allows for winter survival via hibernation, added team member Dr. Natalia Rybczynski, a paleontologist fro mthe Canadian Museum of Nature. The dental cavities in Protarctos abstrusus suggest that consumption of sugar rich foods like berries, in preparation for winter hibernation, developed early in the evolution of bears as a survival strategy. The teams findings appear in the journal Scientific Reports.

Despite their common name, horseshoe crabs are not really crabs crustaceans, and are more closely related to spiders and scorpions. They live primarily in and around shallow ocean waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms, and occasionally come onto shore to mate. There are only four species of horseshoe crabs alive today, and their populations are decreasing. Modern horseshoe crabs are often considered living fossils due to having shown little apparent change in physical appearance over a vast period of geologic time. The fossil record of these animals dates back at least 470 million years ago, but their fossils are generally rare. When horseshoe crab fossils are found they are often new to science, Dr. Lerner and co authors said. Dubbed Vaderlimulus tricki, the newfound fossil represent a new genus and species of horseshoe crabs. The genus is named Vaderlimulus because the animals head shield resembles the helmet worn by Darth Vader from the Star Wars film series, the researchers explained. Vaderlimulus tricki lived approximately 245 million years ago during the Early Triassic epoch. Dinosaurs and mammals were just beginning their evolutionary development during the Triassic, but horseshoe crabs were already ancient by that time, the paleontologists noted. The ancient creature belonged to the extinct family Austrolimulidae and had unusual body proportions. Members of this family were expanding their ecological range from marine into freshwater settings during the Triassic and often exhibit body modifications that provide them with a bizarre appearance by modern standards, Dr. Lerner and colleagues said. "}, {"title": " Giant Prehistoric Penguin Fossil Found in New Zealand", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Dec 13, 2017", "doc": "Paleontologists have found the fossil remains of a giant prehistoric penguin that lived about 59 to 56 million years ago Paleocene epoch in what is now New Zealand. The giant penguins remains were found in the Otago region on New Zealands South Island. Age datings reveal that the bird lived during the Late Paleocene, about 59 to 56 million years ago. The fossils are therefore among the oldest known penguin remains, and it is remarkable that even these early forms reached an enormous size, said Dr. Gerald Mayr, from the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt, Germany. From those bones, Dr. Mayr and colleagues estimated the species would have stood 1.7 m 5.6 feet tall and weighed as much as 100 kg. We examined the wing and leg bones of this penguin and quickly realized that we were looking at a previously unknown species, Dr. Mayr said. Named Kumimanu biceae, the new discovery counts among the largest fossil penguin species, only surpassed in body size by a fossil species from Antarctica, which, however, is only known from very fragmented remains. The paleontologists also demonstrated that phylogenetically, Kumimanu biceae represents a rather archaic species, which is clearly differentiated from the giant penguins known to date from the geologically younger epochs of the Eocene and Oligocene. Kumimanu biceae shows that gigantism was not rare among early penguins, even at the earliest stage of their evolution, Dr. Mayr noted. According to the team, this gigantism developed as a result of the seabirds flightlessness. This raises the question why no penguin giants are alive today. Giant penguins developed shortly after the mass extinction near the end of the Cretaceous period, approximately 66 million years ago, the researchers said. It is possible that the disappearance of large marine reptiles enabled the penguins to explore new ecological niches. However, with the subsequent appearance of other large marine predators such as seals and toothed whales, the penguins faced new competition and predation  which may have led to their extinction. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.

The discovery, reported in the journal Nature Communications, is remarkable because fossils of blood feeding parasites directly associated with remains of their host are exceedingly scarce, and the new specimen is the oldest known to date. Ticks are infamous blood sucking, parasitic organisms, having a tremendous impact on the health of humans, livestock, pets, and even wildlife, but until now clear evidence of their role in deep time has been lacking, said lead author Dr. Enrique Pe\u00f1alver, of the Spanish Geological Survey IGME. The dinosaur feather with the grasping tick offers the first direct evidence of an early parasite host relationship between ticks and feathered dinosaurs. The fossil record tells us that feathers like the one we have studied were already present on a wide range of theropod dinosaurs, a group which included ground running forms without flying ability, as well as bird like dinosaurs capable of powered flight, said co author Dr. Ricardo P\u00e9rez de la Fuente, from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. So although we cant be sure what kind of dinosaur the tick was feeding on, the mid Cretaceous age of the Burmese amber confirms that the feather certainly did not belong to a modern bird, as these appeared much later in theropod evolution according to current fossil and molecular evidence. The paleontologists found indirect evidence of ticks parasitizing dinosaurs in Deinocroton draculi Draculas terrible tick, belonging to a newly described extinct group of ticks. This species was found sealed inside Burmese amber, with one specimen remarkably engorged with blood, increasing its volume approximately 8 times over non engorged forms. Despite this, it has not been possible to directly determine its host animal. But indirect evidence of the likely host for these novel ticks was found in the form of hair like structures setae from the larvae of skin beetles dermestids, found attached to two Deinocroton draculi ticks preserved together. Today, skin beetles feed in nests, consuming feathers, skin and hair from the nests occupants. And as no mammal hairs have yet been found in Cretaceous amber, the presence of skin beetle setae on the two specimens of Deinocroton draculi suggests that the ticks host was a feathered dinosaur. The simultaneous entrapment of two external parasites is extraordinary, and can be best explained if they had a nest inhabiting ecology as some modern ticks do, living in the hosts nest or in their own nest nearby, said co author Dr. David Grimaldi, from the American Museum of Natural History.

The new dinosaur, named Halszkaraptor escuilliei, is a strange new anomaly in the dinosaur world. It walked on two legs on land, with postural adaptations similar to short tailed birds like ducks, but used its flipper like forelimbs to maneuver in water like penguins and other aquatic birds, relying on its long neck for foraging and ambush hunting. The first time I examined the specimen, I even questioned whether it was a genuine fossil, said Dr. Andrea Cau, a researcher at the Geological and Palaeontological Museum Giovanni Capellini in Bologna, Italy. The unexpected mix of traits makes it difficult to place Halszkaraptor escuilliei within traditional classifications. In order to ascertain the integrity of the specimen, it was visualized and reconstructed in 3D using synchrotron multi resolution X ray microtomography. This technique is currently the most powerful and sensitive method to image internal details without damaging invaluable fossils, said Dr. Paul Tafforeau, from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ESRF in Grenoble, France. Our first goal was to demonstrate that this bizarre and unexpected fossil is indeed a genuine animal multi resolution scanning confirmed that the skeleton is not a composite assembled from parts of different dinosaurs, added Dr. Dennis Voeten, also from the ESRF. We implemented new methods for the acquisition and optimization of tomographic scan data, which not only confirmed the integrity of the specimen, but also revealed additional paleontological information, said ESRF researcher Dr. Vincent Fernandez. The synchrotron was even able to reveal, in astonishing detail, those parts of the skeleton that have remained deep within the rock ever since the dinosaur got buried. Our analysis demonstrated that numerous teeth, which are not visible externally, are still preserved inside the mouth, said ESRF scientist Dr. Vincent Beyrand. We also identified a neurovascular mesh inside its snout that resembles those of modern crocodiles to a remarkable degree. These aspects suggest that Halszkaraptor escuilliei was an aquatic predator. Although the new dinosaur is unique in many ways, certain parts of the skeleton, including the sickle shaped killer claws on its feet, are shared with well known dinosaurs such as Velociraptor.

The newly discovered marsupial lion, named Wakaleo schouteni, was the size of a dog and weighed around 23 kg. The species was about a 15th of the weight of the largest and last surviving marsupial lion, Thylacoleo carnifex, that weighed in at 130 kg and which has been extinct for 30,000 years. The identification of this species has brought to light a level of marsupial lion diversity that was quite unexpected and suggest even deeper origins for the family Thylacoleonidae, said Dr. Anna Gillespie, a paleontologist at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The fossilized remains of Wakaleo schouteni  a near complete skull, teeth, and humerus upper arm bone  were found in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area of remote north western Queensland. With the new find, we believe that two different species of marsupial lions were present in the late Oligocene at least 25 million years ago, the paleontologists said. The other, originally named Priscileo pitikantensis, but renamed Wakaleo pitikantensis, was slightly smaller and was identified from teeth and limb bones discovered near Lake Pitikanta in South Australia in 1961. The new species exhibits many skull and dental features of the genus Wakaleo, but it also shared a number of similarities with Priscileo pitikantensis  particularly the presence of three upper premolars and four molars, previously the diagnostic feature of Priscileo. Further similarities of the teeth and humerus which are shared with Wakaleo schouteni indicate that Priscileo pitikantensis is a species of Wakaleo. These dental similarities distinguish Wakaleo schouteni and Priscileo pitikantensis from later species of this genus, all of which show premolar and molar reduction, and suggest that they are the most primitive members of the genus. This latest finding raises new questions about the evolutionary relationships of marsupial lions, Dr. Gillespie concluded. The teams findings are published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology.

The horse family, thanks to its rich and deep fossil record, has been a model system for understanding and teaching evolution. Now ancient DNA has rewritten the evolutionary history of this iconic group, said Dr. Peter Heintzman, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and lead author of the study, published in the journal eLife. Prior to this study, New World stilt legged horses were thought to be related to the Asiatic wild ass or onager, or simply a separate species within the genus Equus, which includes living horses, asses, and zebras. The new results, however, reveal that these horses were not closely related to any living population of horses. Now named Haringtonhippus francisci, this extinct species appears to have diverged from the main trunk of the family tree leading to Equus some 4 to 6 million years ago. The evolutionary distance between the extinct stilt legged horses and all living horses took us by surprise, but it presented us with an exciting opportunity to name a new genus of horse, said study senior author Professor Beth Shapiro, also from the University of California, Santa Cruz. According to the study, Haringtonhippus francisci was a widespread and successful species throughout much of North America, living alongside populations of Equus but not interbreeding with them. In Canadas North, the species survived until roughly 17,000 years ago, more than 19,000 years later than previously known from this region. At the end of the last Ice Age, both horse groups became extinct in North America, along with other large animals like woolly mammoths and saber toothed cats. Morphologically, the fossils of Haringtonhippus francisci are not all that different from those of Equus. But DNA tells a fascinatingly different story altogether, said co author Dr. Eric Scott, from California State University San Bernardino.

To date, only a small handful of pterosaur eggs with a well preserved 3D structure and embryo inside have been found and analyzed three eggs from Argentina and five from China. This sparse sample size was dramatically increased upon the discovery of 215 fossilized eggs of Hamipterus tianshanensis, a species of pteranodontoid pterosaur that lived about 120 million years ago Cretaceous period in what is now northwestern China. Dr. Xiaolin Wang from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and colleagues from China and Brazil used CT scanning to peer inside the eggs, 16 of which contain embryonic remains of varying intactness. The most complete embryo contained a partial wing and cranial bones, including a complete lower jaw. The samples of thigh bones that remain intact are well developed, suggesting that the species benefited from functional hind legs shortly after hatching, the paleontologists said. However, the structure supporting the pectoral muscle appears to be underdeveloped during the embryonic stage, suggesting that newborns were likely not able to fly. Therefore, we propose that newborns likely needed some parental care. Based on growth marks, we estimate one of the individuals to be at least 2 years old and still growing at the time of its death, supporting the growing body of evidence that pterosaurs had long incubation periods. Lastly, the fact that a single collection of embryos exhibits a range of developmental stages hints that pterosaurs participated in colonial nesting behavior. The discovery is reported in the journal Science.

Anchiornis lived in what is now northeastern China during the Jurassic period, about 160 million years ago. This dinosaur had wing bearing arms, long legs, and a long tail. It had a wing span of up to 1.64 feet 0.5 m, grew to about 1.3 feet 0.4 m long, and weighed 0.1 0.25 kg. In the new study, University of Bristol paleontologists Dr. Evan Saitta and Dr. Jakob Vinther examined an exceptionally preserved fossil of Anchiornis. The researchers then compared the species fossilized feathers to those of other dinosaurs and extinct birds. Anchiornis contour feathers revealed a newly described, extinct, primitive feather form consisting of a short quill with long, independent, flexible barbs erupting from the quill at low angles to form two vanes and a forked feather shape. Such feathers would have given Anchiornis a fluffy appearance relative to the streamlined bodies of modern flying birds, whose feathers have tightly zipped vanes forming continuous surfaces. Anchiornis unzipped feathers might have affected the dinosaurs ability to control its temperature and repel water, possibly being less effective than the vanes of most modern feathers. This shaggy plumage would also have increased drag when Anchiornis glided. Additionally, the feathers on the wing of Anchiornis lack the aerodynamic, asymmetrical vanes of modern flight feathers, and the study shows that these vanes were also not tightly zipped compared to modern flight feathers. This would have hindered the feathers ability to form a lift surface. To compensate, paravian dinosaurs like Anchiornis packed multiple rows of long feathers into the wing, unlike modern birds, where most of the wing surface is formed by just one row of feathers. Furthermore, Anchiornis and other paravians had four wings, with long feathers on the legs in addition to the arms, as well as elongated feathers forming a fringe around the tail. This increase in surface area likely allowed for gliding before the evolution of powered flight. To assist in reconstructing the updated look of Anchiornis, scientific illustrator Rebecca Gelernter worked with the team to draw the animal as it was in life. The new piece represents a radical shift in dinosaur depictions and incorporates previous research. The novel aspects of the wing and contour feathers, as well as fully feathered hands and feet, are added to the depiction, Dr. Saitta said. Most provocatively, Anchiornis is presented in this artwork climbing in the manner of hoatzin chicks, the only living bird whose juveniles retain a relic of their dinosaurian past, a functional claw. This contrasts much previous art that places paravians perched on top of branches like modern birds. However, such perching is unlikely given the lack of a reversed toe as in modern perching birds and climbing is consistent with the well developed arms and claws in paravians. Overall, our study provides some new insight into the appearance of dinosaurs, their behavior and physiology, and the evolution of feathers, birds, and powered flight.

It was discovered by members of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Naturalistes dOyonnax, a group of amateur geologists specializing in the Jurassic, in 2009. Paleontologists from the Pal\u00e9oenvironnements et Pal\u00e9obiosph\u00e8re research unit at the Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University then confirmed that the Plagne trackway extends over 508 feet in length, which makes this specimen the longest sauropod trackway currently known in the world, a few feet longer than the Middle Jurassic sauropod trackways from Galinha, Portugal. The trackway is composed of 110 successive paces, and is generally well preserved. The prints measure between 3.3 and 10 feet 1 3 m in diameter. The footprints reveal five elliptical toe marks, while the handprints are characterized by five circular finger marks arranged in an arc. They were made by a sauropod, or long necked dinosaur, approximately 150 million years ago, during the Tithonian, the latest age of the Late Jurassic epoch. Paleogeographic reconstructions of Western Europe for this stage indicate an archipelago landscape, where the emergent islands were occasionally connected during periods of relatively low sea level, which presumably allowed faunal expansion or migration, the researchers said. Biometric analysis suggests the Plagne sauropod dinosaur was at least 115 feet 35 m long, weighted between 35 and 40 tons, had an average stride of 9.2 feet 2.8 m, and traveled at a speed of 2.5 mph 4 kmh. This new trackway site, alongside other Early Jurassic Swiss and French tracksites yielding thousands of sauropod and theropod tracks, can be considered as being the largest dinosaur megatracksite in Europe, the paleontologists said. They detailed their findings in the August 2017 issue of the journal Geobios.

The fossil forest dates back to the late Permian period some 260 million years ago. The Permian period ended 251 million years ago in historys greatest mass extinction, as the Earth rapidly shifted from icehouse to greenhouse conditions. More than 90 of species on Earth disappeared, including the polar forests, Dr. Gulbranson said. Because the Antarctic forests grew at polar latitudes where plants cant grow today, we believe that the trees were an extremely hearty species and are trying to determine why they went extinct. Dr. Gulbranson and colleagues found the fossil fragments of at least 13 trees. This forest is a glimpse of life before the extinction, which can help us understand what caused the event. It can also give clues to how plants were different than today, he said. At the end of the Permian period, Antarctica was part of the supercontinent Gondwana and was warmer and more humid than it is today. There would have been a mixture of mosses, ferns and an extinct plant called Glossopteris, and its likely that this forest stretched across the entirety of the supercontinent. The fossil forests looked different than forests today, Dr. Gulbranson noted. During the Permian period, forests were a potentially low diversity assemblage of different plant types with specific functions that affected how the entire forest responded to environmental change. This is contrast to modern high latitude forests that display greater plant diversity. This plant group must have been capable of surviving and thriving in a variety of environments. Its extremely rare, even today, for a group to appear across nearly an entire hemisphere of the globe. But not even these robust forests survived the high carbon dioxide concentrations of the mass extinction. The resilient plants also must have survived through the polar extremes of perpetual light and total darkness. Even in a warmer past, the polar regions would have experienced months of darkness in winter and would have gone without sunset during the summer months. By studying the preserved tree rings, the authors found that these trees transitioned from summer activity to winter dormancy rapidly, perhaps within a month. Modern plants make the same transition over the course of several months and also conserve water by making food during the day and resting at night. Scientists dont yet know how months of perpetual light would have affected the plants day and night cycles. There isnt anything like that today. These trees could turn their growing cycles on and off like a light switch, Dr. Gulbranson said.We know the winter shutoff happened right away, but we dont know how active they were during the summertime and if they could force themselves into dormancy while it was still light out."}, {"title": " Paleontologists Discover Two Mammals from Early Cretaceous Epoch", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Nov 8, 2017", "doc": "A group of paleontologists from the University of Portsmouth has discovered two new species of mammals that lived 145 million years ago in what is now Dorset county, southern England. The new fossil mammals, named Durlstotherium newmani and Durlstodon ensomi, lived alongside dinosaurs. They were small, furry creatures and most likely nocturnal. Durlstotherium newmani, a possible burrower, probably ate insects and Durlstodon ensomi may have eaten plants as well. Professor Dave Martill led the research team, which reports its findings in a paper published this week in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. The fossil remains two teeth of Durlstotherium newmani and Durlstodon ensomi were recovered from rocks exposed in cliffs near Swanage in Dorset, southern England. The teeth are of a type so highly evolved that I realized straight away I was looking at remains of Early Cretaceous mammals that more closely resembled those that lived during the latest Cretaceous  some 60 million years later in geological history, said co author Dr. Steve Sweetman, a research fellow at the University of Portsmouth. In the world of paleontology there has been a lot of debate around a specimen found in China, which is approximately 160 million years old, he added. This was originally said to be of the same type as ours but recent studies have ruled this out. That being the case, our 145 million year old teeth are undoubtedly the earliest yet known from the line of mammals that lead to our own species.  I knew I was looking at something mammalian but didnt realize I had discovered something quite so special, said co author Grant Smith, an undergraduate student at the University of Portsmouth. Professor Martill added we looked at them with a microscope but despite over 30 years experience these teeth looked very different and we decided we needed to bring in a third pair of eyes and more expertise in the field in the form of our colleague, Dr. Sweetman. Steve made the connection immediately, but what Im most pleased about is that a student who is a complete beginner was able to make a remarkable scientific discovery in paleontology and see his discovery and his name published in a scientific paper.

Lead author Roi Maor, a researcher at TAUs School of Zoology and UCLs Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, and colleagues analyzed data of 2,415 extant species of mammals using computer algorithms to reconstruct the likely activity patterns of their ancient ancestors. Two different mammalian family trees portraying alternative timelines for the evolution of mammals were used in the analysis. The results from both show that mammals switched to daytime activity shortly after non avian dinosaurs had disappeared. This change did not happen in an instant  it involved an intermediate stage of mixed day and night activity over millions of years, which coincided with the events that decimated the dinosaurs. We were very surprised to find such close correlation between the disappearance of dinosaurs and the beginning of daytime activity in mammals, but we found the same result unanimously using several alternative analyses, Maor said. The researchers found that the ancestors of simian primates  such as gorillas, gibbons and tamarins  were among the first to give up nocturnal activity altogether. However, the two evolutionary timelines varied, giving a window between 52 and 33 million years ago for this to have occurred. This discovery fits well with the fact that simian primates are the only mammals that have evolved adaptations to seeing well in daylight. The visual acuity and color perception of simians is comparable to those of diurnal reptiles and birds  groups that never left the daytime niche. Its very difficult to relate behavior changes in mammals that lived so long ago to ecological conditions at the time, so we cant say that the dinosaurs dying out caused mammals to start being active in the daytime, said co author Professor Kate Jones, from UCLs Genetics, Evolution  Environment. However, we see a clear correlation in our findings. We analyzed a lot of data on the behavior and ancestry of living animals for two reasons  firstly, because the fossil record from that era is very limited and secondly, behavior as a trait is very hard to infer from fossils, added co author Professor Tamar Dayan, Chair of TAUs Steinhardt Museum of Natural History. You have to observe a living mammal to see if it is active at night or in the day. Fossil evidence from mammals often suggest that they were nocturnal even if they were not. Many subsequent adaptations that allow us to live in daylight are in our soft tissues. The findings appear in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution.

The scientists speculate that this skewed ratio exists in the fossil record because inexperienced male mammoths more often traveled alone and got themselves killed by falling into natural traps that made their preservation more likely. Most bones, tusks, and teeth from mammoths and other Ice Age animals havent survived, said senior author Dr. Love Dalen, from the Swedish Museum of Natural History. It is highly likely that the remains that are found in Siberia these days have been preserved because they have been buried, and thus protected from weathering. Our findings imply that male mammoths more often died in a way that meant their remains were buried, perhaps by falling through lake ice in winter or getting stuck in bogs. For the study, Dr. Dalen and colleagues generated genomic data from 98 bone, tooth, and tusk samples collected at various locations throughout Siberia. They then used these data to determine the sex of the mammoth specimens. We were very surprised because there was no reason to expect a sex bias in the fossil record, said first author Dr. Patr\u00edcia Pe\u010dnerov\u00e1, also from the Swedish Museum of Natural History. Since the ratio of females to males was likely balanced at birth, we had to consider explanations that involved better preservation of male remains. The findings suggest that woolly mammoths lived similarly to modern elephants, with herds of females and young elephants led by an experienced adult female. In contrast, the authors suspect that male mammoths, like elephants, more often lived in bachelor groups or alone and engaged in more risk taking behavior. Without the benefit of living in a herd led by an experienced female, male mammoths may have had a higher risk of dying in natural traps such as bogs, crevices, and lakes, Dr. Dalen said. The findings are published in the journal Current Biology.

Decennatherium rex lived during the late Miocene epoch, approximately 9 million years ago, in what is now Spain. The animal belongs to the family Giraffidae giraffids, a group of ruminant artiodactyl mammals that includes modern day giraffes and okapis. Giraffids were much more diverse and widespread in the past, with more than 30 fossil species described, Dr. Rios and colleagues said. For the past decades a number of studies intended to resolve the phylogenetic relationships of giraffids, but due to the lack of fossilized skulls no clear consensus was reached regarding the phylogenetic relationships amongst the different members of the family. The exceptionally complete remains of Decennatherium rex allow us to improve and reassess giraffid systematics, offering a lot of new data, both anatomic and phylogenetic, on the large late Miocene giraffids. The paleontologists conducted a phylogenetic analysis to help elucidate evolutionary patterns. The results suggest that the genus Decennatherium may have been the most basal branch of a clade of now extinct giraffids containing both sivatheres, the largest known giraffids, and samotheres, whose appearance was somewhere in between that of okapis and giraffes, they said. All giraffids in this group feature four horn like skull protuberances known as ossicones, two over the eyes and two larger ridged ossicones at the back of its head. Decennatherium rex was likely the earliest evolving example of this ossicone layout. The inclusion of this species in the sivathere samothere clade would extend its timespan back to the early late Miocene and its range as far as the Iberian Peninsula, making the clade one of the most successful and long lived of all the giraffids. The discovery of Decennatherium rex is reported in the journal PLoS ONE.

Matheronodon provincialis was a primitive cousin of the well known European dinosaur Iguanodon. The ancient beast lived 70 million years ago Late Cretaceous epoch and was approximately 16 feet 5 m long. The fossilized jawbone and three teeth of the new species were discovered at the site of Velaux La Bastide Neuve, Bouches du Rh\u00f4ne Department, southern France. Matheronodon provincialis had extremely enlarged teeth, up to 2.4 inches 6 cm long and 2 inches 5 cm wide. They operated like self sharpening serrated scissors, said Dr. Koen Stein, a paleontologist at Free University of Brussels, Belgium. Its teeth have ridged surfaces but are only covered with a thick enamel layer on one side. Because the enamel is more resistant to wear than the exposed dentine, chewing actually keeps the teeth sharp. The denture of rhabdodontid dinosaurs Rhabdodontidae had evolved in a different direction than that of their contemporaries, the hadrosaurs or duck billed dinosaurs, said Dr. Pascal Godefroit, a paleontologist at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. Hadrosaurs had sophisticated dental batteries formed by little teeth with which they could crush conifers. Matheronodon provincialis and other Rhabdodontidae probably ate leaves of palm trees, which were abundant in Europe at that time. They had to cut rather than crush the fiber rich leaves, before they could swallow them. Research describing the new species is published online in the journal Scientific Reports.

Ichthyosaurs were predatory marine reptiles that ranged in size from 1 to 69 feet 0.3 21 m long. They swam the worlds oceans for millions of years during the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Despite their profound adaptations to the aquatic realm, these reptiles disappeared about 30 million years before the end Cretaceous mass extinction 65 million years ago that marked the end for dinosaurs and the beginning of the age of mammals. While many ichthyosaur fossils have been found in North American and Europe, in the Southern Hemisphere, their fossil record has mostly been limited to South America and Australia. Now, Dr. Guntupalli Prasad from the University of Delhi and co authors report what they believe to be the first Jurassic ichthyosaur found in India. The skeleton was found in the Upper Jurassic Katrol Formation exposed at a site south of the village Lodai in Kachchh district, Gujarat. The specimen is approximately 18 feet 5.5 m long and belongs to a previously unknown genus and species of the ichthyosaur family Ophthalmosauridae. It was found among fossils of ammonites and squid like belemnites, and its tooth wear patterns suggest it predated such hard, abrasive animals. This is a remarkable discovery not only because it is the first Jurassic ichthyosaur record from India, but also it throws light on the evolution and diversity of ichthyosaurs in the Indo Madagascan region of the former Gondwanaland and Indias biological connectivity with other continents in the Jurassic, Dr. Prasad said.

The research is published in the journal Current Biology. Far from all being the lumbering prehistoric grey beasts of past childrens books, at least some dinosaurs showed sophisticated color patterns to hide from and confuse predators, just like todays animals, said co author Dr. Fiann Smithwick, from the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Bristol. Vision was likely very important in dinosaurs, just like todays birds, and so it is not surprising that they evolved elaborate color patterns. To explore the color pattern of Sinosauropteryx prima, Dr. Smithwick and colleagues examined the remnants of pigmented feathers from the best preserved specimens available. By making comparisons among three specimens, they were able to confidently reconstruct the unique way that this dinosaur looked. The bandit mask was really amazing to discover. Its a pattern seen in numerous living animals today, Dr. Smithwick said. Sinosauropteryx prima was also countershaded, meaning that its body was darker on top and lighter underneath. The particular way it was countershaded further suggests that the dinosaur lived in more open habitats, not in the dense forest. Once the paleontologists reconstructed the color pattern, they created 3D models of the dinosaur and photographed them under different lighting conditions to see where their coloration would have hidden them best from potential predators. Their images show that Sinosauropteryx prima must have spent lots of time out in direct sunlight, not in the shade. The findings are especially interesting in light of an earlier reconstruction by the team of the color patterns of Psittacosaurus, an early relative of the famed horned dinosaur Triceratops. Those studies showed that Psittacosaurus was also countershaded, but in a manner suggesting that it lived in the forest. The distinction between species suggests that the environment around Chinas prehistoric Jehol lakes, where these dinosaurs lived, was unexpectedly diverse, hosting dinosaurs adapted to life in different environments. We have shown how a greater understanding of ancient environments can come from better understanding of the paleoecology of extinct animals through paleocolor reconstructions, said study senior author Dr. Jakob Vinther, from the Schools of Earth and Biological Sciences at the University of Bristol. Both meat  and plant eating dinosaurs had excellent vision both needed to stay camouflaged.

The xylem is responsible for conducting water from a trees roots to its branches and leaves. In the most familiar trees it forms a single cylinder to which new growth is added in rings year by year just under the bark. In other trees, notably palms, xylem is formed in strands embedded in softer tissues throughout the trunk. Earths earliest trees Cladoxylopsida had their xylem dispersed in strands in the outer 5 cm of the tree trunk only, whilst the middle of the trunk was completely hollow, according to paleontologists who analyzed silicified trunks of the Late Devonian 374 million years ago cladoxylopsid tree Xinicaulis lignescens. The narrow strands of Xinicaulis lignescens were arranged in an organized fashion and were interconnected to each other like a finely tuned network of water pipes, the researchers said. The development of these strands allowed the trees overall growth. Rather than the tree laying down one growth ring under the bark every year, each of the hundreds of individual strands were growing their own rings, like a large collection of mini trees. As the strands got bigger, and the volume of soft tissues between the strands increased, the diameter of the tree trunk expanded. The connections between each of the strands would split apart in a curiously controlled and self repairing way to accommodate the growth. At the very bottom of the tree there was also a peculiar mechanism at play  as the trees diameter expanded the woody strands rolled out from the side of the trunk at the base of the tree, forming the characteristic flat base and bulbous shape synonymous with the cladoxylopsids. There is no other tree that I know of in the history of the Earth that has ever done anything as complicated as this, added co author Dr. Chris Berry, of Cardiff University. The tree simultaneously ripped its skeleton apart and collapsed under its own weight while staying alive and growing upwards and outwards to become the dominant plant of its day. By studying these extremely rare fossils, weve gained an unprecedented insight into the anatomy of our earliest trees and the complex growth mechanisms that they employed. This raises a provoking question why are the very oldest trees the most complicated? The research appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The newly discovered three toed footprints, named Kayentapus ambrokholohali, are 22 inches 57 cm long and 20 inches 50 cm wide. They belong to a megatheropod giant two legged carnivorous dinosaurs, such as the iconic Tyrannosaurus rex that lived 200 million year ago in southern Africa. University of Manchester paleontologist Fabien Knoll and co authors estimate that the dinosaur was a little less than 10 feet 3 m tall and 30 feet 9 m long, which is smaller than T. rex. This discovery is very exciting and sheds new light on the kind of carnivore that roamed what is now southern Africa, Dr. Knoll said. Thats because it is the first evidence of an extremely large meat eating animal roaming a landscape otherwise dominated by a variety of herbivorous, omnivorous and much smaller carnivorous dinosaurs. It really would have been top of the food chain. What makes the discovery even more important is that these footprints date back to the Early Jurassic epoch, when it was thought the size of most theropod dinosaurs was considerably smaller. On average they were previously thought to be around 10 16 feet 3 5 m in body length, with some records showing they may have reached 23 feet 7 m at the very most. It is only much later in the Jurassic and during the Cretaceous, which starts 145 million years ago, that truly large forms of theropods, such as T. rex, appear in body and trace fossil records. This discovery marks the first occurrence of very large carnivorous dinosaurs in the Early Jurassic of southern Gondwana, said Dr. Lara Sciscio, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cape Town. This makes it a significant find. Globally, these large tracks are very rare. There is only one other known site similar in age and sized tracks, which is in Poland. The ancient surface where these footprints were found is also covered with the tracks of much smaller theropod dinosaurs. In South Africa, Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Namibia, there is good record of theropod footprints from the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic epochs, Dr. Knoll said. In fact, there are numerous palaeosurfaces where footprints and even tail and body impressions of these, and other animals, can be found. But now we have evidence this region of Africa was also home to a mega carnivore. A paper reporting this discovery is published in the journal PLoS ONE.

Published in the journal Current Biology, the results suggest that these iconic felids diverged from each other about 18 million years ago and shared a common ancestor with all living cat like species about 20 million years ago. Its quite crazy that, in terms of their mitochondrial DNA mtDNA, these two saber toothed cats are more distant from each other than tigers are from house cats, said lead author Dr. Johanna Paijmans, from the University of Potsdam in Germany. Dr. Paijmans and co authors reconstructed the mitochondrial genomes from ancient DNA samples representing three Homotherium from Europe and North America and one specimen of Smilodon populator. The Smilodon sample was collected in Chile and is dated to 11,335 years. Two Homotherium fossils were collected in northwest Canada. The European Homotherium was recovered from the North Sea and is dated to 28,000 years. One of the Homotherium specimens under investigation is a unique fossil a 28,000 year old mandible recovered from the North Sea, Dr. Paijmans said. This find was so special because Homotherium is generally believed to have gone extinct in Europe around 300,000 years ago, so this specimen is over 200,000 years younger than the next to youngest Homotherium find in Europe. The new DNA evidence confirmed that this surprisingly young specimen did indeed belong to a Homotherium. The discovery suggests that the saber toothed cats continued to live in Europe much more recently than paleontologists previously thought. Mitochondrial DNA that we recovered from the North Sea Homotherium specimen confirms the Late Pleistocene survival of this enigmatic saber toothed cat in Eurasia, Dr. Paijmans and colleagues said. Much like Denisovan hominins, the North Sea Homotherium represents another striking example of the major gaps in our knowledge of Pleistocene fauna composition on the Eurasian continent and holds important clues about population and extinction dynamics of Pleistocene species. We also found a deep divergence between Smilodon and Homotherium 18 million years, but limited diversity between the American and European Homotherium specimens, the scientists said. The genetic data support the hypothesis that all Late Pleistocene Homotherium should be considered a single species, Homotherium latidens, which was previously proposed based on morphological data. This study highlights the importance of combining morphological and genetic information for species identification, they concluded.

Published in the journal Scientific Reports, the study provides direct evidence that a pigment based survival trait common to modern sea turtles evolved at least 54 million years ago. The extremely well preserved hatchling of Tasbacka danica was collected in 2008 from within a limestone concretion in the Ejerslev Mo clay pit on the Isle of Mors, Denmark. The specimen is less than 3 inches 7.4 cm long. In 2013, Lund University paleontologist Johan Lindgren and colleagues uncovered soft tissue residues from an area located near the sea turtles left shoulder. They then investigated the microscopic and molecular contents of soft tissues retrieved from the fossil. Our results show that a number of biomolecules, which can be directly linked to the animal itself, are preserved in an identifiable form, Dr. Lindgren said. The researchers identified residues of several different molecules, including beta keratin, hemoglobin, tropomyosin, and eumelanin a pigment that provides dark skin color also in humans. Our results indicate that the baby turtle had the same color patterns 54 million years ago as they do today, that is, a dark back with lightpale edges, they said. This coloration is an adaptation that provides protection against harmful UV radiation from the Sun, but they also use the dark skin to increase their body heat, thereby growing faster. This phenomenon is called adaptive melanism and entails the animals ability to utilize color for survival purposes. The presence of eukaryotic melanin within a melanosome embedded in a keratin matrix rules out contamination by microbes, because microbes cannot make eukaryotic melanin or keratin, said co author Professor Mary Schweitzer, of North Carolina State University and Lund University. So we know that these hatchlings had the dark coloration common to modern sea turtles. The data not only support the preservation of multiple proteins, but also suggest that coloration was used for physiology as far back as the Eocene, in the same manner as it is today. The discovery of several biomolecules could, eventually, enable researchers to study the evolution of life at the molecular level through geological time. We have previously identified eumelanin in fossilized skin, but the fact that the organic matter from this baby turtle contained such a wide range of identifiable biomolecular remains came as a big surprise, Dr. Lindgren said. Furthermore, the results of the study call for a revision of what fossils actually are and what they consist of. Fossils are not only petrifactions, but can sometimes consist of parts of the original biological material, Dr. Lindgren said.

The new carnivore is named Pakakali rukwaensis and belongs to an extinct lineage of placental mammals called Hyaenodonta hyaenodonts. The fossil was unearthed in the fossil rich beds of the Nsungwe Formation in southwestern Tanzania. As reported in the journal PLoS ONE, it gives paleontologists a glimpse of hyaenodont anatomy before modern carnivores invaded the African continent, revealing that Pakakali rukwaensis was about the size of a bobcat. After the extinction of the non avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago, hyaenodonts were the main predators on the African continent, said Ohio University paleontologists Nancy Stevens and Matthew Borths. Between 23 and 25 million years ago, ancient relatives of modern dogs, cats and hyenas arrived in Africa, where they coexisted with hyaenodonts for millions of years. But eventually, hyaenodonts went extinct. Pakakali rukwaensis provides new information  based on teeth, biogeography and phylogenetic analysis  about the transition of carnivores in older ecosystem types to carnivores in todays African ecosystems, said Dr. Judy Skog, program director in the National Science Foundations Division of Earth Sciences, which funded the research. The shift from hyaenodonts to modern carnivores in Africa is like a controlled experiment, Dr. Borths added. We start with only hyaenodonts. Then the relatives of cats and dogs arrive. They coexist for a few million years, then the hyaenodonts are driven to extinction and were left with The Lion King. With Pakakali rukwaensis, we can start to unravel that extinction. Were the lineages competing? Were they adapting differently to a drier, more open landscape?  According to the team, Pakakali rukwaensis was discovered in the same rocks as the oldest fossil evidence of the split between Old World monkeys and apes. At that time, the ecosystem was undergoing dramatic climate and tectonic upheavals as Africa collided with Eurasia and the modern East African Rift System formed. Based on the findings of the study, hyaenodonts may have been pushed to become more specialized meat eaters due to competition from other species, the paleontologists explained. That dietary specialization may have made hyaenodonts more vulnerable to extinction in the changing African ecosystem by leaving them with fewer food choices. The environment containing Pakakali rukwaensis reveals a fascinating window into extinction. It highlights the vulnerability of carnivorous species to rapid environmental change, a topic we are grappling with on the African continent today, Dr. Stevens said.

Measuring 10 feet 3 m from snout to tail, it hunted large bodied prey, such as prehistoric squid, in the warm, shallow seas that covered much of what is now Europe. Ieldraan melkshamensis would have been one of the top predators in the oceans of Jurassic Britain, at the same time that dinosaurs were thundering across the land, said Dr. Steve Brusatte, a vertebrate paleontologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh.

Until now, it was thought that Geosaurini originated in the Late Jurassic period, between 152 and 157 million years ago. However, the latest discovery  together with detailed re analysis of existing fossil evidence  suggests that this sub family arose millions of years earlier, in the Middle Jurassic. Its not the prettiest fossil in the world, but Ieldraan melkshamensis tells us a very important story about the evolution of these ancient crocodiles and how they became the apex predators in their ecosystem, said Davide Foffa, a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh.

The ichthyosaur fossil has a total length of just 27.5 inches 70 cm and is approximately 199 196 million years old Early Jurassic epoch. University of Manchester paleontologist Dean Lomax and colleagues identified it as a newborn Ichthyosaurus communis, based on the arrangement of bones in the skull. It is amazing to think we know what a creature that is nearly 200 million years old ate for its last meal, Lomax said. We found many tiny hook like structures preserved between the ribs. These are from the arms of prehistoric squid. So, we know this animals last meal before it died was squid. This is interesting because a study by other researchers on a different type of ichthyosaur, called Stenopterygius, which is from a geologically younger age, found that the small  and therefore young  examples of that species fed exclusively on fish. This shows a difference in prey preference in newborn ichthyosaurs. The new specimen of Ichthyosaurus communis is from the collections of the Lapworth Museum of Geology, University of Birmingham. There are several small Ichthyosaurus specimens known, but most are incomplete or poorly preserved. This specimen is practically complete and is exceptional, Lomax said. It is the first newborn Ichthyosaurus communis to be found, which is surprising considering that the species was first described almost 200 years ago. The research is published in the journal Historical Biology.

Two herpes simplex viruses infect primates from unknown evolutionary depths. In modern humans these manifest as cold sores HSV1 and genital herpes HSV2. Unlike HSV1, however, the earliest proto humans did not take HSV2 with them when our ancient lineage split from chimpanzee precursors around 7 million years ago. Humanity dodged the genital herpes bullet  almost. Somewhere between 3 and 1.4 million years ago, HSV2 jumped the species barrier from African apes back into human ancestors. Now, Dr. Charlotte Houldcroft of the University of Cambridge and co authors believe they may have identified the culprit the Plio Pleistocene hominin Paranthropus boisei, also known as the Nutcracker Man because of his enormous, flat, thickly enameled cheek teeth, a robust skull and massive, powerful chewing muscles. Paranthropus boisei most likely contracted HSV2 through scavenging ancestral chimp meat where savannah met forest, the researchers said. Hominins with HSV1 may have been initially protected from HSV2, which also occupied the mouth. That is until HSV2 adapted to a different mucosal niche. Close contact between Paranthropus boisei and our ancestor Homo erectus would have been fairly common around sources of water, such as Kenyas Lake Turkana. This provided the opportunity for HSV2 to boomerang into our bloodline. The appearance of Homo erectus around 2 million years ago was accompanied by evidence of hunting and butchery. Once again, consuming infected material would have transmitted HSV2  only this time it was Paranthropus boisei being devoured. Herpes infect everything from humans to coral, with each species having its own specific set of viruses, Dr. Houldcroft said. For these viruses to jump species barriers they need a lucky genetic mutation combined with significant fluid exchange. In the case of early hominins, this means through consumption or intercourse  or possibly both. By modeling the available data, from fossil records to viral genetics, we believe that Paranthropus boisei was the species in the right place at the right time to both contract HSV2 from ancestral chimpanzees, and transmit it to our earliest ancestors, probably Homo erectus.

Trilobites are a group of extinct marine arthropods that form the class Trilobita. They appeared in ancient oceans in the Early Cambrian Period, about 540 million years ago  well before life emerged on land, and disappeared in the mass extinction at the end of the Permian, about 252 million years ago. They were extremely diverse, with about 20,000 species, and their fossil exoskeletons can be found all around the world. Previous studies suggest that two body plans existed for trilobite digestive systems i a tube that runs down the length of the trilobites body with lateral digestive glands that would have helped process the food or ii an expanded stomach, called a crop, leading into a simple tube with no lateral glands. Until now, only the first type had been reported from the earliest trilobites. Based on this, paleontologists had proposed that the evolution of the crop came later in trilobite evolutionary history and represented a distinct type of digestive system. Trilobites are one of the first types of animals to show up in large numbers in the fossil record, said Dr. Melanie Hopkins, an assistant curator in the Division of Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. Their exoskeletons were heavy in minerals, and so they preserved really well. But like all fossils, its very rare to see the preservation of soft tissues like organs or appendages in trilobites, and because of this, our knowledge of the trilobite digestive system comes from a small number of specimens. The new material  270 specimens from the Wulongqing Formation  really expands our understanding. The new Wulongqing specimens are dated to the early Cambrian, about 514 million years ago. They belong to two trilobite species, Palaeolenus lantenoisi and Redlichia mansuyi, and about 20 of them show soft body preservation. Contradictory to the previously proposed body plans, Dr. Hopkins and co authors identified crops in Palaeolenus lantenoisi and Redlichia mansuyi. In addition, at least one specimen of Palaeolenus lantenoisi has both a crop and digestive glands  suggesting that the evolution of trilobite digestive systems is more complex than originally proposed. This is a very rigorous study based on multiple specimens, and it shows that we should start thinking about this aspect of trilobite biology and evolution in a different way, Dr. Hopkins said. The study is published in the journal PLoS ONE.

There is good evidence that size reductions after mass extinctions may have occurred in many groups of organisms, said Cornell University Ph.D. candidate Jacob Berv, lead author on the study, published in the journal Systematic Biology. All of the new evidence we have reviewed is also consistent with a Lilliput Effect affecting birds across the Cretaceous Tertiary mass extinction also called K Pg extinction, K T extinction, Cretaceous Paleogene extinction or end Cretaceous extinction. Smaller birds tend to have faster metabolic rates and shorter generation times, added co author Dr. Daniel Field, an evolutionary paleobiologist at the University of Bath, UK. Our hypothesis is that these important biological characters, which affect the rate of DNA evolution, may have been influenced by the Cretaceous Tertiary event. The team jumped into this line of inquiry because of the long running rocks and clocks debate. Different studies often report substantial discrepancies between age estimates for groups of organisms implied by the fossil record and estimates generated by molecular clocks. Molecular clocks use the rate at which DNA sequences change to estimate how long ago new species arose, assuming a relatively steady rate of genetic evolution. But if the Cretaceous Tertiary extinction caused avian molecular clocks to temporarily speed up, this could explain at least some of the mismatch, the authors said. Size reductions across this extinction would be predicted to do exactly that, Berv said. The bottom line is that, by speeding up avian genetic evolution, the Cretaceous Tertiary mass extinction may have temporarily altered the rate of the avian molecular clock, Dr. Field added. Similar processes may have influenced the evolution of many groups across this extinction event, like plants, mammals, and other forms of life. The researchers also suggest that human activity may even be driving a similar Lilliput like pattern in the modern world, as more and more large animals go extinct because of hunting, habitat destruction, and climate change. Right now, the planets large animals are being decimated  the big cats, elephants, rhinos, and whales. We need to start thinking about conservation not just in terms of functional biodiversity loss, but about how our actions will affect the future of evolution itself, Berv said. "}, {"title": " Giant Prehistoric Frogs Ate Small Dinosaurs, Claim Scientists", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Sep 20, 2017", "doc": "Exceptionally large individuals of Beelzebufo ampinga, an extinct species of frog that lived in Madagascar during the Late Cretaceous epoch, about 68 million years ago, were capable of eating small dinosaurs, according to an international research team led by California State Polytechnic University scientists. This conclusion comes from a study of the bite force of extant South American horned frogs genus Ceratophrys. Unlike the vast majority of frogs which have weak jaws and typically consume small prey, horned frogs ambush animals as large as themselves  including other frogs, snakes, and rodents, explained co author Dr. Marc Jones, from the University of Adelaide and the South Australian Museum. And their powerful jaws play a critical role in grabbing and subduing the prey. Dr. Jones and co authors from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia found that small horned frogs, with head width of about 1.8 inches 4.5 cm, can bite with a force of 30 newtons N, or about 3 kg6.6 lbs. A scaling experiment, comparing bite force with head and body size, calculated that large horned frogs that are found in the tropical and subtropical moist lowland forests of South America, with a head width of up to 4 inches 10 cm, would have a bite force of almost 500 N. This is comparable to reptiles and mammals with a similar head size. This would feel like having 50 liters of water balanced on your fingertip, explained lead author Professor Kristopher Lappin, of California State Polytechnic University. Many people find horned frogs hilarious because of their big heads and fat, round bodies, said co author Sean Wilcox, a PhD candidate at the University of California, Riverside. Yet, these predators have given us a rare opportunity to learn something more about the biology of a huge extinct frog. The team estimated the bite force of the extinct frog Beelzebufo ampinga may have had a bite up to 2,200 N, comparable to formidable mammalian predators such as wolves and female tigers. At this bite force, Beelzebufo ampinga would have been capable of subduing the small and juvenile dinosaurs that shared its environment, Dr. Jones said. This is the first time bite force has been measured in a frog, Professor Lappin said. And, speaking from experience, horned frogs have quite an impressive bite, and they tend not to let go. The bite of a large Beelzebufo ampinga would have been remarkable, definitely not something I would want to experience firsthand. The study appears today in the journal Scientific Reports. "}, {"title": " Ancient Primitive Amphibians Had Mouthful of Teeth, New Research Finds", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Sep 18, 2017", "doc": "Temnospondyls  a diverse group of extinct small to giant amphibians that flourished worldwide during the Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic periods  had a full array of teeth, large fangs and thousands of tiny hook like structures called denticles on the roofs of their mouths, according to new research published in the journal PeerJ. Denticles are significantly smaller than the teeth around the margin of the mouth  on the order of dozens to a couple hundred microns in length, said University of Toronto Mississauga Professor Robert Reisz, senior author of the study. They have all of the features of the large teeth that are found on the margin of the mouth. In many vertebrates, ranging from fish to early synapsids ancestors of mammals, denticles are commonly found in dense concentrations on the bones of the hard palate roof of the mouth. However, in temnospondyls  which are thought to be the ancestors of modern amphibians  these denticles were also found on small, bony plates that filled the large soft part of the palate. The entire roof of the mouth was covered with literally thousands of these tiny teeth that they used to grab prey. In examining temnospondyl specimens dating back approximately 289 million years Permian period, we discovered that the denticles display essentially all of the main features that are considered to define teeth, including enamel and dentine, pulp cavity and peridontia, Professor Reisz said. He and his colleagues  Bryan Gee and Yara Haridy, graduate students at the University of Toronto Mississauga  analyzed specimens unearthed from the Dolese Brothers Limestone Quarry near Richards Spur, Oklahoma. They extracted and isolated the denticle bearing plates, created thin section slides and examined them under the microscope. The presence of such an extensive field of teeth provides clues to how the intriguing feeding mechanism seen in modern amphibians was also likely used by their ancient ancestors, the paleontologists said. We believe that the tooth bearing plates were ideally suited for holding on to prey, such as insects or smaller tetrapods, may have facilitated a method of swallowing prey items via retraction of the eyeballs into the mouth, as some amphibians do today. The next big question relates to evolutionary changes to the overall abundance of teeth if these ancient amphibians had an astonishing number of teeth, why have most modern amphibians reduced or entirely lost their teeth?

The new species is named Linguamyrmex vladi and belongs to the tribe Haidomyrmecini unicorn or hell ants. It lived about 98 million years ago during the Cenomanian, the earliest age of the Late Cretaceous epoch. All studied specimens were mined from the Hukawng Valley in Kachin State, Republic of the Union of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. Dr. Phillip Barden, a researcher at the American Museum of Natural History and the New Jersey Institute of Technology, and co authors probed the burmite pieces using several types of imaging technology, including light microscopes and X ray micro computed tomography micro CT scanning. Linguamyrmex vladi is distinguished by an unusual suite of morphological characters indicating specialized predatory behavior and an adaptive strategy no longer found among modern ant lineages, the researchers said. The species had oversized, scythe like mandibles and a horn like appendage reinforced with metal, the team found. Insects are known to sequester metals  in particular, calcium, manganese, zinc, and iron  in ovipositors and mandibles, to increase strength and reduce wear, they said. Scan results indicate that the underside of Linguamyrmex vladis clypeal paddle appears to be reinforced, either by greater cuticular density or, more likely, through the incorporation of metals into cuticle. Dr. Barden and co authors believe this fortified horn was utilized in tandem with scythe like mandibles to pin and potentially puncture soft bodied prey. The mandibles and paddle of Linguamyrmex vladi may have functioned to puncture soft bodied prey and feed on the hemolymph, they explained. Although this would be a novel strategy, this morphological arrangement is itself entirely novel and it is not at all apparent how these ants could otherwise masticate food items. Although it is obtained from their own larvae, some living ant species do utilize hemolymph as a food source. Foragers of Linguamyrmex vladi probably hunted with their mandibles cocked wide open and gaping, quickly snapping shut vertically when the tips of the trigger hairs touched prey, evidently with sufficient force that, were the clypeal paddle not reinforced, it might have been damaged. Although it may not be possible to definitively ascertain the behavior of Linguamyrmex vladi, this new species highlights the adaptive diversity of a highly specialized, extinct lineage of Cretaceous, stem group ants, the scientists said. Just as the diversity and adaptive spectrum of carnivorous theropod dinosaurs could not have been predicted by the study of modern vertebrates alone, the bizarre adaptations of hell ants indeed, their existence would remain unknown if not for preservation in amber.

The Nemegt Formation is one of the richest dinosaur producing formations in the world. At least 30 genera are known from this formation, including ankylosaurs, hadrosaurs, sauropods, and theropods, the researchers said. The abundance of these deposits has unfortunately attracted the attention of fossil poachers, and dozens of poached skeletons are suspected to hail from the Nemegt Formation. In 2006, Mongolian customs officers confiscated two important poached specimens. One of the specimens is a spectacular block of three articulated skeletons of juvenile oviraptors. According to the team, the three young individuals belong to a whole new species, characterized by a domed cranial crest, a functionally didactyl hand, and a short tail. Its a fantastic specimen. Its rare to find a skeleton preserved in life position, so having two complete individuals and parts of a third is really incredible, Funston said. The three oviraptors were roughly the same age, preserved in a sleeping posture, so close to each other that they would have been touching in life. Known as communal roosting, this behavior is seen in many birds today including chickens and pigeons. The evolutionary origins of communal roosting in modern birds are debated, and this specimen highlights the possibility that this behavior was inherited from their dinosaurian ancestors, the paleontologists said. In addition to the skeletons in the block, the second poached skeleton is an even younger individual of the same species. It further fleshes out the life history of these animals, Funston and co authors said. The notable head crest is present even at a young age, but the dinosaurs would have had gradually shorter tails as they aged, and some of their bones fused across their lifetime. Their head crests and tails have been argued to represent sexual display features used in mating, somewhat similar to modern peacocks or turkeys.

The cave bear was a massive omnivore that lived in Europe during the Pleistocene epoch and became extinct approximately 25,000 years ago. Despite their name, cave bears didnt actually live in caves but only used them for hibernation. Nevertheless, the occasional death of animals in various caves in Europe over several tens of thousands of years eventually led to enormous accumulations of bones and teeth. The animal weighed between 500 and 1,100 pounds 225 500 kg, was 8.9 11.5 feet 2.7 3.5 m long and up to 5.6 feet 1.7 m at the shoulder. The massive grinding molars and nitrogen isotope data from its bones indicate that the cave bear was primarily herbivorous, with foliage its main dietary staple. Cave bears and people likely encountered one another occasionally. Most paleontologists think that the cave bears fell victim to the profound environmental changes following the glaciers withdrawal from Europe rather than human hunting. Collecting data on relative brain size for present day and extinct bears, University of Z\u00fcrich paleontologist Kristof Veitschegger found that the cave bear had an unusually small brain relative to its body size. Zoologists use a measure known as the encephalization quotient EQ to express this ratio, Veitschegger explained. I collected and investigated a dataset of 412 brain and body size estimates based on the skulls of 10 extant and extinct bear species, he said. EQ of cave bears is significantly lower than that of most other species. Cave bears exhibit an EQ of 0.60, which is considerably lower than the one of brown bears 0.83 or the one of Malayan sun bears 1.31. Veitschegger interprets this as evidence that the increase in body size during the evolution of the cave bear did not correlate with change in brain size. However, the proportionately small brain may also reflect a less energy rich diet  as other bears consume more animal protein  and a highly seasonal environment that probably required longer periods of hibernation. Cave bears gave birth to numerous cubs after long gestation periods, according to the researcher. Based on relative brain size, I hypothesize that cave bears had a small birth and weaning weight but produced many cubs and had a prolonged gestation time, he said. His examination of the microscopic structure of their leg bones indicates that cave bears grew more rapidly but attained sexual maturity later in life than other bear species. Longevity estimates based on cementum analysis of 95 cave bear teeth from 21 localities provided a minimum age of 29 years for cave bears, Veitschegger said.

While Morturneria seymourensis was obviously a plesiosaur, it was unlike any previously found. Now, three decades later, Professor Chatterjee and colleagues have made a new discovery about Morturneria seymourensis, one that adds a new dimension to our understanding of plesiosaurs. Plesiosaurs near to lizard in Greek are a group of extinct marine reptiles that roamed the vast seas of the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, between 235 and 66 million years ago. Their fossils have been found on every continent on Earth, with key discoveries made in Australia, Europe and North America. They had a broad, flat body and short tail, four long flippers they used to fly through the water, long necks and very sharp teeth. The teeth of most plesiosaurs are conical, stout, sharp, robust and ideal for stabbing and killing large animals, Professor Chatterjee said. But as he wrote in his 1989 paper, the long, slender and delicate teeth of Morturneria seymourensis may have formed a trapping device that enabled the animal to feed on small fish and crustaceans that abound in the same deposits. In our paper, we described the unusual teeth of Morturneria seymourensis and their probable function, Professor Chatterjee said. However, our new team, who had worked on plesiosaurs from many continents, found them fascinating and unique. The paleontologists reconstructed Morturneria seymourensis with a large, round head, a huge mouth and tiny teeth that point the wrong way. The teeth did not meet tip to tip as in all other plesiosaurs, but lay together in a battery that strained food particles from the water. When the jaw was closed, teeth from the upper and lower jaws formed a nice trap, Professor Chatterjee said. Basically, the animal would swallow a school of krill, close the jaws to let the water out, but keep the krill inside for chewing and swallowing. With these kind of interdigitating delicate teeth, the animal could not tackle the large fish or shelled animals called ammonites that were the favorite foods of most plesiosaurs. The major finding is that Morturneria seymourensis used a filter feeding method. This feeding style is unknown in other marine reptiles, but is found in todays baleen whales. The identification of Morturneria seymourensis whale like filter feeding is a startling case of convergent evolution between reptiles and mammals, Professor Chatterjee said. Plesiosaurs and whales shared many of the intervening steps in the evolution of this feeding style and their extreme morphologies are similar despite arising from different ancestors. Convergent evolution does not imply Morturneria seymourensis was in any way related to todays baleen whales it just means they both evolved the same way. They had adopted similar lifestyle and feeding. For example, birds and bats fly, but birds are now considered dinosaurs and bats are mammals, he said.

Called Aepyornithomimus tugrikinensis, the new dinosaur is a type of ornithomimosaur Ornithomimidae, a group of theropods that evolved a toothless beak and were likely omnivorous or herbivorous, superficially resembling extant ostriches. The ancient creature lived in what is now Mongolia during the Campanian, the fifth of six ages of the Late Cretaceous epoch. The fossil remains of the beast were found in the eolian deposits of the Djadokhta Formation at the T\u00f6gr\u00f6giin Shiree locality. They were analyzed by Dr. Chinzorig Tsogtbaatar, a paleontologist from Hokkaido University and the Institute of Paleontology and Geology at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, and his colleagues from Japan, Mongolia and Canada. This is only the third ornithomimosaur specimen reported from the Djadokhta Formation and is the first ornithomimid record from eolian T\u00f6gr\u00f6giin Shiree locality, the researchers said. It is also the best preserved specimen of all of aforementioned three specimens known to date, and it provides new insight into ornithomimid dinosaur evolution and paleoenvironment. It is possible that Aepyornithomimus tugrikinensis is a transitional form between the basal and derived ornithomimosaurs, they added. The dinosaur could be stratigraphically the oldest known ornithomimid occurrence in the Upper Cretaceous of Asia, and the easternmost occurrence of ornithomimid dinosaurs from the Campanian in the northern hemisphere. According to Dr. Tsogtbaatar and co authors, the discovery of Aepyornithomimus tugrikinensis sheds light on the evolutionary adaptation of ornithomimosaurs to arid environments. Aepyornithomimus tugrikinensis is possibly the first evidence of an ornithomimosaur species that could have tolerated more diverse climatic conditions that were shifting from humid to more arid conditions, they said.

Contrary to what many people thought, it seems that that whales never used their teeth as a sieve, and instead evolved their signature filter feeding strategy only later  maybe after their teeth had already been lost, said lead author Dr. Alistair Evans, a senior lecturer at Monash University and an honorary associate at Museum Victoria. To find out what the teeth of archaic whales were really capable of, Dr. Evans and co authors compared them to both filter feeding seals and a range of modern predators, like dingoes and lions. We first generated high resolution 3D surface models of the cheek teeth of five modern pinnipeds including leopard and crabeater seals, four terrestrial carnivorans, and eight fossil cetaceans five toothed mysticetes, including Janjucetus and Coronodon the fossil shark toothed dolphin Squalodon and two archaeocetes, the researchers explained. For each tooth, we then measured the sharpness of the anterior, posterior, labial and lingual sides of the main cusp, the tip of the main cusp and the first posterior notch. Next, we scaled all measurements and subjected them to principal component analysis to determine which extant tooth morphologies and feeding styles fossil cetaceans most closely associate with. Finally, we used Discriminant Function Analysis to distinguish extant tooth morphologies used for raptorial and suction filter feeding. The team found that ancient whales had sharp teeth similar to lions and dingoes. Its likely they used their teeth to kill rather than filter, Dr. Evans said. Predators that kill and chew their prey need sharp teeth with cutting blades. By contrast, species that use their teeth as a sieve have blunt teeth with rounded edges that help to filter prey from water. Our findings provide crucial new insights into how the biggest animals ever evolved their most important trait  filter feeding, he said. Filter feeding is the defining trait of modern whales. There are few ways in which this unique strategy could have evolved from tooth bearing, predatory ancestors, and our study firmly rules out one of them.

Elasmosaurs Elasmosauridae were a family of plesiosaurs that flourished during the Cretaceous period, about 145 million to 66 million years ago. They were fully adapted to an aquatic lifestyle, and had a distinctive body plan comprising a streamlined body, paddle like limbs and a very long neck with up to 75 individual vertebrae. Named Lagenanectes richterae, the newly identified elasmosaur was 26 feet 8 m long and inhabited a shallow sea around what is now Germany some 130 million years ago. Private fossil collectors recovered the perfectly preserved bones of this ancient marine reptile most of the skull, which had a meshwork of long fang like teeth vertebrae ribs and bones from the four flipper like limbs from an abandoned clay pit near Sarstedt in northern Germany in 1964. Despite being discovered nearly half a century ago, Dr. Sven Sachs of the Natural History Museum in Bielefeld, Germany, and colleagues were only recently invited to study the specimen by the Lower Saxony State Museum. It was an honor to be asked to research the mysterious Sarstedt skeleton, Dr. Sachs said. The jaws of Lagenanectes richterae had some especially unusual features, said co author Dr. Jahn Hornung, a paleontologist based in Hamburg, Germany. Its broad chin was expanded into a massive jutting crest, and its lower teeth stuck out sideways. These probably served to trap small fish and squid that were then swallowed whole. Internal channels in the upper jaws of Lagenanectes richterae might have housed nerves linked to pressure receptors or electroreceptors on the outside of the snout that would have helped the reptile to locate its prey. The bones also showed evidence of chronic bacterial infection suggesting that the animal had suffered from a long term disease that perhaps eventually claimed its life. The most important aspect of this marine reptile is that it is amongst the oldest of its kind, said co author Dr. Benjamin Kear, from the Museum of Evolution at Uppsala University in Sweden. It is one of the earliest elasmosaurs, an extremely successful group of globally distributed plesiosaurs that seem to have had their evolutionary origins in the seas that once inundated Western Europe.

Inermorostrum xenops fed primarily on fish, squid, and other soft bodied invertebrates from the seafloor, similar to the feeding behavior of a walrus, said Professor Robert Boessenecker, from the University of California Museum of Paleontology and College of Charleston. Furthermore, a series of deep channels and holes for arteries on the snout indicate the presence of extensive soft tissues, likely enlarged lips, and also perhaps even whiskers. Professor Boessenecker and his colleagues from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, the Canadian Museum of Nature and the New York Institute of Technology also studied the evolution of snout length in cetaceans. They found that during the Oligocene 25 35 million years ago and early Miocene epochs 20 25 million years ago, the echolocating whales rapidly evolved extremely short snouts and extremely long snouts, representing an adaptive radiation in feeding behavior and specializations. They also found that short snouts and long snouts have both evolved numerous times on different parts of the evolutionary tree  and that modern dolphins like the bottlenose dolphin, which have a snout twice as long as it is wide, represent the optimum length as it permits both fish catching and suction feeding. The identification of\u00a0Inermorostrum xenops opens up new questions about the evolution of early whales, said Dr. Danielle Fraser, a paleontologist at the Canadian Museum of Nature. The discovery of a suction feeding whale this early in their evolution is forcing us to revise what we know about how quickly new forms appeared, and what may have been driving early whale evolution. Increased ocean productivity may have been one important factor, she said. The research is published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

The newly discovered titanosaur is called Shingopana songwensis and lived between 100 and 70 million years ago Cretaceous period. A partial skeleton of the prehistoric creature was first excavated in 2002 and represents the first significant discovery by the Rukwa Rift Basin Project, an international collaborative effort led by Ohio University\u00a0paleontologists. Over the next few years of excavation, additional portions of the skeleton, including neck vertebrae, ribs, a humerus, and part of the lower jaw, were recovered. There are a couple of key anatomical features only present in Shingopana songwensis and several South American titanosaurs but that are absent in other African titanosaurs, said team member Dr. Eric Gorscak, a postdoctoral researcher at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Shingopana songwensis had siblings in South America, whereas the other African titanosaurs were only distant cousins. Detailed comparison of the new titanosaur with other known sauropod dinosaurs suggests that the species found in southern Africa are certainly more diverse than previously thought. Dr. Gorscak and colleagues conducted phylogenetic analyses in order to understand the evolutionary relationships of these and other known titanosaurs. What they discovered is that Shingopana songwensis was more closely related to South American titanosaurs than to any of the other species currently known from Africa or elsewhere. This discovery suggests that the fauna of northern and southern Africa were different in the Cretaceous period, said Dr. Judy Skog, program director in NSFs Division of Earth Sciences. At that time, Southern African dinosaurs were more closely related to those in South America, and were more widespread than we knew. During the Cretaceous period, Shingopana songwensis roamed the landscape alongside Rukwatitan bisepultus, another species of titanosaur the same team described in 2014. The research on the new species appears today in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.  Eric Gorscak et al.

Paleontologists estimate that more than three quarters of all species on Earth, including all non avian dinosaurs, disappeared about 65 million years ago, at the Cretaceous Paleogene boundary, an event known as the K Pg extinction. Evidence shows that the mass extinction occurred at the same time that a 10 km diameter asteroid, dubbed Chicxulub, hit our planet in what is now the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The collision would have triggered earthquakes, tsunamis, and even volcanic eruptions. Researchers also calculate that the force of the impact would have launched vaporized rock high above Earths surface, where it would have condensed into small particles known as spherules. As the spherules fell back to Earth, they would have been heated by friction to temperatures high enough to spark global fires and broil Earths surface. A thin layer of spherules can be found worldwide in the geologic record. The extinction of many of the large animals on land could have been caused by the immediate aftermath of the impact, but animals that lived in the oceans or those that could burrow underground or slip underwater temporarily could have survived, said lead author Dr. Charles Bardeen, of the National Center for Atmospheric Research NCAR. Our study picks up the story after the initial effects  after the earthquakes and the tsunamis and the broiling. We wanted to look at the long term consequences of the amount of soot we think was created and what those consequences might have meant for the animals that were left. Dr. Bardeen and co authors used the NCAR based Community Earth System Model CESM to simulate the effect of the soot on global climate going forward. The team used the most recent estimates of the amount of fine soot found in the layer of rock left after the Chicxulub impact 15,000 million tons, as well as larger and smaller amounts, to quantify the climates sensitivity to more or less extensive fires. In the simulations, soot heated by the Sun was lofted higher and higher into the atmosphere, eventually forming a global barrier that blocked the vast majority of sunlight from reaching Earths surface. At first it would have been about as dark as a moonlit night, said co author Owen Brian Toon, a professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences and a research associate in the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder. While the skies would have gradually brightened, photosynthesis would have been impossible for up to two years, according to the simulations. Because many of the plants on land would have already been incinerated in the fires, the darkness would likely have had its greatest impact on phytoplankton, which underpin the ocean food chain. The loss of these tiny organisms would have had a ripple effect through the ocean, eventually devastating many species of marine life. The researchers also found that photosynthesis would have been temporarily blocked even at much lower levels of soot. For example, in a simulation using only 5,000 million tons of soot  about a third of the best estimate from measurements  photosynthesis would still have been impossible for an entire year. In the simulations, the loss of sunlight caused a steep decline in average temperatures at Earths surface, with a drop of 50 degrees Fahrenheit 28 degrees Celsius over land and 20 degrees Fahrenheit 11 degrees Celsius over the oceans. These freezing temperatures persisted at middle latitudes for 3 4 years. While Earths surface cooled in the study scenarios, the atmosphere higher up in the stratosphere actually became much warmer as the soot absorbed light from the Sun. The warmer temperatures caused ozone destruction and allowed for large quantities of water vapor to be stored in the upper atmosphere. The water vapor then chemically reacted in the stratosphere to produce hydrogen compounds that led to further ozone destruction. The resulting ozone loss would have allowed damaging doses of UV light to reach Earths surface after the soot cleared. The large reservoir of water in the upper atmosphere formed in the simulations also caused the layer of sunlight blocking soot to be removed abruptly after lingering for years, the authors said. As the soot began to settle out of the stratosphere, the air began to cool. This cooling, in turn, caused water vapor to condense into ice particles, which washed even more soot out of the atmosphere. As a result of this feedback loop  cooling causing precipitation that caused more cooling  the thinning soot layer disappeared in just a few months. The research appears this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Named Anatoliadelphys maasae, the new species is an unusual, cat sized carnivorous metatherian marsupials and their relatives. It lived in what is now Turkey during the middle Eocene epoch, about 43 million years ago. With an estimated body mass of 3 4 kg, about the size of a domestic cat, the prehistoric animal is one of the largest metatherians known from the northern hemisphere, together with two North American species the extant Virginia opossum 2.4 kg and the extinct Didelphodon vorax 2 6 kg. A three dimensionally preserved skull and a near complete skeleton of Anatoliadelphys maasae were discovered and collected in 2002 from the Uzun\u00e7ar\u015f\u0131dere Formation in central Turkey. They were analyzed by Dr. Murat Maga from the University of Washington and Dr. Robin Beck from the Universities of Salford and New South Wales. The analysis indicates that Anatoliadelphys maasae was agile and was able to climb and grasp, perhaps similarly to the modern day spotted quoll. Its strong jaws and large, broad premolars suggest that it was carnivorous and capable of crushing hard objects durophagy, which would make it the first known Cenozoic carnivorous metatherian from the northern hemisphere. Anatoliadelphys maasae shows that northern hemisphere metatherians were far more diverse than we previously thought  they werent all small insect eaters, Dr. Beck said. The northern hemisphere had numerous cat sized carnivorous eutherians during the Cenozoic era, which may have competed with Anatoliadelphys maasae, the paleontologists explained. However, carnivorous eutherians have yet to be found in the Uzun\u00e7ar\u015f\u0131dere Formation, which was likely an island during this era. This suggests that Anatoliadelphys maasae may have evolved in the absence of eutherian competitors, supporting the hypothesis that eutherians could outcompete metatherians where the two existed side by side.

The study, published this week in the journal Nature, involved an international team of researchers from the Australian National University, the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry and the University of Bremen. The team discovered ancient sedimentary rocks in central Australia that related directly to the period just after the melting of the snowball Earth. In these rocks we discovered striking signals of molecular fossils. We immediately knew that we had made a ground breaking discovery that snowball Earth was directly involved in the evolution of large and complex life, said co author Dr. Amber Jarrett, of the Australian National University. We crushed these rocks to powder and extracted molecules of ancient organisms from them, added lead author Dr. Jochen Brocks, also from the Australian National University. These molecules tell us that it really became interesting 650 million years ago. It was a revolution of ecosystems, it was the Rise of Algae. The rise of algae triggered one of the most profound ecological revolutions in Earths history, without which humans and other animals would not exist. Before all of this happened, there was a dramatic event 50 million years earlier called snowball Earth, he said. The Earth was frozen over for 50 million years. Huge glaciers ground entire mountain ranges to powder that released nutrients, and when the snow melted during an extreme global heating event rivers washed torrents of nutrients into the ocean. The extremely high levels of nutrients in the ocean, and cooling of global temperatures to more hospitable levels, created the perfect conditions for the rapid spread of algae, Dr. Brocks said. It was the transition from oceans being dominated by bacteria to a world inhabited by more complex life. These large and nutritious organisms at the base of the food web provided the burst of energy required for the evolution of complex ecosystems, where increasingly large and complex animals, including humans, could thrive on Earth. "}, {"title": " Cretaceous Flowers Found Preserved in Burmese Amber", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Aug 17, 2017", "doc": "In a paper published recently in the journal Palaeodiversity, U.S. paleontologists described a new species of angiosperm flower, Tropidogyne pentaptera, found in seven pieces of 99 million year old mid Cretaceous amber excavated from a mine in Myanmar also known as Burma. The amber fossils came from the Noije Bum 2001 Summit Site mine excavated in the Hukawng Valley and located southwest of Maingkhwan in Kachin State. The flowers range from 3.4 to 5 mm in diameter, necessitating study under a microscope. The amber preserved the floral parts so well that they look like they were just picked from the garden, said Professor George Poinar Jr., of Oregon State University. Dinosaurs may have knocked the branches that dropped the flowers into resin deposits on the bark of an araucaria tree, which is thought to have produced the resin that fossilized into the amber. Araucaria trees are related to kauri pines found today in New Zealand and Australia, and kauri pines produce a special resin that resists weathering. The new study builds on earlier research also involving Burmese amber in which the same team described another species in the same genus, Tropidogyne pikei. Tropidogyne pentaptera has spreading, veiny sepals, a nectar disc, and a ribbed inferior ovary like T. pikei, Professor Poinar noted. But its different in that its bicarpellate, with two elongated and slender styles, and the ribs of its inferior ovary dont have darkly pigmented terminal glands like T. pikei. Both Tropidogyne pentaptera and T. pikei belong to the extant family Cunoniaceae, a widespread Southern Hemisphere family of 27 genera and about 330 species of woody plants. Tropidogyne pentaptera was probably a rainforest tree, Professor Poinar said. In their general shape and venation pattern, the fossil flowers closely resemble those of the genus Ceratopetalum that occur in Australia and Papua New Guinea, he added. One extant species is Ceratopetalum gummiferum, which is known as the New South Wales Christmas bush because its five sepals turn bright reddish pink close to Christmas. Another extant species in Australia is the coach wood tree Ceratopetalum apetalum, which like the new species has no petals, only sepals. The towering coach wood tree grows to heights of greater than 120 feet, can live for centuries and produces lumber for flooring, furniture and cabinetwork. So what explains the relationship between a mid Cretaceous Tropidogyne from Myanmar and an extant Ceratopetalum from Australia, more than 4,000 miles and an ocean away to the southeast? Thats easy, if you consider the geological history of the regions, Professor Poinar said. Probably the amber site in Myanmar was part of Greater India that separated from the southern hemisphere, the supercontinent Gondwana, and drifted to southern Asia. Malaysia, including Burma, was formed during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras by subduction of terranes that successfully separated and then moved northward by continental drift.

Chilesaurus diegosuarezi was first described in 2015 by Dr. Fernando Novas of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and co authors. The prehistoric creature lived in what is now Chile during the Upper Jurassic epoch and possessed a bizarre suite of anatomical features. For example, its head resembles that of a carnivore, but it has flat teeth for grinding up plant matter. Professor Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum London and Matthew Baron of the University of Cambridge have now analyzed more than 450 anatomical characteristics of early dinosaurs and correctly placed Chilesaurus diegosuarezi in the dinosaur family tree. Chilesaurus diegosuarezi almost looks like it was stitched together from different animals, which is why it baffled everybody, Baron said. Earlier research suggested that this dinosaur belonging to Tetanurae, a taxonomically and ecologically diverse group of theropod dinosaurs, but the new study suggests that it was probably a very early member of a completely different group Ornithischia, the bird hipped group of dinosaurs that includes Stegosaurus, Triceratops and Iguanodon. Chilesaurus diegosuarezi is one of the most puzzling and intriguing dinosaurs ever discovered, Professor Barrett said. Its weird mix of features places it in a key position in dinosaur evolution and helps to show how some of the really big splits between the major groups might have come about. The bird hipped dinosaurs have several common physical traits the two most notable of these are an inverted, bird like hip structure and a beak like structure for eating, the paleontologists explained. The inverted hips allowed for bigger, more complex digestive systems, which in turn allowed larger plant eaters to evolve. While Chilesaurus diegosuarezi has a bird like hip structure, and has flat teeth for grinding up plants, it does not possess the distinctive beak of many other bird hipped dinosaurs, which is what makes it such an important find. Before this, there were no transitional specimens  we didnt know what order these characteristics evolved in, Baron said. This shows that in bird hipped dinosaurs, the gut evolved first, and the jaws evolved later  it fills the gap quite nicely. There was a split in the dinosaur family tree, and the two branches took different evolutionary directions, he added. This seems to have happened because of change in diet for Chilesaurus diegosuarezi. It seems it became more advantageous for some of the meat eating dinosaurs to start eating plants, possibly even out of necessity. The research appears today in the journal Biology Letters.

Lemmysuchus obtusidens Lemmys blunt toothed crocodile lived around 164 million years ago during the Middle Jurassic epoch. The prehistoric beast was a sea going member of an extinct group called teleosaurs, common during the Jurassic but only distantly related to modern crocodiles. It inhabited shallow sea waters around the coast of land that would become modern day Europe. The body of Lemmysuchus obtusidens was almost 20 feet 6 m long, with a skull measuring more than 3 feet 1 m. Its broad snout and large blunt teeth evolved for crushing shelled prey such as turtles  in contrast to its close relatives that had longer snouts and thinner teeth for catching fish. With a meter long skull and a total length of 5.8 m, it would have been one of the biggest coastal predators of its time, said lead author Dr. Michela Johnson, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh. The specimen was dug up by fossil collectors in the early 20th century from a clay pit quarry near Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, UK. Dr. Johnson and co authors found that the fossil had been classified incorrectly with other sea crocodiles from the quarries at Peterborough, and it needed a new scientific name. It can be difficult to identify new species as we are normally working with incomplete fossil skeletons, Dr. Johnson said. Following careful anatomical comparison, and by referring to the main specimen held at the Natural History Museum, London, we could see that most of the previous finds were actually from relatives of this croc rather than the species itself, and we were able to assign a new name.

At about 122 feet 37 m long and weighing about 69 tons in life, Patagotitan mayorum is the largest animal ever to walk the planet and one of the most complete titanosaurs. Patagotitan mayorum roamed the Earth about 101.6 million years ago during the Albian, the uppermost subdivision of the Early Cretaceous epoch. The fossil remains of at least six individuals were discovered in 2012 13 at a single site in the Province of Chubut, Patagonia, Argentina. When first news of the finding came out in 2013, the dig was still active, said Dr. Jos\u00e9 Luis Carballido, of the Museo Egidio Feruglio MEF. We had seen many bones on the field that showed certain features that indicated this was a new species and, apparently, the largest one found until then. From that moment, numerous field trips were carried out to unearth the fossils, which were later prepared in MEF labs. It was only then that we could start studying the material to determine exact features that would allow us to identify this new species. We found three different levels with bones in the same excavation, all of them belonging to one same species, Dr. Carballido said. The environment in which those bones were deposited and buried was a floodplain, where successive river overflows had covered the dead animals remains. These overflows energy wasnt strong enough as to move the bones. In other words, these dinosaurs were there, died there and had gone to that place in at least three different occasions. Patagotitan mayorum averaged 122 feet long and was nearly 20 feet 6 m high at the shoulder. The dinosaur weighed 69 tons, which is 10 tons over 15 more than the mass estimate obtained for the previous record holder, the giant titanosaur Dreadnoughtus schrani. Estimating the body weight of an extinct animal is a challenging task, noted MEF researcher Dr. Diego Pol. We only have left the bones and from these remains we have to infer the body weight through the use of indirect methods. We compared the remains of Patagotitan mayorum with all the species that could be related to it, not only in terms of size, but also those that lived at the same time or had certain features in common, Dr. Carballido said. Among them we included species such as Argentinosaurus, Puertasaurus and Futalognkosaurus, which are other giant species of dinosaurs from Argentina. We performed a detailed comparison against all these species and found some striking differences, despite the fact that some of them were very incomplete, like for example Puertasaurus. The teams analysis also revealed the presence of a previously unrecognized diverse lineage of Patagonian titanosaurs. This lineage is a sister to Rinconsauria, a lineage that includes some of the smallest titanosaurs known so far. It includes most of the giant species of titanosaurs and represents the major increase in body mass in the history of Titanosauria. The phylogenetic study we performed indicates that most of the giant titanosaurs known in Patagonia belong to a single lineage, Dr. Pol said. This means that the evolution of extreme gigantism within titanosaurs happened but only once, and not in multiple separate events. We can see some other cases of size increase relative to the ancestral size of titanosaurs, but none of them was as dramatic as the one seen in this group and exemplified by Patagotitan mayorum. This means that apparently almost all the truly giant dinosaurs were related to each other and form the group known as Lognkosauria. This group of giants probably emerged by the end of the Lower Cretaceous Patagotitan mayorum would be the oldest and had survived until the middle Upper Cretaceous between 100 and 85 million years ago.

Named Maiopatagium furculiferum and Vilevolodon diplomylos, these prehistoric animals are the earliest known gliders in the long history of early mammals. Maiopatagium furculiferum and Vilevolodon diplomylos are stem mammaliaforms, extinct relatives of living mammals, and belong to Haramiyida, an entirely extinct branch on the mammalian evolutionary tree. The two fossils were discovered in the Tiaojishan Formation northeast of Beijing, China. They show the exquisitely fossilized, wing like skin membranes between their front and back limbs. They also show many skeletal features in their shoulder joints and forelimbs that gave the ancient animals the agility to be capable gliders. The fossils are described in two papers published this month in the journal Nature by Professor Zhe Xi Luo of the University of Chicago and co authors. These Jurassic mammals are truly the first in glide. In a way, they got the first wings among all mammals, Professor Luo said. With every new mammal fossil from the Age of Dinosaurs, we continue to be surprised by how diverse mammalian forerunners were in both feeding and locomotor adaptations. The groundwork for mammals successful diversification today appears to have been laid long ago. Maiopatagium furculiferum and Vilevolodon diplomylos share similar ecology with modern gliding mammals, with some significant differences. Today, the hallmark of most gliders is their herbivorous diet that typically consists of seeds, fruits and other soft parts of flowering plants. But Maiopatagium furculiferum and Vilevolodon diplomylos lived in a Jurassic world where the plant life was dominated by ferns and gymnosperms like cycads, ginkgoes and conifers. This distinct diet and lifestyle evolved again some 100 million years later among modern mammals, in examples of convergent evolution and ecology. Its amazing that the aerial adaptations occurred so early in the history of mammals, said co author David Grossnickle, a graduate student at the University of Chicago. Not only did these fossils show exquisite fossilization of gliding membranes, their limb, hand and foot proportion also suggests a new gliding locomotion and behavior.  Qing Jin Meng et al.

In 2014, University of Alberta paleontology student Aaron J. van der Reest discovered an intact troodontid pelvis in Dinosaur Provincial Park, leading him to take a closer look at previously collected troodontid cranial bones from southern Alberta. Thats when everything fell together and we were able to confirm that there were in fact two different species  named Latenivenatrix mcmasterae and Stenonychosaurus inequalis  in the Dinosaur Park Formation, instead of just one, van der Reest said. Up until then, the vast majority of troodontid specimens found in North America had been classified as Troodon formosus. Troodon formosus has been found from Mexico all the way to Alaska, spanning a 15 million year period  a fantastic and unlikely feat, van der Reest said. The hips we found could ultimately open the door for dozens of new species to be discovered. According to van der Reest and his co author, University of Alberta Professor Philip Currie, Latenivenatrix mcmasterae and Stenonychosaurus inequalis roamed the Earth around 72 million years ago during the Campanian, the fifth of six ages of the Upper Cretaceous epoch. Latenivenatrix mcmasterae is the largest of the troodontids ever found anywhere in the world, standing nearly 6.5 feet 2 m at the head and close to 11.5 feet 3.5 m long, van der Reest said. Its about 50 larger than any other troodontids previously known, making it one of the largest deinonychosaurs raptor like dinosaurs we currently recognize. For van der Reest, naming a new dinosaur species has been an especially powerful experience. He has named his discovery Latenivenatrix mcmasterae in honor of his late mother, Lynne McMaster van der Reest, whose encouragement was essential for his pursuit of paleontology. Having brought my first find full circle, from discovery to publishing my research three years later, has been really incredible. I cant think of a better way to honor her memory, he said.

Named Corythoraptor jacobsi, the new discovered dinosaur belongs to Oviraptoridae, a group of bird like, herbivorous and omnivorous dinosaurs. The ancient creature is thought to have lived approximately 72 million years ago Late Cretaceous epoch. Its fossilized skeleton, including a skull and a lower jaw, was found in the Nanxiong Formation beds near Ganzhou City, Jiangxi Province. The specimen was analyzed by Prof. L\u00fc Junchang, a paleontologist with the Institute of Geology in Beijing, and his colleagues from China, Slovak Republic, South Korea, and Japan. The histological study revealed that the specimen was probably at least eight years old but still not a fully grown individual, the paleontologists said. According to the team, Corythoraptor jacobsi had a highly developed cassowary like skull crest casque and a long neck, morphologically similar to those of modern flightless cassowary birds. The casque was likely covered by outer keratinous sheath. The shell like outer layer of the casque is approximately 2 3 mm thick in the cassowary and 2 mm thick in Corythoraptor jacobsi, the researchers said. They hypothesize that the skull crest of Corythoraptor jacobsi was a multifunction structure utilized in display, communication and probably expression of the fitness during mating seasons. The cassowary like crest in the skull is similar to the casque of cassowaries, which serves a sociosexual role and functions in visual and acoustic display. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the cassowary like crest of Corythoraptor jacobsi was probably utilized in a similar way, Prof. Junchang and co authors explained. The sharp claw and long neck of Corythoraptor jacobsi may also indicate that its living behavior is perhaps similar to the modern flightless cassowary. It seems more reasonable to assume that the cassowary like crest of\u00a0Corythoraptor jacobsi was more likely the multifunctional structure that conspicuously expressed fitness, and probably sex, of each individual of Corythoraptor jacobsi. The discovery of Corythoraptor jacobsi provides unprecedented evidence that oviraptorid dinosaurs were morphologically and taxonomically far more diverse in the Ganzhou area of China than in any other known region of the world, the paleontologists said. The discovery of Corythoraptor jacobsi is reported in the journal Scientific Reports.

The results appear today in the journal Current Biology. Borealopelta markmitchelli is a species of nodosaur, a type of ankylosaur. It roamed the Earth during the Cretaceous period, about 110 million years ago. Its spectacularly detailed mummy was found by accident in March 2011 by excavator operator Shawn Funk at the Suncor Millennium Mine in Alberta, Canada. The Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta, was notified and sent a group of paleontologists to take a look.

The fact that it was so well preserved was an even bigger surprise, said Dr. Donald Henderson, Curator of Dinosaurs at the Royal Tyrrell Museum.

The specimen is about 5.5 m 18 feet long and weighs 1,134 kg 2,500 lb, not far off its 1,360 kg 3,000 lb fighting weight estimated by the researchers. They think Borealopelta markmitchelli may have been swept away by a flooded river and carried out to sea, where it eventually sank. Over millions of years on the ocean floor, minerals took the place of its armor and skin. The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous, the scientists said. The specimen now represents the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. The fossil was analyzed by a team of experts from MIT, Newcastle University, the University of Bristol, and the Royal Tyrrell Museum.  To infer the dinosaurs pigmentation pattern, the paleontologists analyzed organic compounds in its horns and skin impressions. They found that the skin of Borealopelta markmitchelli exhibited countershading, a common form of camouflage in which an animals underside is lighter than its back. This suggests that the nodosaur faced predation stress from meat eating dinosaurs. We found a lot of sulfur bearing organic compounds, which we later could confirm was evidence for reddish brown coloration, said team member Dr. Jakob Vinther, from the University of Bristol. Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta markmitchellis size far exceeds that of counter shaded animals alive today. It suggests the dinosaur was under enough pressure from predators to select for concealment. The Cretaceous period was a really scary time to be around in, he added. Large theropod dinosaurs with excellent color vision would have made life stressful for many dinosaurs, both big and small. The team is now examining Borealopelta markmitchellis preserved gut contents to find out the nature of its last meal, and working to characterize the body armor in even greater detail.

Albertavenator curriei, as the paleontologists call the new dinosaur species, belongs to Troodontidae, a family of bird like theropod dinosaurs. It lived about 71 million years ago Cretaceous period in what is now Alberta, Canada. Its specific name, curriei, honors the renowned Canadian paleontologist Dr. Philip J. Currie. The bones of Albertavenator curriei were found in the badlands surrounding the Royal Tyrrell Museum, which Dr. Currie played a key role in establishing in the early 1980s. Scientists initially thought that the dinosaurs bones belonged to its close relative, Troodon inequalis, which lived around 5 million years earlier. Both bird like creatures walked on two legs, were covered in feathers, and were about the size of a person. New comparisons of bones forming the top of the head reveal that Albertavenator curriei had a distinctively shorter and more robust skull than Troodon. The delicate bones of these feathered dinosaurs are very rare, said Dr. David Evans, Temerty Chair and Senior Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology at the Royal Ontario Museum and lead author of a new paper in the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences describing the discovery. We were lucky to have a critical piece of the skull that allowed us to distinguish Albertavenator curriei as a new species. We hope to find a more complete skeleton of Albertavenator curriei in the future, as this would tell us so much more about this fascinating animal. It was only through our detailed anatomical and statistical comparisons of the skull bones that we were able to distinguish between Albertavenator curriei and Troodon, added co author Thomas Cullen, a Ph.D. student at the University of Toronto. This discovery really highlights the importance of finding and examining skeletal material from these rare dinosaurs, said co author Dr. Derek Larson, Assistant Curator of the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum.

Razanandrongobe sakalavae means giant lizard ancestor from Sakalava region lived during the Middle Jurassic epoch, 168 165 million years ago, in what is now Madagascar. The crocodile like beast is by far the oldest  and possibly the largest  representative of Notosuchia, a large group of terrestrial crocodylomorphs that lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous. Little is known about the origin and early evolution of Notosuchia, Dr. Dal Sasso and co authors said. Our research begins to fill the gap in a million year long ghost lineage. The team examined the cranial bones and teeth of Razanandrongobe sakalavae collected from the Middle Jurassic layers of the Sakaraha Formation, Mahajanga Basin, northwestern Madagascar. Paleontologists had previously identified the species as a member of Archosauria, a group of reptiles that first appeared in the Late Permian. A combination of anatomical features clearly identifies Razanandrongobe sakalavae as a Jurassic notosuchian, close to the South American baurusuchids and sebecids, that were highly specialized predators of terrestrial habits, different from present day crocodilians in having a deep skull and powerful erect limbs, Dr. Dal Sasso said. Like these and other gigantic crocs from the Cretaceous, Razanandrongobe sakalavae could outcompete even theropod dinosaurs, at the top of the food chain. The diet of Razanandrongobe sakalavae included hard tissue such as bone and tendon, according to the researchers. Razanandrongobe sakalavae represents one of the earliest events of exacerbated increase in body size along the evolutionary history of the group, they said. Its geographic position during the period when Madagascar was separating from other landmasses is strongly suggestive of an endemic lineage. At the same time, it represents a further signal that Notosuchia originated in southern Gondwana, said co author Dr. Simone Maganuco, also from the Natural History Museum of Milan. The teams findings are published in the journal PeerJ.

The team, led by Dr. Catalina Pimiento of the Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Science and the Paleontological Institute and Museum at the University of Zurich, analyzed fossilized remains of marine megafauna from Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs 5.3 million to around 9,700 years ago. We were able to show that around a third of marine megafauna disappeared about three to two million years ago, Dr. Pimiento said. Therefore, the marine megafaunal communities that humans inherited were already altered and functioning at a diminished diversity. The newly discovered extinction event affected marine mammals, which lost 55 of their diversity. As many as 43 of sea turtle species were lost, along with 35 of sea birds and 9 of sharks, the researchers said. On the other hand, around a quarter of animal species, including the polar bear Ursus, the storm petrel Oceanodroma or the penguin Megadyptes, had not existed during the Pliocene. Overall, however, earlier levels of diversity could not be reached again. In order to determine the consequences of this extinction, Dr. Pimiento and co authors concentrated on shallow coastal shelf zones, analyzing the effects that the loss of entire functional entities had on coastal ecosystems. Functional entities are groups of animals not necessarily related, but that share similar characteristics in terms of the function they play on ecosystems. The finding seven functional entities were lost in coastal waters during the Pliocene, they said. Even though the loss of seven functional entities, and one third of the species is relatively modest, this led to an important erosion of functional diversity 17 of the total diversity of ecological functions in the ecosystem disappeared and 21 changed. Previously common predators vanished, while new competitors emerged and marine animals were forced to adjust. In addition, we found that at the time of the extinction, coastal habitats were significantly reduced due to violent sea levels fluctuations. The team proposes that the sudden loss of the productive coastal habitats, together with oceanographic factors such as altered sea currents, greatly contributed to these extinctions. Our models demonstrate that warm blooded animals in particular were more likely to become extinct. For example, species of sea cows and baleen whales, as well as the giant shark Carcharocles megalodon disappeared, Dr. Pimiento said. This study shows that marine megafauna were far more vulnerable to global environmental changes in the recent geological past than had previously been assumed. The research was published online this week in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution.

After carefully comparing megapode fossils from Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia, the paleontologists have concluded that the remains belong to five different extinct species Garrdimalga mcnamarai new species, Progura gallinacea and P. campestris new species, Latagallina naracoortensis and L. olsoni new species. All five birds were chunky relatives of extant malleefowl Leipoa ocellata and brush turkeys Alectura lathami, but Progura gallinacea soars above the others. The earliest described extinct megapode, Progura gallinacea had an estimated mass of 7.7 kg. Progura campestris, Latagallina naracoortensis, Garrdimalga mcnamarai and Latagallina olsoni had average masses of 6.2 kg, 5.2 kg, 5.2 kg and 2.9 kg, respectively. Progura gallinacea had long, slender legs. Latagallina naracoortensis and L. olsoni had shorter legs and broad bodies. These giant megapodes lived during the Pleistocene, between 5 million and 11,000 years ago, alongside Australias giant extinct marsupials such as diprotodons, marsupial lions and short faced kangaroos. It seems that none of these birds built mounds like their living Australian cousins because they lacked the large feet and specialized claws seen in mound builders. Its more likely that they buried their eggs in warm sand or soil, like some living megapodes in Indonesia and the Pacific. Unlike many large extinct birds, such as dodos, these megapodes were not flightless. While big and bulky, their long, strong wing bones show they could all fly, and probably roosted in trees. These discoveries are quite remarkable because they tell us that more than half of Australias megapodes went extinct during the Pleistocene, and we didnt even realize it until now, said Elen Shute, a PhD candidate at Flinders University and lead author of a paper in the journal Royal Society Open Science. Given several of the largest birds to have lived in Australia in recent times have escaped detection in the fossil record until now, our research shows how little we know of Australias immediate pre human avifauna, said co author Dr. Trevor Worthy, an associate professor at Flinders University. Probably many smaller extinct species also await discovery by paleontologists.

Gondwanagaricites magnificus was about 2 inches 5 cm tall and grew 115 million years ago Early Cretaceous epoch in what is now northeast Brazil. The specimen was found in the limestone of the Crato Formation in Brazils Araripe Basin. The find is described in new research published this week in the journal PLoS ONE, led by paleontologist Dr. Sam Heads of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Electron microscopy revealed that Gondwanagaricites magnificus had gills under its cap, rather than pores or teeth, structures that release spores and that can aid in identifying species. Dr. Heads and his colleagues from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and Savannah State University place the mushroom in the fungal order Agaricales. Gondwanagaricites magnificus represents the oldest fossil record of a gilled mushroom and is the only fossil mushroom known from a mineralized replacement, they explained. The unique specimen extends the geological range of gilled mushrooms back by approximately 14 21 million years and confirms their presence in Gondwana during the Early Cretaceous. According to the authors, the mushroom somehow made its way into a saline lagoon, sank through the stratified layers of salty water and was covered in layer upon layer of fine sediments. In time  lots of it  the mushroom was mineralized, its tissues replaced by pyrite fools gold, which later transformed into the mineral goethite. Before this discovery, the oldest fossil mushrooms found had been preserved in amber, said co author Dr. Andrew Miller, also from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. The next oldest mushroom fossils, found in amber in Southeast Asia, date to about 99 million years ago. They were enveloped by a sticky tree resin and preserved as the resin fossilized, forming amber, Dr. Heads added. This is a much more likely scenario for the preservation of a mushroom, since resin falling from a tree directly onto the forest floor could readily preserve specimens. This certainly seems to have been the case, given the mushroom fossil record to date.

The study challenges a long held assumption among paleontologists that Palaeoloxodon antiquus was most closely related to the Asian elephant Elephas maximus. The findings also add to the evidence that todays African elephants are two separate species, not one, as was once assumed. Palaeoloxodon antiquus males stood up to 4 m tall and weighed as much as 13 tons, more than twice the weight of todays largest elephants. Understanding their genetic heritage is key to keeping todays elephants from going extinct, said study co author Dr. Alfred Roca, from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. For the study, Dr. Roca and his colleagues sequenced full mitochondrial genomes from four and partial nuclear genomes from two Palaeoloxodon antiquus fossils. These fossils were collected at two sites in Germany, Neumark Nord and Weimar Ehringsdorf, and date to interglacial periods 120,000 and 244,000 years ago, respectively. The sequences were analyzed to determine how straight tusked elephants are related to the three living elephant species and the extinct mammoth. Up until now, genetic research on bones that are hundreds of thousands of years old has almost exclusively relied on fossils collected in permafrost, said lead co author Dr. Matthias Meyer, a researcher from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. It is encouraging to see that recent advances in laboratory methods are now enabling us to recover very old DNA sequences also from warmer places, where DNA degrades at a much faster rate. The mitochondrial analysis revealed that a shared ancestor of Palaeoloxodon antiquus and the African forest elephant lived sometime between 1.5 million and 3.5 million years ago. Their closest shared ancestor with the African savanna elephant lived between 3.9 and 7 million years ago. According to the team, the nuclear DNA told the same story. From the study of bone morphology, people thought Palaeoloxodon antiquus was closer to the Asian elephant. But from the molecular data, we found they are much closer to the African forest elephant, said co author Dr. Yasuko Ishida, from the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Palaeoloxodon antiquus is a sister to the African forest elephant it is not a sister to the Asian elephant or the African savanna elephant, Dr. Roca said. Paleogenomics has already revolutionized our view of human evolution, and now the same is happening for other mammalian groups, said lead co author Prof. Michael Hofreiter, from the University of Potsdam.

Megalosaurus bucklandii was a carnivorous dinosaur that lived in the Middle Jurassic, around 167 million years ago. It would have been about 30 feet 9 m long and weighed about 1,400 kg. The world famous Megalosaurus jawbone, collected over 200 years ago in a quarry near the village of Stonesfield in Oxfordshire, UK, is housed at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Using the X Ray Computed Tomography XCT and specialist 3D analysis software, Professor Mark Williams of the University of Warwick and co authors took more than 3,000 X ray images of the jawbone, creating a digital 3D image of the specimen. In an unprecedented level of analysis, they were able to see inside the jawbone for the first time, tracing the roots of teeth and the extent of different repairs. Some damage occurred to the specimen when it was removed from the rock, possibly shortly after it was discovered. Records at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History suggest that some restoration work may have been undertaken by a museum assistant between 1927 and 1931, while repairing the specimen for display. The XCT scans have revealed previously unseen teeth that were growing deep within the jaw before the animal died  including the remains of old, worn teeth and also tiny newly growing teeth. The scans also show the true extent of repairs on the fossil for the first time, revealing that there may have been at least two phases of repair, using different types of plaster. Being able to use state of the art technology normally reserved for aerospace and automotive engineering to scan such a rare and iconic natural history specimen was a fantastic opportunity, Prof. Williams said. When I was growing up I was fascinated with dinosaurs and clearly remember seeing pictures of the Megalosaurus jaw in books that I read.

Duck billed dinosaurs, or hadrosaurids, are members of the family Hadrosauridae. They were common plant eaters in the Upper Cretaceous epoch 100.5 million to 66 million years ago of what are now Asia, Europe and North America. Complete hadrosaur skeletons have been unearthed on these continents, but it is rare for a complete skeleton of a terrestrial dinosaur to be discovered in a marine stratum. In 1936, a complete skeleton of the hadrosaur Nipponosaurus sachalinensis was found in marine sediments in Sakhalin by Professor Takumi Nagao of Hokkaido Imperial University predecessor of Hokkaido University. It had been the only such fossilized dinosaur from a marine stratum that was assigned a name. The latest discovery, nicknamed Mukawaryu Mukawa dragon, represents the third such discovery in the world.

Dr. Stephen Chester and co authors analyzed a partial skeleton of Torrejonia wilsoni, a small primate that lived in what is now western North America around 62 million years ago early Paleocene. The skeleton was found in the Nacimiento Formation, San Juan Basin, New Mexico, by Dr. Thomas Williamson, curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History  Science, and his twin sons, Taylor and Ryan. It consists of over 20 separate bones, including parts of the cranium, jaws, teeth, and portions of the upper and lower limbs. The study shows that Torrejonia wilsoni  a member of an extinct group of primates called plesiadapiforms  had skeletal features adapted to living in trees, such as flexible joints for climbing and clinging to branches. Previously, paleontologists had proposed that plesiadapiforms were terrestrial, based on details from cranial and dental fossils consistent with animals that nose about on the ground for insects. This is the oldest partial skeleton of a plesiadapiform, and it shows that they undoubtedly lived in trees, said Dr. Chester, lead author of the paper reporting the results in the journal Royal Society Open Science. We now have anatomical evidence from the shoulder, elbow, hip, knee, and ankle joints that allows us to assess where these animals lived in a way that was impossible when we only had their teeth and jaws. The study supports the hypothesis that plesiadapiforms, which first appear in the fossil record shortly after the extinction of non avian dinosaurs, were the earliest primates. The team also contends that the new data provide additional evidence that all of the geologically oldest primates known from skeletal remains, encompassing several species, were arboreal. To find a skeleton like this, even though it appears a little scrappy, is an exciting discovery that brings a lot of new data to bear on the study of the origin and early evolution of primates, said senior author Prof. Eric Sargis, of Yale University. Palaechthonids, and other plesiadapiforms, had outward facing eyes and relied on smell more than living primates do today  details suggesting that plesiadapiforms are transitional between other mammals and modern primates.

Pliosaurs, also known as pliosauroids, were a type of short necked plesiosaur marine reptiles built for speed compared to their long necked cousins. These creatures were not dinosaurs, but distant cousins of modern turtles. They had four large flippers, large heads, extremely powerful jaws and enormous teeth, and hunted fish, cephalopod mollusks and other marine reptiles. They lived between 220 million years ago Triassic period and 70 million years ago Cretaceous period and were mostly found in the prehistoric seas that covered modern day Europe. The newly identified pliosaur, named Luskhan itilensis, lived during the Hauterivian age of the Early Cretaceous, approximately 130 million years ago. Its near complete skull was found almost 15 years ago by Ulyanovsk State University paleontologist Dr. Gleb Uspensky. The skull of Luskhan itilensis is about 5 feet 1.5 m in length, indicating a large animal. But its rostrum is extremely slender, resembling that of fish eating aquatic animals such as gharials or some species of river dolphins, said Dr. Valentin Fischer, a researcher with the University of Liege, Belgium. This is the most striking feature, as it suggests that pliosaurs colonized a much wider range of ecological niches than previously assumed. By analyzing two comprehensive datasets that describe the anatomy and ecomorphology of plesiosaurs with cutting edge techniques, we revealed that several evolutionary convergences took place during the evolution of plesiosaurs, notably after an important extinction event at the end of the Jurassic 145 million years ago, the researchers said. The new findings have also ramifications in the final extinction of pliosaurs, which took place several tens of million years before that of dinosaurs. Indeed, the results suggest that pliosaurs were able to bounce back after the latest Jurassic extinction, but then faced another extinction that would  this time  wipe them off the depths of ancient oceans, forever. The paper naming the new pliosaur was published today in the journal Current Biology.

There have been five mass extinction events in Earths history the end Ordovician extinction 450 440 million years ago, the Late Devonian extinction 375 360 million years ago, the end Permian extinction 252 million years ago, the end Triassic extinction 201.3 million years ago, and the end Cretaceous extinction 66 million years ago. The cause of the third and fourth was volcanic activity, while an asteroid impact led to the fifth. But triggers of the first and second mass extinctions had, until now, been unknown. Dr. David S. Jones of Amherst College, Professor Kunio Kaiho of Tohoku University and co authors looked into possible triggers of the end Ordovician extinction. The first mass extinction occurred at the end of the Ordovician. This age is between the divergence of the Ordovician and land invasion of vascular land plant and animals, the researchers explained. Animals in the Ordovician Silurian comprised marine animals like corals, trilobites, sea scorpion, orthoceras, brachiopods, graptolite, crinoid and jawless fish. Approximately 80 of species disappeared at the end of the Ordovician. The scientists collected sedimentary rock samples from two places  at Wangjiawan in south China and at the Monitor Range in Nevada, the United States  and analyzed them for mercury Hg. We found Hg enrichments coinciding with the Ordovician mass extinction in both areas, they said. This, we believe, is the product of large volcanic eruptions because Hg anomaly was also observed in other large igneous province volcanisms. Huge volcanic eruptions can produce sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere. Sulfate aerosols are strong, light reflecting aerosols, and cause global cooling. This rapid climate change is believed to be behind the loss of marine creatures. Details of the research were recently published in the journal Geology.

Sloths may well rank among the worlds most peculiar animals with their backs pointing downward, they hang in trees and move in slow motion from branch to branch with the aid of their sickle shaped claws. The extinct relatives of the sloths lived up to 10,000 years ago, for example the species Megatherium, said study lead author Professor Herv\u00e9 Bocherens, from the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany. They could reach the size of an elephant and were much too heavy to spend a significant amount of time in the trees. Instead, they lived on the ground, where they excavated large burrows. For many years, their dietary habits were an enigma the long claws on their hands and feet, in particular, gave rise to various speculations. Prof. Bocherens and co authors completed an isotopic analysis of collagen extracted from the sloth bones. Our measurements show that Megatherium lived on an exclusively vegetarian diet, Prof. Bocherens said. In carnivores, the proportion of proteins is significantly higher than in herbivores, which primarily eat food high in carbohydrates. These differences can be documented in the isotopes. In order to reinforce their results, the researchers compared their data with more than 200 bones from modern mammals, whose diet is known, as well as with fossil specimens from both carnivores and herbivores. Knowledge of the sloths feeding habits is important in order to understand their role in past ecosystems, Prof. Bocherens said. Moreover, the results can help us understand the interactions between Megatherium and the first human inhabitants of America  their habitats overlapped for several thousand years, before the giant sloths became extinct.

Beibeilong sinensis meaning baby dragon from China lived in what is now central eastern China during the Late Cretaceous, about 90 million years ago. It is described by the paleontologists based on dinosaur eggs and an associated embryo that were collected in Chinas Henan Province in 1993. The unprepared specimen was imported into the United States in mid 1993 by the Stone Company, which exposed the embryo and eggs during preparation. The specimen was featured in a cover article for National Geographic Magazine, and the embryo became popularly known as Baby Louie in recognition of Louis Psihoyos, the photographer for the article. This particular fossil was outside the country for over two decades and its return to China finally allowed us to properly study the specimen and name a new dinosaur species, said team member Prof. L\u00fc Junchang, a paleontologist at the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, and lead co author of a report published this week on Beibeilong sinensis in the journal Nature Communications. Along with the dinosaur embryo, the Baby Louie fossil contains between six and eight very large eggs. These eggs were given their own scientific name, Macroelongatoolithus xixiaensis meaning large elongate stone eggs. The eggs are up to 18 inches 45 cm long and weighed about 5 kg, making them some of the largest dinosaur eggs ever discovered, the researchers said. They were found in a ring shaped clutch, which was part of a nest that was about 6.5 10 feet 2 3 m in diameter and probably contained two dozen or more eggs. Lead co author Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary, and her colleagues Philip Currie and Kenneth Carpenter first began examining the Baby Louie fossil shortly after it arrived in the United States. They noticed the eggs and embryo skeleton looked similar to those of oviraptorosaurs, a group of meat eating dinosaurs that superficially look like cassowaries, but the eggs were far too large to have been laid by any known species of such dinosaurs at the time. Although the identity of the dinosaur embryo could not be determined due to its state of preservation, I had recognized that the large eggs in the nest belonged to an oviraptorosaur, based on various characteristics of the eggshell, Prof. Zelenitsky said. This meant that Baby Louies parents must have been truly gigantic, far larger than any known oviraptorosaur species at the time. Dinosaur embryos, because they are so small and are only present for a short time interval in the egg, are very rarely preserved as fossils. So discovering a fossilized dinosaur embryo is equivalent to winning the lottery, Prof. Zelenitsky noted. Baby Louie is the only embryo of a giant oviraptorosaur known in the world, she said. Ring shaped nests of eggs of smaller oviraptorosaur species have been found with the adults sitting in the centre of the nest, so an adult Beibeilong sinensis probably shared similar behaviors. With their parrot like skulls, feathers, and two legged stance, Beibeilong sinensis, weighing in at around 3 tons, are the largest dinosaurs likely to have sat on their nests to brood their clutch of eggs.

Our research also has major implications for the search for life on Mars, because the Red Planet has ancient hot spring deposits of a similar age to the Dresser Formation. Previously, the worlds oldest evidence for microbial life on land came from 2.7  2.9 billion year old deposits in South Africa containing organic matter rich ancient soils. Our exciting findings dont just extend back the record of life living in hot springs by 3 billion years, they indicate that life was inhabiting the land much earlier than previously thought, by up to about 580 million years, Djokic said. Djokic and her colleagues from the Universities of Auckland and New South Wales studied exceptionally well preserved deposits which are 3.48 billion years old in the Dresser Formation. They interpreted the deposits were formed on land, not in the ocean, by identifying the presence of geyserite. This mineral only forms around the edges of terrestrial hot spring pools and geysers. These are found actively forming today in New Zealand, Yellowstone National Park and Iceland to name a few, the researchers said. Previously, the oldest known geyserite had been identified from 400 million year old rocks. Within the Pilbara hotspring deposits, Djokic and co authors also discovered stromatolites  layered rock structures created by communities of ancient microbes. And there were other signs of early life in the deposits as well, including fossilized micro stromatolites, microbial palisade texture and well preserved bubbles that are inferred to have been trapped in a sticky substance to preserve the bubble shape. This shows a diverse variety of life existed in fresh water, on land, very early in Earths history. The Pilbara deposits are the same age as much of the crust of Mars, which makes hot spring deposits on the red planet an exciting target for our quest to find fossilized life there, said co author Professor Van Kranendonk, from the University of New South Wales, who was part of a research team that recently found some of the oldest evidence of life on Earth  3.7 billion year old fossil stromatolites in Greenland. The Pilbara provides us with a rich record of early life on Earth and is a key region for developing exploration strategies for Mars to try and answer one of the greatest enigmas in science and philosophy  did life arise more than once in the Universe?, said co author Professor Malcolm Walter, also from the University of New South Wales. Its a significant finding and one that re opens one of the biggest debates in science and that is, did life begin on land or in the sea? said co author Professor Kathy Campbell, an astrobiologist at the University of Auckland. This work is also highly relevant to Mars exploration. One of the key aims for NASAs 2020 Mars rover landing is the search for fossils in ancient more than 3 billion year old volcanic hot springs which we now know once existed on the Martian surface.

Orchids have their pollen in small sac like structures called pollinia, which are attached by supports to viscidia, or adhesive pads, that can stick to the various body parts of pollinating insects, including bees, beetles, flies and gnats. The entire pollination unit is known as a pollinarium. In this study, a small female fungus gnat was carrying the pollinaria of an extinct species of orchid  named Succinanthera baltica  when it became trapped in amber more than 45 million years ago. The pollinaria was attached to the base of the gnats hind leg. Amber preserves fossils so well that paleontologists could identify a droplet of congealed blood at the tip of the gnats leg, which had been broken off shortly before it was entombed in amber. Succinanthera baltica shows that orchids were well established in the Eocene epoch, and it is likely that lineages extended back into the Cretaceous period. Until such forms are discovered, the specimen provides a minimum date that can be used in future studies determining the evolutionary history and phylogeny of the orchids. How Succinanthera balticas pollen ended up attached to the fungus gnat and eventually entombed in amber from near the Baltic Sea in northern Europe is a matter of speculation. But orchids have evolved a surprisingly sophisticated system to draw in pollinating insects, which may have led to the gnats demise, said lead author Prof. George Poinar, Jr., of Oregon State University. We probably shouldnt say this about a plant, but orchids are very smart. Theyve developed ways to attract little flies and most of the rewards they offer are based on deception. Orchids use odor, color and the allure of nectar to draw in potential pollinating insects. They will emit a scent that suggests to hungry insects the promise of food, but after entering the flower they will learn that the promise of nourishment was false. Likewise, female gnats may pick up a mushroom like odor from many orchids, which attracts them as a place to lay their eggs because the decaying fungal tissue is a source of future nutrition. Alas, again it is a ruse. In frustration, they may go ahead and lay their eggs, dooming their offspring to a likely death from a lack of food. Finally, male insects are attracted by the ersatz scent of female flies and they actually will attempt to copulate with a part of the orchid they think is a potential mate. All three of these processes are based on deception and they all have the same end result, Prof. Poinar said. Though the deception works in different ways, the bottom line is that the orchid is able to draw in pollinating insects, which unwittingly gather pollen that becomes attached to their legs and other body parts, and then pass it on to the next orchid flowers that lure them in. Orchids are, indeed, pretty smart.  George Poinar, Jr.  Finn N. Rasmussen. 2017. Orchids from the past, with a new species in Baltic amber.

Named Galeamopus pabsti, the ancient beast belongs to the family Diplodocidae, one of the best known groups of sauropod dinosaurs. Galeamopus pabsti is similar to the famous dinosaur Diplodocus, but with more massive legs, and a particularly high and triangular neck close to the head, the researchers said. The fossilized remains of Galeamopus pabsti were found at the Howe Scott Quarry in the northern Bighorn Basin in Wyoming, the United States, by Swiss paleontologists in 1995, but its taken more than two decades for scientists to make sense of the bones. The species name pabsti honors the finder of the holotype specimen, Dr. Ben Pabst, who also created the skull reconstruction and led the repreparation of the specimen and its mount at the Sauriermuseum Aathal in Switzerland, the paleontologists said. The fossils were analyzed by Dr. Emanuel Tschopp from the University of Turin, Italy, and Dr. Oct\u00e1vio Mateus from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa and the Museum of Lourinh\u00e3, Portugal, who concluded Galeamopus pabsti lived at the Late Jurassic epoch. The type specimen died at a particular ontogenetic stage, where histology indicates that it reached sexual maturity, but neurocentral fusion in cervical and dorsal vertebrae has not yet been completed, the scientists said. The lack of fusion between vertebral centra and neural arches can thus not be taken as definitive evidence for a juvenile ontogenetic stage. They added furthermore, the specimen indicates that the number of vertebrae in the cervical column of diplodocids might have been more variable than previously assumed, and that the transition from cervical to dorsal elements was variable between genera. Although potentially surprising, the high diversity of sauropods in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation can be explained by a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors that allowed in particular a radiation of Diplodocidae. Research describing the new species is published online in the journal PeerJ.

Tokummia katalepsis  a large bivalved arthropod from the Marble Canyon fossil deposit, Burgess Shale, British Columbia, Canada  documents for the first time in detail the anatomy of early mandibulates. In spite of their colossal diversity today, the origin of mandibulates had largely remained a mystery, said Dr. C\u00e9dric Aria, a postdoctoral researcher at the Nanjing Institute for Geology and Palaeontology, China, and the lead author of a report published this week on Tokummia katalepsis in the journal Nature. Before now weve had only sparse hints at what the first arthropods with mandibles could have looked like, and no idea of what could have been the other key characteristics that triggered the unrivaled diversification of that group. Tokummia katalepsis lived in tropical seas during the Cambrian period, approximately 508 million years ago. This creature was a bottom dweller, as lobsters or mantis shrimps today, and was among the largest predators of its time, exceeding 3 inches 10 cm in length. This spectacular new predator, one of the largest and best preserved soft bodied arthropods from Marble Canyon, joins the ranks of many unusual marine creatures that lived during the Cambrian Explosion, a period of rapid evolutionary change starting about half a billion years ago when most major animal groups first emerged in the fossil record, said co author Dr. Jean Bernard Caron, senior curator of invertebrate paleontology at the Royal Ontario Museum and an associate professor at the University of Toronto. Analysis of several fossil specimens, following careful mechanical preparation and photographic work, showed that Tokummia katalepsis sported broad serrated mandibles as well as large but specialized anterior claws maxillipeds, which are typical features of modern mandibulates. The pincers of Tokummia katalepsis are large, yet also delicate and complex, reminding us of the shape of a can opener, with their couple of terminal teeth on one claw, and the other claw being curved towards them, Dr. Aria said. But we think they might have been too fragile to be handling shelly animals, and might have been better adapted to the capture of sizable soft prey items, perhaps hiding away in mud. Once torn apart by the spiny limb bases under the trunk, the mandibles would have served as a revolutionary tool to cut the flesh into small, easily digestible pieces.   The body of Tokummia katalepsis is made of more than 50 small segments covered by a broad two piece shell like structure called a bivalved carapace. Importantly, the animal bears subdivided limb bases with tiny projections called endites, which can be found in the larvae of certain crustaceans and are now thought to have been critical innovations for the evolution of the various legs of mandibulates, and even for the mandibles themselves. The many segmented body is otherwise reminiscent of myriapods, a group that includes centipedes, millipedes, and their relatives. Tokummia katalepsis also lacks the typical second antenna found in crustaceans, which illustrates a very surprising convergence with such terrestrial mandibulates, Dr. Aria said. The study also resolves the affinities of other emblematic fossils from Burgess Shale more than a hundred years after their discovery. Our study suggests that a number of other Burgess Shale fossils such as Branchiocaris, Canadaspis and Odaraia form with Tokummia katalepsis a group of crustacean like arthropods that we can now place at the base of all mandibulates, Dr. Aria said.

Sea scorpions are an extinct group of aquatic arthropods that are ancestors of modern spiders, lobsters, and ticks. The group is taxonomically diverse, with more than 20 families recognized and known from abundant fossil specimens. These creatures thrived in warm shallow waters, in both seas and lakes, around the world after the Cambrian explosion from the Ordovician to the Permian periods 460 to 248 million years ago. They were formidable predators and ranged in size from 6 inches 15 cm to 76 inches 2 m. They had thin, flexible bodies. Some species also had pinching claws. According to the new study, published in The American Naturalist, sea scorpions had another weapon at their disposal a serrated, slashing tail spine. Our study suggests that sea scorpions used their tails, weaponized by their serrated spiny tips, to dispatch their prey, Dr. Persons said. He and his colleague, Dr. Acorn, reached this conclusion after the discovery of a well preserved specimen of the Silurian sea scorpion Slimonia acuminata with a serrated spine tipped tail curved strongly to one side. The fossil was collected from the Patrick Burn Formation near Lesmahagow, Scotland. Unlike lobsters and shrimps, which can flip their broad tails up and down to help them swim, Slimonia acuminate tails were vertically inflexible but horizontally highly mobile, the researchers said. This means that these sea scorpions could slash their tails from side to side, meeting little hydraulic resistance and without propelling themselves away from an intended target, Dr. Persons said. Perhaps clutching their prey with their sharp front limbs eurypterids could kill pretty using a horizontal slashing motion. "}, {"title": " Teleocrater rhadinus: Early Dinosaur Relative Had Surprising Crocodile-Like Look", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 13, 2017", "doc": "Paleontologists have long wondered what the earliest dinosaur relatives looked like. Most assumed that they would look like dwarf dinosaurs and walk on two legs. The discovery of Teleocrater rhadinus, however, has overturned popular predictions. Teleocrater rhadinus lived during the Middle Triassic epoch more than 245 million years ago  pre dating the first true dinosaurs by 10 million years. This ancient creature appears in the fossil record just after a large group of reptiles, known as archosaurs, split into a bird branch leading to dinosaurs and eventually birds and a crocodile branch leading to alligators and crocodiles. Teleocrater rhadinus had a long neck and tail and was 7  10 feet 2.1 3 m in length. Rather than walking on two legs, it walked on four crocodilian like legs. The discovery of such an important new species is a once in a lifetime experience, said Dr. Sterling Nesbitt, a researcher at Virginia Tech and the lead author of a report published this week on Teleocrater rhadinus in the journal Nature. The discovery overturns widely held preconceptions about the morphology of early dinosaur relatives, with many paleontologists anticipating that such creatures would be smaller, bipedal and more dinosaur like. Teleocrater rhadinus fundamentally challenges our models of what the close relatives of dinosaurs would have looked like, said Richard Butler, a professor of paleobiology at the University of Birmingham, UK, and co author on the paper. The late paleontologist F. Rex Parrington first discovered Teleocrater rhadinus fossils in the Ruhuhu Basin of southern Tanzania in 1933. The late Alan J. Charig, then curator of fossil reptiles, amphibians and birds at the Natural History Museum of London, UK, was the first to study those original specimens in the 1950s. However, due to a lack of crucial bones, such as the ankle bones, Charig could not determine whether\u00a0Teleocrater rhadinus was more closely related to crocodylians or to dinosaurs. The new specimens, found in 2015, clear up those questions. The intact ankle bones and other parts of the skeleton helped Dr. Nesbitt, Prof. Butler and co authors determine that Teleocrater rhadinus is one of the oldest members of the archosaur tree and had a crocodilian look. Its astonishing to think that its taken more than 80 years for the true scientific importance of these fossils to be understood and published, Prof. Butler said. My colleague Alan Charig would have been thrilled to see one of his animals finally being named and occupying such an interesting position in the Tree of Life, said co author Prof. Paul Barrett, from the Natural History Museum of London. Our discovery shows the value of maintaining and re assessing historical collections many new discoveries, like this one, can be made by looking through museum collections with fresh eyes. The teams next steps are to return to Tanzania to find missing parts of Teleocrater rhadinus skeleton. Its so exciting to solve puzzles like Teleocrater rhadinus, where we can finally tease apart tricky mixed assemblages of fossils and shed light on broader anatomical and biogeographic trends in an iconic group of animals, said co author Dr. Michelle Stocker, a paleobiologist at Virginia Tech.

The discovery is reported March 20 in the online edition of the Journal of Medical Entomology. Two small holes in the back of the Amblyomma tick, which allowed blood to ooze out just as the tick became stuck in tree sap that later fossilized into amber, provide a brief glimpse of life in a tropical jungle millions of years ago in what is now the Dominican Republic. These two tiny holes indicate that something picked a tick off the mammal it was feeding on, puncturing it in the process and dropping it immediately into tree sap, said Oregon State University Professor George Poinar, Jr., author of the study. This would be consistent with the grooming behavior of monkeys that we know lived at that time in this region, he added. The amber specimen was obtained from mines located in the Cordillera Septentrional of the Dominican Republic. Estimated ages range from 1523\u2009million years, based on foraminifera counts, to 30 45 million years, based on coccoliths, Prof. Poinar said. The discovery also describes the only known fossils of a type of extant parasite, Babesia Theileria microti, which infects the blood cells of humans and other animals. The fossilized blood cells, infected with these parasites, are simply amazing in their detail. This discovery provides the only known fossils of Babesia type pathogens, Prof. Poinar said. This parasite was clearly around millions of years before humans, and appears to have evolved alongside primates, among other hosts. He added part of what makes these fossils unique is the clarity by which the parasites and blood cells are preserved, almost as if they had been stained and otherwise treated in a laboratory for inspection. The parasites were different enough in texture and density to stand out clearly within the erythrocytes during the natural embalming process for which amber is famous. "}, {"title": " Daspletosaurus horneri: New Tyrannosaur Species Discovered", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 2, 2017", "doc": "Paleontologists have unveiled a remarkable new species of tyrannosaurine dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous epoch  a cousin of the fearsome predator Tyrannosaurus rex. The newly discovered dinosaur is called Daspletosaurus horneri, or the Horners frightful lizard. It is named for the renowned paleontologist, John Jack R. Horner, formerly curator at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana. According to the paleontologists who discovered it, this species lived in what is now Montana between 75.2 and 74.4 million years ago. The beast was a type of tyrannosaur, a group of giant predatory dinosaurs of the Late Cretaceous from Asia and North America. Daspletosaurus horneri was the youngest, and last, of its lineage that lived after its closest relative, Daspletosaurus torosus, which is found in Alberta, Canada, said Dr. Thomas Carr, a paleontologist at Carthage College and lead author of a report published this week on Daspletosaurus horneri in the journal Scientific Reports. The close evolutionary relationship between the species taken with their geographic proximity and their sequential occurrence suggests that together they represent a single lineage that changed over geological time, where D. torosus has morphed into D. horneri. Its about 75 million years old, so this animal lived about 9 million years before the extinction of the non avian dinosaurs, added co author Dr. Eric Roberts, from James Cook University. In geological terms, the beast was the youngest of the Daspletosaurus clan. With a body length of 29.5 feet 9 m and a height of 7.2 feet 2.2\u2009m, Daspletosaurus horneri had a wide snout, small orbital horns and slit like pneumatic opening on the inside of the lacrimal bone. The large horn behind the eye is elevated beyond the side of the head, indicating a covering of keratin, the hard and shiny material that makes up human fingernails. Its prey were horned dinosaurs ceratopsians, crested duckbill dinosaurs hadrosaurs, dome headed dinosaurs pachycephalosaurs and smaller carnivorous dinosaurs theropods. Dr. Carr, Dr. Roberts and their colleagues worked with well preserved fossils  a skull and skeleton of a subadult, a skull and skeleton of an adult, a partial lower jaw of a subadult, and isolated bones of subadults and juveniles. In addition to adding a new species to the tyrannosaur family tree, the teams research provides new information about the mode of evolution and life appearance of tyrannosaurs. The researchers found evidence for a rare, nonbranching type of evolution in tyrannosaurs and that tyrannosaurs had scaly, lipless faces and a highly touch sensitive snout. It turns out that tyrannosaurs are identical to crocodylians in that the bones of their snouts and jaws are rough, except for a narrow band of smooth bone along the tooth row, Dr. Carr said. In crocodylians, the rough texture occurs deep to large flat scales given the identical texture, tyrannosaurs had the same covering. We did not find any evidence for lips in tyrannosaurs, the rough texture covered by scales extends nearly to the tooth row, providing no space for lips. However, we did find evidence for other types of skin on the face, including areas of extremely coarse bone that supported armor like skin on the snout and on the sides of the lower jaws. The armor like skin would have protected tyrannosaurs from abrasions, perhaps sustained when hunting and feeding. The authors found that, like in crocodylians, the snout and jaws of the tyrannosaurs are penetrated by numerous small nerve openings, allowing hundreds of branches of nerves to innervate the skin, producing a sensitivity similar to that of human fingertips. This sensitivity is part of a bigger evolutionary story, said co author Prof. Jayc Sedlmayr, from the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center New Orleans. The trigeminal nerve has an extraordinary evolutionary history of developing into wildly different sixth senses in different vertebrates, such as sensing magnetic fields for bird migration, electroreception for predation in the platypus bill or the whisker pits of dolphins, sensing infrared in pit vipers to identify prey, guiding movements in mammals through the use of whiskers, sensing vibrations through the water by alligators and turning the elephant trunk into a sensitive hand similar to what has been done to the entire face of tyrannosaurs.

At least 48 dinosaurian tracksites were found along a 15.5 mile 25 km stretch of rock on the Dampier Peninsula in Australias Kimberley region. The tracksites were concentrated in three main areas along the coast Yanijarri in the north, Walmadany in the middle, and Kardilakan Jajal Buru in the south, the paleontologists said. Thousands of tracks were examined and measured in situ and using three dimensional photogrammetry. The diversity of the tracks around Walmadany was globally unparalleled and made the area the Cretaceous equivalent of the Serengeti, added team leader Dr. Steve Salisbury, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland. It is extremely significant, forming the primary record of non avian dinosaurs in the western half the continent and providing the only glimpse of Australias dinosaur fauna during the first half of the Early Cretaceous Period. Its such a magical place  Australias own Jurassic Park, in a spectacular wilderness setting.  The footprints, dated to between 140 million and 127 million years ago Cretaceous period, range in size from small 20 cm, or 8 inches to very large almost 1.7 m, or 5.6 feet. Of the tracks examined, 150 can confidently be assigned to 21 specific track types, representing four main groups of dinosaurs i theropods three toed bipedal carnivores ii sauropods massive, long necked quadrupedal herbivores iii ornithopods bipedal herbivores iv and thyreophorans armored quadrupedal herbivores covered in plates and spikes. Among the tracks is the only confirmed evidence for stegosaurs in Australia, Dr. Salisbury noted. There are also some of the largest dinosaur tracks ever recorded. Some of the sauropod tracks are around 1.7 m long. The dinosaur tracks have always been known to the Aboriginal custodians of the land. For thousands of years, tracks in the 130 million year old sandstone have been part of the cultural heritage of the people of the Dampier Peninsula and greater west Kimberley, the researchers said. The tracks are integral to a song cycle that extends along the coast from Bunginygun to Wabana then inland to the southeast over a total distance of approximately 280 miles 450 km, tracing the journey of a Dreamtime creator being known as Marala, or Emu Man. These trackways are of international significance, Dr. Salisbury added. The glimpse of a 130 million year old world that they provide is awe inspiring. But it is the linking of these track sites into the songline and associated indigenous culture that adds a whole other dimension to their significance. The scientific description of the tracks was published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology on March 24, 2017.

An international team of paleontologists led by Yale researcher Peter Crane discovered the fossils  from the extinct plant Umaltolepis mongoliensis  in ancient peat deposits at the Tevshiin Govi mine in the steppes of central Mongolia. The stems and leaves are similar to the ginkgo tree, but the seeds, and especially the structures they are born in, are unlike any other known plant, living or extinct. Finding something like this does not happen very often, said team member Dr. Patrick Herendeen, from the Chicago Botanic Garden. Paleontologists had previously uncovered fossils of Umaltolepis, but those were in poor condition, making them difficult to study. Hundreds of better preserved new specimens show that features of the stems and leaves are similar to those of Ginkgo biloba. However, the seed bearing structures are not like those of todays ginkgo tree, Dr. Herendeen said. Ginkgo has large seeds with a fleshy outer covering, but Umaltolepis mongoliensis has small, winged seeds. As they developed, Umaltolepis mongoliensis seeds were protected inside a tough, resinous, umbrella like outer covering, which stayed almost completely closed, opening only to release the seeds. The key to determining how Umaltolepis mongoliensis is related to other seed plants lies in understanding its strange seed bearing capsules. While the Umaltolepis mongoliensis seeds are dissimilar to those of any other living or extinct plant, preliminary comparisons connect them with the seed bearing structures of two groups of extinct plants that may be part of the ginkgo lineage. These comparisons and the unique features of Umaltolepis mongoliensis indicate that ginkgo is the last living member of a group of plants that was much more diverse and important in the past. Umaltolepis mongoliensis provides new data for understanding relationships among living and fossil seed plants and supports previous ideas that Ginkgo biloba may be the sole surviving relict of a once very diverse group of Mesozoic seed plants, the researchers said. Research describing Umaltolepis mongoliensis is published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Cascolus ravitis, a member of the stem group of Leptostraca, is a distant relative of the living lobsters, shrimps and crabs. This ancient crustacean lived during the Silurian period, approximately 430 million years ago. University of Leicester Professor David Siveter, one of the paleontologists who made the discovery, said such a well preserved fossil is exciting, and this particular one is a unique example of its kind in the fossil record, and so we can establish it as a new species of a new genus. Its scientific name honors Sir David Attenborough, who grew up on University College Leicester campus. Latin castrum stronghold and colus dwelling in alluding to the MiddleOld English source for the surname Attenborough, derived from atten at the and burgh a fortified place. Latin Ratae, the Roman name for Leicester, vita life and commeatis a messenger, the researchers explained. In my youth, David Attenboroughs early programs on the BBC, such as Zoo Quest, greatly encouraged my interest in Natural History and it is a pleasure to honor him in this way, Prof. Siveter said. The biggest compliment that a biologist or paleontologist can pay to another one is to name a fossil in his honor and I take this as a very great compliment, Sir David Attenborough said. I was once a scientist so Im very honored and flattered that the Professor should say such nice things about me now. The find comes from volcanic ash deposits that accumulated in a marine setting in what is now Herefordshire in the Welsh Borderland, UK. The Herefordshire Konservat Lagerst\u00e4tte in the Welsh Borderland is globally important as a source of unparalleled paleobiological and phylogenetic data on a diversity of Mid Silurian 430 million years ago invertebrate animals, Prof. Siveter and colleagues said. These include a brachiopod, a polychaete worm, aplacophorans, a gastropod, a stem group asteroid, and most abundantly a range of arthropods comprising a stem group euarthropod, a pycnogonid and other chelicerates, a marrellomorph, stem group mandibulates, four ostracod species, a barnacle, a phyllocarid and a pentastomid. The Herefordshire biota lived within the Welsh depositional basin, probably in a slope setting at water depths of 100200 m, they said. The remarkably preserved nature of Cascolus ravitis, with no sign of distortion even of the extremely fine flagella, suggests that, like other animals of the Lagerst\u00e4tte, it was preserved rapidly in vivo. Some 430 million years ago much of southern Britain was positioned in warm southerly subtropical latitudes, quite close to a large ancient continent of what we now call North America, and was covered by a shallow sea, Prof. Siveter added. Cascolus ravitis and other animals living there died and were preserved when a fine volcanic ash rained down upon them. The new fossil is described as exceptionally well preserved in three dimensions  complete with the soft parts of the animal, such as legs, eyes and very delicate antennae. Even though it is relatively small, at just 9 mm long, it preserves incredible detail including body parts that are normally not fossilized, Prof. Siveter said. The cephalized post antennulary appendages of Cascolus ravitis are clearly specialized for feeding and its gnathobases probably functioned to process and channel food to the mouth, although there is no obvious food groove. Like many of its arthropod faunal associates Cascolus ravitis may have been nektobenthic, the scientists said. The large stalked eyes of Cascolus ravitis indicate an almost all round field of view. As in most mandibulates the first head appendage of Cascolus ravitis probably functioned as a sensory receptor of environmental conditions. The research is published this week in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Dinosaurs were first recognized as a unique group of fossil reptiles in 1842 as a result of the work of the anatomist, Professor Richard Owen, who later went on to found the Natural History Museum in London. Over subsequent decades, various species were named as more and more fossils were found and identified. During the latter half of the 19th century it was realized that dinosaurs were anatomically diverse and attempts were made to classify them into groups that shared particular features. It was Harry Govier Seeley, a paleontologist trained in Cambridge under the renowned geologist Adam Sedgwick, who determined that dinosaurs fell quite neatly into two distinct groupings, or clades Saurischia or Ornithischia. This classification was based on the arrangement of the creatures hip bones and in particular whether they displayed a lizard like pattern Saurischia or a bird like one Ornithischia. As more dinosaurs were described it became clear that they belonged to three distinct lineages Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha and Theropoda. In 1887 Seeley placed the sauropodomorphs which included the huge classic dinosaurs such as Diplodocus and Brontosaurus together with the theropods which included T. rex, in the Saurischia. The ornithischians and saurischians were at first thought to be unrelated, each having a different set of ancestors, but later study showed that they all evolved from a single common ancestor. The new analysis of dinosaurs and their near relatives concludes that the ornithischians need to be grouped with the theropods, to the exclusion of the sauropodomorphs. It has long been known that birds with their obviously bird like hips evolved from theropod dinosaurs with their lizard like hips. However, the re grouping of dinosaurs proposed by the authors shows that both ornithischians and theropods had the potential to evolve a bird like hip arrangement  they just did so at different times in their history. When we started our analysis, we puzzled as to why some ancient ornithischians appeared anatomically similar to theropods, said study lead author Matthew Baron, a Ph.D. student in earth science at the University of Cambridge. Our fresh study suggested that these two groups were indeed part of the same clade. This conclusion came as quite a shock since it ran counter to everything wed learned. The carnivorous theropods were more closely related to the herbivorous ornithischians and, whats more, some animals, such as Diplodocus, would fall outside the traditional grouping that we called dinosaurs, he added. This meant we would have to change the definition of the dinosaur to make sure that, in the future, Diplodocus and its near relatives could still be classed as dinosaurs. The revised grouping of Ornithischia and Theropoda has been named the Ornithoscelida which revives a name originally coined by the evolutionary biologist, Thomas Henry Huxley in 1870. The repercussions of this research are both surprising and profound, said co author Dr. David Norman, also from the University of Cambridge. The bird hipped dinosaurs, so often considered paradoxically named because they appeared to have nothing to do with bird origins, are now firmly attached to the ancestry of living birds.  While analyzing the dinosaur family trees, the researchers arrived at another unexpected conclusion. For many years, it was thought that dinosaurs originated in the southern hemisphere on the ancient continent known as Gondwana. The oldest dinosaur fossils have been recovered from South America suggesting the earliest dinosaurs originated there. But as a result of a re examination of key taxa its now thought they could just as easily have originated on the northern landmass known as Laurasia, though it must be remembered that the continents were much closer together at this time. This study radically redraws the dinosaur family tree, providing a new framework for unraveling the evolution of their key features, biology and distribution through time, said study co author Prof. Paul Barrett, from the Natural History Museum, London. If were correct, it explains away many prior inconsistencies in our knowledge of dinosaur anatomy and relationships and it also highlights several new questions relating to the pace and geographical setting of dinosaur origins. The research appears today in the journal Nature.  Matthew G. Baron et al. A new hypothesis of dinosaur relationships and early dinosaur evolution.

Analyzing a well preserved fossil of Doliodus problematicus, a sharklike fish that lived 400 397 million years ago Devonian period, AMNH curator John Maisey and co authors identified it as an important transitional species that points to sharks as ancanthodians living descendants. Major vertebrate evolutionary transitions, such as fin to limb and dinosaur to bird are substantiated by numerous fossil discoveries. By contrast, the much earlier rise of sharklike fishes within jawed vertebrates is poorly documented, Dr. Maisey said. Although this fish to fish transition involved less profound anatomical reorganization than the evolutions of tetrapods or birds, it is no less important for informing the evolutionary origins of modern vertebrate diversity. In 2003, this question in vertebrate evolution was revitalized by the discovery of a remarkable fossil skeleton of Doliodus problematicus in New Brunswick, Canada. When its discovery was announced, Doliodus problematicus was shown to have paired spines in front of its pectoral shoulder fins, a feature otherwise known mainly in acanthodians. But in 2009 and 2014, Dr. Maisey and his colleagues determined that the animals head, skeleton, and teeth were actually more like those of sharks than acanthodians. The new study, based on computed tomography CT imaging, uncovered even more spines that are buried inside the matrix of the fossil. These spines likely lined the underside of the fish, a distinguishing characteristic of acanthodians that confirms the fossil is evidence of an important transitional species. The arrangement of these spines shows unequivocally that this fish was basically an acanthodian with a sharks head, pectoral skeleton, and teeth, Dr. Maisey said.

The extraordinarily preserved fossils came from phosphorite deposits at Jankikund, Chitrakoot, central India. The samples were analyzed by Professor Stefan Bengtson at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and co authors. The researchers found two kinds of fossils resembling red algae one type is thread like named Rafatazmia chitrakootensis, another consists of fleshy colonies Ramathallus lobatus. The finds predate the previously earliest accepted red algae by about 400 million years, suggesting that eukaryotes may have a longer history than commonly assumed. The last common ancestor of modern eukaryotes is generally believed to have lived during the Mesoproterozoic era, about 1.6 to 1 billion years ago, or possibly somewhat earlier, Prof. Bengtson and his colleagues said. We studied exquisitely preserved fossil communities from 1.6 billion year old sedimentary rocks in central India representing a shallow water marine environment characterized by photosynthetic biomats. We discovered amidst extensive cyanobacterial mats a biota of filamentous and lobate organisms that share significant features with modern eukaryotic algae, more specifically red algae. The team was able to look inside the algae with the help of synchrotron based X ray tomographic microscopy. The rocks mainly consist of calcium and magnesium carbonates, but the microbial mats and the fossils are preserved in calcium phosphate, letting us view the cellular and subcellular structures in three dimensions with the use of synchrotron radiation X ray tomographic microscopy, the researchers explained. Among other things, they found regularly recurring platelets in each cell, which they believe are parts of chloroplasts, the organelles within plant cells where photosynthesis takes place. They also found distinct and regular structures at the center of each cell wall, typical of red algae. The earliest traces of life on Earth are at least 3.77 billion years old. Those single celled organisms, unlike eukaryotes, lack nuclei and other organelles, the scientists said. Large multicellular eukaryotes became common much later, about 600 million years ago, near the transition to the Phanerozoic Eon, the time of visible life. The time of visible life seems to have begun much earlier than we thought, added Prof. Bengtson, lead author of a paper about the discovery in the journal PLoS Biology. "}, {"title": " New Hypothesis for Origin of Terrestrial Vertebrates Proposed", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 10, 2017", "doc": "It was the power of the eyes  not the limbs  that first led our ancient aquatic ancestors to make the leap from water to land, according to a team of scientists led by Northwestern University Professor Malcolm MacIver and Lars Schmitz of Claremont McKenna, Scripps and Pitzer Colleges. Prof. MacIver, Dr. Schmitz and their colleagues studied the fossil record and discovered that eyes nearly tripled in size before  not after  the water to land transition. The tripling coincided with a shift in location of the eyes from the side of the head to the top. The expanded visual range of seeing through air may have eventually led to larger brains in early terrestrial vertebrates and the ability to plan and not merely react, as fish do. Why did we come up onto land 385 million years ago Devonian period? We are the first to think that vision might have something to do with it, explained Prof. MacIver, who is the lead author of a paper describing the research, published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. We found a huge increase in visual capability in vertebrates just before the transition from water to land. Our hypothesis is that maybe it was seeing an unexploited cornucopia of food on land  millipedes, centipedes, spiders and more  that drove evolution to come up with limbs from fins. Invertebrates came onto land 50 million years before our vertebrate ancestors made that transition. The enlargement of eyes is significant. By just popping those eyes above the water line, the fish could see 70 times farther in air than in water. With the tripling of eye size, the animals visually monitored space increased a millionfold. This happened millions of years before fully terrestrial animals existed. Bigger eyes are almost worthless in water because vision is largely limited to whats directly in front of the animal, Dr. Schmitz said. But larger eye size is very valuable when viewing through air. In evolution, it often comes down to a trade off. Is it worth the metabolic toll to enlarge your eyes? Whats the point? Here we think the point was to be able to search out prey on land. The team studied 59 fossil specimens spanning the time before the water to land transition, during the transition and after the transition. Their computer simulations of the animals visual environments  such as clear or murky water in the daytime or above water in the daytime and the nighttime  show that the benefit of increased eye size would be realized when an animal is seeing through air, not water. The researchers measured the size of each fossils orbits, or eye sockets, and head length. From that, they determined the size of the eyes and the size of the animal itself. They found that before the water to land transition the average orbit size was 13 mm and around the time of transition the average size was 36 mm. The tripling of orbit size took 12 million years. This is the timescale of evolution, which boggles our mind, Prof. MacIver said. The massive increase in visual capability enabled by vision in air likely allowed early limbed animals to evolve more complex cognition. These animals were no longer forced to react with split second speed as was required by life in the vision limiting water. Eventually, evolution led to the human capability of prospective cognition the power to weigh options for the future and to choose strategically, the researchers said.  Malcolm A. MacIver et al.

Ichthyosaurs  predatory marine reptiles that ranged in size from 1 to 69 feet 0.3  21 m long  swam the worlds oceans for millions of years during the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Despite their profound adaptations to the aquatic realm and their apparent success throughout Triassic and Jurassic periods, these reptiles disappeared roughly 30 million years before the end Cretaceous mass extinction 65 million years ago that marked the end for dinosaurs and the beginning of the age of mammals. Ichthyosaurs were the first, large extinct reptiles brought to the attention of the scientific world. Many ichthyosaur fossils were found in England during the early 19th century, but it was not until 1821 that the first ichthyosaur species, Ichthyosaurus communis, was described. This species has become one of the most well known and iconic of all the British fossil reptiles. In 1822, three other species were described, based on differences in the shape and structure of their teeth. Two of the species were later re identified as other types of ichthyosaur, whereas one of these species, called Ichthyosaurus intermedius, was still considered closely related to I. communis. In the years that followed, many eminent paleontologists, including Sir Richard Owen the man who coined the word dinosaur, studied ichthyosaur fossils collected in England. Their studies and observations of Ichthyosaurus communis and I. intermedius resulted in confusion with the species, with many skeletons identified on unreliable grounds. The early accounts of ichthyosaurs were based on very scrappy, often isolated, remains. This resulted in a very poor understanding of the differences between species and thus how to identify them, Lomax said. To complicate matters further, the original specimen of Ichthyosaurus communis is lost and was never illustrated. Similarly, the original specimen of I. intermedius is also lost, but an illustration does exist. This has caused a big headache for paleontologists trying to understand the differences between the species. In the 1970s, paleontologist Dr. Chris McGowan was the first to suggest that Ichthyosaurus communis and I. intermedius may represent the same species. He could not find reliable evidence to separate the two species. Subsequent studies argued for and against the separation of the species. In a new study, published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, Lomax and Prof. Massare have reviewed all of the research for and against the separation of the two species. This is the most extensive scientific study ever published comparing the two. The authors confirm the species are the same and that features of Ichthyosaurus intermedius can be found in other ichthyosaur species, including I. communis.

Woolly mammoths Mammuthus primigenius were among the most common large herbivores in North America, Siberia, and Beringia during the Pleistocene and early Holocene. However warming climates and human predation led to extinction on the mainland roughly 10,000 years ago. Lone isolated island populations persisted out of human reach until roughly 3,700 years ago when the species finally went extinct. In the new study, University of California Berkeley researchers Dr. Rebekah Rogers and Dr. Montgomery Slatkin compared existing genomes from a mainland mammoth that dates back to 45,000 years ago, when the animal was plentiful, to one that lived about 4,300 years ago on Wrangel Island, an isolated island in the Arctic Ocean that was separated from the mainland by rising sea levels about 12,000 years ago. One specimen is derived from the Siberian mainland at Oimyakon, dated to 45,000 years ago. This sample comes from a time when mammoth populations were plentiful, with estimated effective population size of 13,000 individuals, the scientists explained. The second specimen is from Wrangel Island off the north Siberian coast. This sample from 4,300 years ago represents one of the last known mammoth specimens. This individual comes from a small population estimated to contain roughly 300 individuals. These two specimens offer the rare chance to explore the ways the genome responds to pre extinction population dynamics. The analysis showed that the Wrangel Island mammoth had accumulated multiple harmful mutations in its genome, which interfered with gene functions. The animals had lost many olfactory receptors, which detect odors, as well as urinary proteins, which can impact social status and mate choice. The genome also revealed that the Wrangel Island mammoth had specific mutations that likely created an unusual translucent satin coat. We observe an excess of detrimental mutations, consistent with genomic meltdown in woolly mammoths on Wrangel Island just prior to extinction, Dr. Rogers and Dr. Slatkin said. We observe an excess of deletions, an increase in the proportion of deletions affecting gene sequences, and an excess of premature stop codons in response to evolution under low effective population sizes. Large numbers of olfactory receptors appear to have loss of function mutations in the island mammoth. We also observe two independent loss of function mutations at the FOXQ1 locus, likely conferring a satin coat in this unusual woolly mammoth. For those interested in wooly mammoth de extinction, this study demonstrates that some mammoth genomes carry an overabundance of negative mutations. The work also offers a warning to conservationists preserving a small group of isolated animals is not sufficient to stop negative effects of inbreeding and genomic meltdown.

The fossil, encased in a piece of amber from Spain, is shedding new light on the various ways insects pollinated plants during the mid Mesozoic era. Darwinylus marcosi died in a sticky gob of tree sap some 105 million years ago in what is now Spain, the researchers said. As it thrashed about before drowning, more than 100 clumped pollen grains were dislodged from its body and released into the resin. Five grains remained stuck to the beetle itself. Preserved with the beetle in the now hard amber, the grains reveal that Darwinylus marcosi had been chewing a pollen meal with its jaw like mouthparts just before it died. The amber dates to a time when flowering plants angiosperms were just beginning to appear and the Earth was overwhelmingly dominated by non flowering plant species gymnosperms, such as cycads, ginkgoaleans, bennettitaleans and conifers. Now, the discovery of Darwinylus marcosi in Spanish amber is proof of a new insect pollination mode that dates to the mid Mesozoic beetles with biting or jaw like mouthparts and a chewing feeding style, said Dr. Conrad Labandeira, a paleobiologist at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History and lead co author of a paper describing the new species in the journal Current Biology. This amber fossil is the first, direct evidence of a fourth major gymnosperm insect pollination mode during this time. Darwinylus marcosi is the latest in a series of recently discovered gymnosperm pollinating insects that flourished during the mid Mesozoic. Lacewings, scorpionflies, flies and moths with long, straw like proboscises siphoned pollination drops. Pollination drops are a liquid similar to the nectar of flowering plants that originate from deep funnel like holes in pine cone like structures and other, often bizarre, gymnosperm ovule bearing organs. Flies Diptera with sponge like mouthparts also lapped up this sweet plant nectar. Thrips Thysanoptera with punch and suck mouthcone mouthparts drained the nutritious juices by cracking pollen grains, performing a different type of pollination. All three of these insect pollinator feeding modes have been found in 165  to 105 million year old amber and stone fossils that show gymnosperm pollen clinging to various mouthpart structures, heads and bodies of these insects. The newly reported discovery reveals the broad pattern of four distinctive pollinator modes that were present before the dominance of flowering plants between 125 and 90 million years ago, Dr. Labandeira said. These pollinator modes survive to the present day, although the particular plant and insect participants are mostly long gone. Modern relatives of Darwinylus marcosi, the family Oedemeridae false blister beetles, today pollinate flowering plants rather than gymnosperms. The amber fossil reveals that these beetles are one of a number of gymnosperm pollinators that successfully made the transition to feeding on and pollinating flowering plants, Dr. Labandeira said. In the Cretaceous, many gymnosperms and the insects that pollinated them went extinct in a world wide shake up during the Aptian Albian Gap between 125 to 90 million years ago. This period is well documented in the fossil record as gymnosperm diversity plunged and flowering plants soon came to dominate the Earth during a 35 million year long transition. Those insect pollinators that depended upon gymnosperms and couldnt make the transition became extinct. The very few that remained with the gymnosperms and survived saw a major drop in their diversity. Most gymnosperms today, such as conifers and the ginkgo, are wind pollinated far fewer gymnosperms, such as the cycads and an unusual group known as gnetaleans, are insect pollinated.

The discovery was reported online today in the journal Nature. Microscopic filaments and tubes formed by ancient iron loving bacteria were found encased in quartz layers in the Nuvvuagittuq Supracrustal Belt NSB. The NSB contains some of the oldest sedimentary rocks known on the planet which likely formed part of an iron rich hydrothermal vent system that provided a habitat for Earths first life forms between 3.77 and 4.3 billion years ago. Before this find, the earliest accepted evidence for life were 3.7 billion year old stromatolite fossils from the Isua Greenstone Belt in south west Greenland. Our discovery supports the idea that life emerged from hot, seafloor vents shortly after planet Earth formed, said Matthew Dodd, a Ph.D. student at the University College London and first author on the study. This speedy appearance of life on Earth fits with other evidence of recently discovered 3.7 billion year old sedimentary mounds that were shaped by microorganisms. Dodd and co authors found the filaments and tubes inside centimeter sized structures called concretions or nodules, as well as other tiny spheroidal structures, called rosettes and granules, all of which they think are the products of putrefaction. They are mineralogically identical to those in younger rocks from Norway, the Great Lakes area of North America and Western Australia, said study lead author Dr. Dominic Papineau, also from the University College London.  The researchers looked at the ways the tubes and filaments, made of hematite  the mineral form of iron III oxide Fe2O3  could have been made through non biological methods such as temperature and pressure changes in the rock during burial of the sediments, but found all of the possibilities unlikely. The hematite structures have the same characteristic branching of iron oxidizing bacteria found near other hydrothermal vents today and were found alongside graphite and minerals like apatite and carbonate which are found in biological matter including bones and teeth and are frequently associated with fossils. The team also found that the mineralized fossils are associated with spheroidal structures that usually contain fossils in younger rocks, suggesting that the hematite most likely formed when bacteria that oxidized iron for energy were fossilized in the rock. The structures are composed of the minerals expected to form from putrefaction, and have been well documented throughout the geological record, from the beginning until today, Dr. Papineau said. The fact we unearthed them from one of the oldest known rock formations, suggests weve found direct evidence of one of Earths oldest life forms. These discoveries demonstrate life developed on Earth at a time when Mars and Earth had liquid water at their surfaces, posing exciting questions for extraterrestrial life, Dodd said. Therefore, we expect to find evidence for past life on Mars 4 billion years ago, or if not, Earth may have been a special exception.

The fossil was found by amateur fossil collector Leigh Love in the Waipara Greensand at Waipara River, Canterbury Province, New Zealand. It was analyzed by a team of paleontologists from Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt, Germany. According to the researchers, the new find is one of the oldest penguin fossils in the world. Together with the fossils of the recently discovered penguin like bird Waimanu manneringi, the new specimens are the earliest published penguin remains, they said. The newly discovered bird waddled the Earth during the Paleocene epoch. It was about 5 feet 1.5 m tall, making it almost as big as Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi the largest known fossil penguin, which lived in Antarctica between 45 and 33 million years ago. Penguins had reached enormous proportions early on in their evolutionary history and were already more diverse 60 million years ago than we had previously assumed, said team member Dr. Gerald Mayr, of the Senckenberg Research Institute. This diversity indicates that penguins probably evolved during the Age of the Dinosaurs more than 65 million years ago. The birds bones differ substantially from previous penguin finds of a similar age and show that the variety of Paleocene penguins was greater than previously thought. The flattened and wide tarsometatarsus of the new taxon from the Waipara Greensand exhibits a much more derived morphology than the tarsometatarsus of Waimanu and clearly stems from a taxon that is situated more crownward than Waimanu in the phylogenetic tree of penguins, the researchers said. The new penguin presumably moved with the upright, waddling gait characteristic for todays penguins. The newly discovered bird walked differently from the cormorant like gait of Waimanu. The larger penguin was already waddling like the penguins we see today, said team member Dr. Vanesa De Pietri, from Canterbury Museum.

The team, led by Lund University Professor Mats Eriksson, studied an ancient fossil, which has been stored at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto since the 1990s, and discovered the remains of the extinct bristle worm. The study material is of Early Middle Devonian age and derives from the Kwataboahegan Formation, Hudson Bay Basin, Ontario, Canada, Prof. Eriksson and co authors explained. The material is housed in the Invertebrate Palaeontology Section, Department of Natural History at the Royal Ontario Museum. The new species, Websteroprion armstrongi, is unique among fossil worms and possessed the largest jaws ever recorded in this type of creature, reaching over 1 cm 0.4 inches in length and easily visible to the naked eye. Typically, such fossil jaws are 0.1 2\u2009mm in size and need to be studied using microscopes. Total body length of Websteroprion armstrongi is estimated to have reached over 1 m 3.3 feet, which is comparable to that of extant giant eunicid species colloquially referred to as Bobbit worms these worms are fearsome and opportunistic ambush predators, using their powerful jaws to capture prey such as fish and cephalopods and dragging them into their burrows. Gigantism in animals is an alluring and ecologically important trait, usually associated with advantages and competitive dominance, Prof. Eriksson said. It is, however, a poorly understood phenomenon among marine worms and has never before been demonstrated in a fossil species. Websteroprion armstrongi demonstrates a unique case of polychaete gigantism in the Paleozoic, some 400 million years ago. It also shows that gigantism in jaw bearing polychaetes was restricted to one particular evolutionary clade within the Eunicida and has evolved many times in different species, added team member Dr. Luke Parry, from the University of Bristol.

The fossils came from the Miocene Camacho Formation in the R\u00edo de la Plata coastal region of southern Uruguay. We describe fully grown adult and juvenile fossil specimens from the rodent family Dinomyidae, collected from the same location, lithostratigraphical formation and fossiliferous horizon, the researchers said. They examined the specimens and compared them with previously published fossils and with the largest living rodent, the capybara Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris. The juvenile and the adult analyzed here represent some of the largest rodents known to science with some of these animals weighing almost a ton, Dr. Rinderknecht and co authors said. The adult remains consist of an almost complete skull with a partial jaw, while the juveniles remains are of a complete lower jaw and right heel. Almost all previous discoveries of this kind have consisted of isolated teeth, and small fragments of skulls or jaws, which make this discovery some of the best preserved remains of giant dinomids known to date. The results cast doubt on the validity of the subfamily Gyriabrinae, which may be composed of juveniles of different species within other subfamilies of Dinomyidae. We propose that members of the subfamily Gyriabrinae could represent juveniles belonging to other subfamilies of Dinomyidae, and that three known species of the genus Isostylomys should be merged into just one species, Isostylomys laurillardi, the scientists said. Our study shows how the worlds largest fossil rodents grow and we describe fossil remains of a giant rodent baby and an adult, Dr. Rinderknecht added.

Dr. Mark Witton from the University of Portsmouth and Dr. Darren Naish from University of Southampton examined the recently discovered neck vertebra of Hatzegopteryx. They believe the ancient creature was a formidable carnivore and major predator that terrorized dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals of the Late Cretaceous Romania. Hatzegopteryx is a member of Azhdarchidae, a group of long necked, long jawed pterosaurs. However, the researchers suggest Hatzegopteryx had a considerably shorter and stronger neck, and with larger muscle masses. Other remains of Hatzegopteryx include a jaw joint indicative of a 50 cm wide skull and reinforced limb bones. The proportions and structural reinforcement of all these elements are unlike those of any other azhdarchid species and would have made Hatzegopteryx a powerful and dominant predator, Dr. Witton said. The difference in structural properties between giant azhdarchid neck bones is remarkable  theyre in different biomechanical leagues, with Hatzegopteryx many times stronger than anything else on record. This, along with our calculations of neck length and muscle mass, suggests giant azhdarchids may have been radically different in appearance and behavior. The large, reinforced skeleton and muscle power would have made it a formidable predator of other animals when stalking ancient prairies and woodlands. It may have even been capable of attacking animals too large or vigorous for other flying reptiles, even the other giants. Hatzegopteryx lived in a peculiar island ecosystem where many of the dinosaurs were dwarfed or belonged to relict lineages extinct in the rest of the Cretaceous world. Ancient Transylvania was a strange place for a number of reasons, including the fact that weve yet to find evidence of large predatory animals that lived alongside Hatzegopteryx, such as giant carnivorous dinosaurs. This is despite centuries of sampling, Dr. Witton said. This work thus potentially provides an answer to a mystery about life in Late Cretaceous Romania. Perhaps without large predators to challenge them, this island provided an opportunity for giant pterosaurs  already formidable animals  to become the dominant predators, Dr. Witton said. The finer details of ecology and lifestyle for Hatzegopteryx remain unknown because were still working from scraps of its skeleton, but the emerging picture of its lifestyle are fascinating. In some respects our unexpected findings highlight how little we actually know about these animals. Weve had these scrappy remains for years, but we need to ask the right questions, and perform the right tests, to realize their significance. Future giant pterosaur research and discoveries almost certainly have many more surprises for us. The study was published online Jan. 18, 2017 in the journal PeerJ.

Euchambersia mirabilis was a small, dog like creature that grew between 1.3 and 1.6 feet 40 50 cm long, and lived well before the first dinosaur appeared. The two known fossils of Euchambersia mirabilis were found  the first in 1932, and the second in 1966  on the farm Vanwyksfontein, near Colesberg in South Africa, and while they were found more than 34 years apart from each other, for millions of years, they were lying only a few feet apart. According to a new study published in the journal PLoS ONE, Euchambersia mirabilis represents the earliest known venomous terrestrial vertebrate, and one of the best supported cases of an extinct venomous species. What is even more surprising is that it is not in a species that we expected it to be, said lead author Dr. Julien Benoit, a paleontologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa. Today, snakes are notorious for their venomous bite, but their fossil record vanishes in the depth of geological times at about 167 million years ago, so, at 260 million years ago, Euchambersia mirabilis evolved venom more than a 100 million years before the very first snake was even born. As venom glands dont fossilize, Dr. Benoit and co authors used CT scanning and 3D imagery techniques to analyze the two Euchambersia skulls, and discovered stunning anatomical adaptations that are compatible with venom production. First, a wide, deep and circular fossa  a space in the skull  to accommodate a venom gland was present on the upper jaw and was connected to the canine and the mouth by a fine network of bony grooves and canals, Dr. Benoit explained. Moreover, we discovered previously undescribed teeth hidden in the vicinity of the bones and rock two incisors with preserved crowns and a pair of large canines, that all had a sharp ridge. Such a ridged dentition would have helped the injection of venom inside a prey. Unlike snakes like vipers or cobras, which actively inject their prey with venom through needle like grooves in their teeth, Euchambersias venom flowed directly into its mouth, and the venom was passively introduced into its victim through ridges on the outside of its canine teeth. Euchambersia mirabilis could have used its venom for protection or hunting, the researchers said. Most venomous species today use their venom for hunting, so I would rather go for this option, Dr. Benoit added. In addition, animals at that time were not all insectivorous, particularly among therapsids, which were very diverse.

Live birth viviparity is well known in mammals, where the mother has a placenta to nourish the developing embryo, said University of Queensland Professor Jonathan Aitchison, senior author of a paper on the discovery published Feb. 14 in the journal Nature Communications. Live birth is also very common among lizards and snakes, where the babies sometimes hatch inside their mother and emerge without a shelled egg. Until recently it was thought the third major group Archosauromorpha, a group that first evolved some 260 million years ago and is represented today by birds and crocodilians, only laid eggs. Indeed, egg laying is the primitive state, seen at the base of reptiles, and in their ancestors such as amphibians and fishes, Prof. Aitchison noted. The new fossil is an unusual, long necked animal called Dinocephalosaurus, an archosauromorph that lived in shallow seas of South China in the Middle Triassic epoch 245 million years ago. The specimen belongs to the recently discovered Luoping biota and shows an embryo inside the mother  clear evidence for live birth. We report the discovery of a pregnant long necked marine reptile Dinocephalosaurus from the Middle Triassic of southwest China showing live birth in archosauromorphs, Prof. Aitchison and co authors said. The researchers said the embryo was inside the mothers rib cage, and it faced forward. Swallowed animals generally face backward because the predator swallows its prey head first to help it go down its throat. Furthermore, the small reptile inside the mother is an example of the same species. Our discovery pushes back evidence of reproductive biology in the clade by roughly 50 million years, and shows that there is no fundamental reason that archosauromorphs could not achieve live birth, they said. Professor Chris Organ from Montana State University, co author of the study, said evolutionary analysis showed that this instance of live birth was also associated with genetic sex determination. Some reptiles today, such as crocodiles, determine the sex of their offspring by the temperature inside the nest, he explained. We identified that Dinocephalosaurus, a distant ancestor of crocodiles, determined the sex of its babies genetically, like mammals and birds. This combination of live birth and genotypic sex determination seems to have been necessary for animals such as Dinocephalosaurus to become aquatic, said University of Bristol Professor Mike Benton, co author of the study. This new specimen from China rewrites our understanding of the evolution of reproductive systems, Prof. Organ added.

The discovery, reported in the journal Nature, sheds new light on the earliest stages in the evolution of mollusks, a group of invertebrates that includes clams, snails and squids. Mollusks consist of a multitude of distinct groups, which all originated about 520 million years ago in a very short period of time, probably less than 20 million years, said Yales Professor Derek Briggs, a co author on the study. Their evolutionary history is squeezed into a brief interval of evolutionary time called the Cambrian explosion, which makes the sequence of events difficult to piece together. The mollusks are amongst the earliest animals identifiable in the fossil record, however determining what their ancestor looked like is difficult since many of the groups appear within a small window of time, making the sequence of evolutionary events difficult to piece together, added lead author Dr. Jakob Vinther, from the University of Bristol, UK. One of the defining characteristics of the mollusks is the possession of a radula, a kind of toothed tongue which is used to rake up or rasp food. The radula houses hundreds of teeth, the patterns of which can be used to determine diet and identify species. Whilst not all mollusks have a radula, a radula cannot be found in any other group of animals. The newly discovered species, Calvapilosa kroegeri, resembles a slug covered with short spines all over its upper body and with a large fingernail like shell over its head. In the center of the head of this new species are two rows of teeth which the researchers demonstrate is a radula. The discovery of this structure firmly identifies Calvapilosa kroegeri as a mollusk. Additionally, it suggests that similar fossil forms from the Burgess Shale in Canada Orthrozanclus and Sirius Passet in Greenland Halkieria are also mollusks and possessed a radula. Following an analysis to determine the family tree of mollusks, Calvapilosa kroegeri was revealed to be the most primitive member of the lineage leading to chitons. Chitons can still be found today and are characterized by their possession of eight shell plates and spines around their margin, similar to what is seen covering the body of the new species. If we trace back the evolution of chitons, we can see that the number of their shells has increased with time, Dr. Vinther said. It is therefore likely that the ancestor to all mollusks was single shelled and covered in bristle like spines, not dissimilar to Calvapilosa kroegeri. Calvapilosa kroegeri came from a fossil rich deposit near Zagora in southeastern Morocco known as the Ordovician Fezouata Formation. Morocco has revealed itself as a fossil treasure trove for ancient life, said co author Dr. Peter Van Roy, of Ghent University in Belgium.

The ancient animal, named Saccorhytus coronarius, is the most primitive example of a so called deuterostome. The creature is thought to be the common ancestor of a huge range of species, and the earliest step yet discovered on the evolutionary path that eventually led to humans, hundreds of millions of years later. Forty five phosphatized specimens of Saccorhytus coronaries were collected from the Kuanchuanpu Formation, Hexi, Xixiang County, Shaanxi Province, central China. They were analyzed by experts from the University of Cambridge in the UK, the University of Kassel in Germany, Northwest University, China University of Geosciences and Xian Shiyou University in China. The research was published in the journal Nature on January 30, 2017. To the naked eye, the fossils we studied look like tiny black grains, but under the microscope the level of detail is jaw dropping. All deuterostomes had a common ancestor, and we think that is what we are looking at here, said lead co author Prof. Simon Conway Morris, from the University of Cambridge. Our team has notched up some important discoveries in the past, including the earliest fish and a remarkable variety of other early deuterostomes, added lead co author Dr. Degan Shu, from Northwest University. Saccorhytus coronarius now gives us remarkable insights into the very first stages of the evolution of a group that led to the fish, and ultimately, to us. Most other early deuterostome groups are from about 510 to 520 million years ago, when they had already begun to diversify into not just the vertebrates, but the sea squirts, echinoderms and hemichordates. This level of diversity has made it extremely difficult to work out what an earlier, common ancestor might have looked like. By isolating the microfossils from the surrounding rock, and then studying them both under an electron microscope and using a CT scan, the paleontologists were able to build up a picture of how Saccorhytus coronarius might have looked and lived. This revealed features and characteristics consistent with current assumptions about primitive deuterostomes. Saccorhytus coronarius was about a millimeter in size, and probably lived between grains of sand on the seabed. Its body was bilaterally symmetrical  a characteristic inherited by many of its descendants, including humans  and was covered with a thin, relatively flexible skin. The body is hemi ellipsoidal, with a maximum length of 1,300 \u03bcm, width 800 \u03bcm and height 900 \u03bcm. Most material is crushed but several specimens confirm original bilateral symmetry, the authors said. This in turn suggests that it had some sort of musculature, leading the team to conclude that it could have made contractile movements, and got around by wriggling. Perhaps its most striking feature, however, was its rather primitive means of eating food and then dispensing with the resulting waste. The animal had a large mouth, relative to the rest of its body, and probably ate by engulfing food particles, or even other creatures. A crucial observation is small conical structures on its body. These may have allowed the water that it swallowed to escape and so were perhaps the evolutionary precursor of the gills we now see in fish. But the scientists were unable to find any evidence that the creature had an anus. If that was the case, then any waste material would simply have been taken out back through the mouth, which from our perspective sounds rather unappealing, Prof. Conway Morris explained. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Find 450-Million-Year-Old Fossilized Trilobite Eggs", "author": "Natali Anderson", "date": "Jan 27, 2017", "doc": "A research team led by Western Illinois University scientist Thomas Hegna has announced the discovery of two pyritized, egg bearing specimens of the Ordovician trilobite Triarthrus eatoni. The two egg bearing specimens of Triarthrus eatoni were found in the Martin Quarry in the Whetstone Gulf Formation in New York, the United States. This is not the first time that supposed trilobite eggs have been identified, Dr. Hegna and co authors said. However, it is the first time that eggs have been positively identified in association with a body fossil. This firmly establishes the identity of the eggs. The ancient eggs, described in a report published this month in the journal Geology, are believed to be about 450 million years old Ordovician period. The eggs are spherical to elliptical in shape, nearly 200 \u03bcm in size, and are clustered in the genal area of the cephalon, paleontologists said. The structures do not fit alternate interpretations. They are too large to be microbial fossils. Their distribution on the exoskeleton would be puzzling for a type of small epibiont, a fecal pellet, or localized pyrite growth. Thus, the structures more readily fit an egg interpretation. Their size, though small, is within the size range known from other modern and fossil arthropods. Notably, the eggs are somewhat smaller than the earliest growth stage of trilobites, the protaspis. The team used a micro CT scanner to get a flipbook of slices through the preserved trilobites and eggs. We digitally dissected the fossils, Dr. Hegna said. The CT scans help us see if the eggs were attached to the body without disturbing the fossil. The eggs have been observed in clusters of 3 to 9 eggs. This is likely a low estimate eggs may have been accidentally destroyed during the air abrasion preparation process, or additional eggs may remain hidden in the sediment, the researchers said. The eggs are only visible ventrally with no dorsal brood pouch or recognized sexual dimorphism. While carrying eggs on the head may seem unusual, it is far from unknown in arthropods, they said. In 1998, researchers proposed that trilobites brooded their eggs in anterior cephalic pouches. One of the trilobites closest living relatives, the horseshoe crab, carries its unfertilized eggs internally within a prosomal ovarian network within the head, though they do not brood them externally. Prior to the teams discovery, nothing was known about an early phase of the development of trilobites. The fact that the eggs are smaller than the earliest known trilobite ontogenetic protaspis stage suggests that trilobites may have had an unmineralized preliminary stage in their ontogeny, and that the protaspis shield formed only after hatching, Dr. Hegna and co authors said. Trilobites likely released their gametes eggs and sperm through a genital pore of as yet unknown location likely near the posterior boundary of the head. If the Triarthrus eatoni reproductive biology is representative of other trilobites, they spawned with external fertilization, possibly the ancestral mode of reproduction for early arthropods.

Amber from Myanmar has revealed very interesting fossils, many of which represent extinct lineages that have no close association with any extant groups, the authors said. Previous examples include flies with horn like protuberances emerging from their heads, a fossil bee with some features carried over from ancestral wasps and a bizarre wingless wasp lacking any indication of a waist. Now we describe a wingless insect that displays features unknown in any extant 59 or extinct insect order. The insect, named Aethiocarenus burmanicus, has a triangular head, almost alien and E.T. like appearance. I had never really seen anything like it, said Prof. George Poinar, Jr., lead author on the paper. This insect has a number of features that just dont match those of any other insect species that I know. Perhaps most unusual was a triangular head with bulging eyes, with the vertex of the right triangle located at the base of the neck. This is different from any other known insect, and would have given this species the ability to see almost 180 degrees by turning its head sideways. The strangest thing is that the head looked so much like the way aliens are often portrayed. With its long neck, big eyes and strange oblong head, I thought it resembled E.T. Aethiocarenus burmanicus probably lived in fissures in the bark of trees, looking for mites, worms or fungi to feed on while dinosaurs lumbered nearby. It was tiny, but scary looking. The insect, probably an omnivore, also had a long, narrow, flat body, and long slender legs. It could have moved quickly, and literally seen behind itself. It also had glands on the neck that secreted a deposit that Prof. Poinar and his colleague, Alex Brown, believe most likely was a chemical to repel predators. Aethiocarenus burmanicus has been assigned to the newly created order Aethiocarenodea. It appears to be unique in the insect world, and after considerable discussion we decided it had to take its place in a new order, Prof. Poinar explained.

The research is published in the Journal of Proteome Research. Collagen is a protein and peptides are the building blocks of proteins. Recovering peptides allows researchers to determine evolutionary relationships between dinosaurs and modern animals, as well as investigate other questions, such as which characteristics of collagen protein allow it to preserve over geological time. The team, led by North Carolina State University Professor Mary Schweitzer, wanted to confirm earlier findings of original dinosaur collagen first reported in 2009 from Brachylophosaurus canadensis. To test the hypothesis that peptides can be repeatedly detected and validated from fossil tissues many millions of years old, we apply updated extraction methodology, high resolution mass spectrometry, and bioinformatics analyses on a Brachylophosaurus canadensis specimen from which collagen I peptides were recovered in 2009, the authors explained. The sample material came from the specimens femur, or thigh bone. We recovered eight peptide sequences of collagen I, two of which are identical to peptides recovered in 2009, and six of which are new, they said. The sequences show that the collagen I in Brachylophosaurus canadensis has similarities with collagen I in both crocodylians and birds, a result we would expect for a hadrosaur, based on predictions made from previous skeletal studies. Phylogenetic analyses place the recovered sequences within basal archosauria and when only the new sequences are considered, Brachylophosaurus canadensis is grouped more closely to crocodylians, but when all sequences current and those reported in 2009 are analyzed, Brachylophosaurus canadensis is placed more closely to basal birds, Prof. Schweitzer and co authors said. The data robustly support the hypothesis of an endogenous origin for these peptides, confirm the idea that peptides can survive in specimens tens of millions of years old, and bolster the validity of the 2009 study. Furthermore, the new data expand the coverage of Brachylophosaurus canadensis collagen I a 33.6 increase in collagen I alpha 1 and 116.7 in alpha 2. We are confident that the results we obtained are not contamination and that this collagen is original to the specimen, added Dr. Elena Schroeter, lead author on the study and a researcher in the Department of Biological Sciences at North Carolina State University. Not only did we replicate part of the 2009 results, thanks to improved methods and technology we did it with a smaller sample and over a shorter period of time. Our purpose here is to build a solid scientific foundation for other scientists to use to ask larger questions of the fossil record, Prof. Schweitzer said. Weve shown that it is possible for these molecules to preserve. Now, we can ask questions that go beyond dinosaur characteristics. For example, other researchers in other disciplines may find that asking why they preserve is important.

The new otter species is based on a nearly complete cranium, mandible and partial skeletons of at least three individuals from the Shuitangba Water Pond Platform in Chinese fossil site in Yunnan Province, south western China. The ancient creature belongs to a little known genus of extinct otters called Siamogale, according to the paleontologists. This genus goes back at least 18 million years and was previously known only from a single species from Thailand, Siamogale thailandica. Named Siamogale melilutra, the new species weighed around 50 kg 110 lbs  almost twice as large as the largest living otters. While Siamogale melilutras cranium is incredibly complete, it was flattened during the fossilization process. The bones were so delicate that we could not physically restore the cranium, said team member Dr. Denise Su, from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Instead, we CT scanned the specimen and virtually reconstructed it in a computer. The CT restoration revealed a combination of otter like and badger like cranial and dental feature. Siamogale melilutra had a large and powerful jaw, with enlarged, bunodont rounded cusped cheek teeth, Dr. Su and co authors reported in the Journal of Systematic Paleontology. These characteristics appear to have been adaptations for eating large shellfish and freshwater mollusks, both of which were found in abundance at the Shuitangba site. From the vegetation and other animal groups found at Shuitangba, we know that it was a swampy, shallow lake with quite dense vegetation, Dr. Su. Multiple otter lineages have low crowned, bunodont teeth, leading us to ask the question if this was inherited from a common ancestor or if this was convergent evolution based on common dietary behaviors across different species, added team member Dr. Xiaoming Wang, from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that bunodont dentition independently appeared at least three times over the evolutionary history of otters. This discovery now has the paleontologists trying to understand other aspects of the life of Siamogale melilutra. The discovery of the otter helps solve some questions about otter relationships, but has opened the door to new questions, Dr. Wang said. For instance, why was it so large, how did it crack open mollusks and shellfish for food, and how did it move in the water and on land? Continued future studies by our group will address these fundamental questions and give us a more complete picture of its paleobiology, Dr. Su added. Xiaoming Wang et al.

A paper on the subject is published in the journal Nature Communications. The Australian collection of megafauna some 50,000 years ago included 1,000 pound kangaroos, 2 ton wombats, 25 foot long lizards, 400 pound flightless birds, 300 pound marsupial lions and Volkswagen sized tortoises, said University of Colorado Boulder Professor Gifford Miller, lead co author on the study. More than 85 of Australias mammals, birds and reptiles weighing over 100 pounds went extinct shortly after the arrival of the first humans. Whether humans were responsible for the demise of the Pleistocene megafauna across Australia has been debated for many years, said lead co author Dr. Sander van der Kaars, a researcher at Monash University, Australia. Our study found that the demise of the megafauna in southwest Australia took place from 45,000 to 43,100 years ago and was not linked to major changes in climate, vegetation or biomass burning but is consistent with extinction being driven by imperceptible overkill by humans. The researchers analyzed a continuous and precisely dated sediment core collected offshore southwest Australia that captures the last 150,000 years in high resolution. Environmental proxies preserved in the sediments track environmental change and the abundance of megafauna. We used information from a sediment core drilled in the Indian Ocean off the coast of southwest Australia to help reconstruct past climate and ecosystems on the continent, Prof. Miller explained. The sediment core contains chronological layers of material blown and washed into the ocean, including dust, pollen, ash and spores from a fungus called Sporormiella that thrived on the dung of plant eating mammals. The core allowed us to look back in time, in this case more than 150,000 years, spanning Earths last full glacial cycle. The team found that the major environmental shifts of the last glacial cycle had little impact on the abundance of megafauna, as recorded by Sporormiella, and megafaunal extinction commenced within 2,000 years of humans colonizing Australia and took less than 2,000 years to complete. We record high levels of the dung fungus Sporormiella, a proxy for herbivore biomass, from 150,000 to 45,000 years ago, then a marked decline indicating megafaunal population collapse, from 45,000 to 43,100 years ago, placing the extinctions within 4,000 years of human dispersal across Australia, the authors explained. These findings rule out climate change, and implicate humans, as the primary extinction cause. The results of this study are of significant interest across the archaeological and earth science communities, and to the general public who remain fascinated by the menagerie of now extinct giant animals that roamed the planet, and the cause of their extinction, as our own species began its persistent colonization of Earth, Dr. van der Kaars said. "}, {"title": " Hyoliths: Mysterious Cambrian Animals Classified as Lophophorates", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jan 12, 2017", "doc": "Paleontologists have finally determined what hyoliths  a group of extinct marine creatures  actually are. Hyoliths evolved over 530 million years ago during the Cambrian period and are among the first animals known to have produced mineralized external skeletons. Long believed to belong to the same family as snails, squid and other mollusks, a new study shows that hyoliths are instead more closely related to brachiopods  a group of animals which has a rich fossil record, although few living species remain today. Brachiopods have a soft body enclosed between upper and lower shells valves, unlike the left and right arrangement of valves in bivalve mollusks. Brachiopods open their valves at the front when feeding, but otherwise keep them closed to protect their feeding apparatus and other body parts. Although the skeletal remains of hyoliths are abundant in the fossil record, key diagnostic aspects of their soft anatomy remained critically absent until now. Hyoliths are abundant and globally distributed shelly fossils that appear early in the Cambrian period and can be found throughout the 280 million year span of Paleozoic strata, the studys authors said. The ecological and evolutionary importance of this group has remained unresolved, largely because of their poorly constrained soft anatomy and idiosyncratic scleritome. Joseph Moysiuk, an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto and corresponding co author on the study, said our most important and surprising discovery is the hyolith feeding structure, which is a row of flexible tentacles extending away from the mouth, contained within the cavity between the lower conical shell and upper cap like shell. Only one group of living animals  the brachiopods  has a comparable feeding structure enclosed by a pair of valves. This finding demonstrates that brachiopods, and not mollusks, are the closest surviving relatives of hyoliths. It suggests that these hyoliths fed on organic material suspended in water as living brachiopods do today, sweeping food into their mouths with their tentacles. All hyoliths had an elongated, bilaterally symmetrical cone shaped shell and a smaller cap like shell which covered the opening of the conical shell known as an operculum. Some species also bore a pair of rigid, curved spines known as helens that protruded from between the conical shell and operculum  structures with no equivalents in any other group of animals. Examination of the orientation of the helens in multiple hyolith specimens from the renowned Cambrian Burgess Shale suggests that these spines may have been used like stilts to lift the body of the animal above the sediment, elevating the feeding apparatus to enhance feeding. We examined over 1,500 specimens of the mid Cambrian hyolith Haplophrentis from the Burgess Shale and Spence Shale Lagerst\u00e4tten, they said. We reconstructed Haplophrentis as a semi sessile, epibenthic suspension feeder that could use its helens to elevate its tubular body above the sea floor. Exceptionally preserved soft tissues include an extendable, gullwing shaped, tentacle bearing organ surrounding a central mouth, which we interpret as a lophophore, and a U shaped digestive tract ending in a dorsolateral anus. Together with opposing bilateral sclerites and a deep ventral visceral cavity, these features indicate an affinity with the lophophorates brachiopods, phoronids and tommotiids, substantially increasing the morphological disparity of this prominent group. The Burgess Shale is one of the most important fossil deposits for studying the origin and early evolution of animals that took place during the Cambrian period, starting about 542 million years ago. Hyoliths are just one of the profusion of animal groups that characterize the fauna of the Cambrian explosion. They became a diverse component of marine ecosystems around the globe for more than 280 million years, only to go extinct 252 million years ago, prior to the evolution of the first dinosaurs. Resolving the debate over the hyoliths adds to our understanding of the Cambrian explosion, the period of rapid evolutionary development when most major animal groups emerge in the fossil record, said co author Dr. Martin Smith of Durham University, UK. Our study reiterates the importance of soft tissue preservation from Burgess Shale type deposits in illuminating the evolutionary history of creatures about which we still know very little. The findings were published online this week in the journal Nature.

The research appears today in the journal Nature. Chimaeras, or chimaeroid fishes subclass Holocephali, include 47 living species, known in various parts of the world as ratfish, rabbit fish, ghost sharks, St. Joseph sharks or elephant sharks. They represent one of four fundamental divisions of modern gnathostomes jawed vertebrates. With large eyes and tooth plates adapted for grinding prey, these deep water dwelling fish are far from the killer sharks of Hollywood. Their anatomy comprises features reminiscent of sharks, ray finned fishes and tetrapods, and their form is shaped by hardened bits of cartilage rather than bone. Because chimaeras are found in deep water, they were long considered rare. But as marine biologists gained the technology to explore more of the ocean, they are now known to be widespread, but their numbers remain uncertain. Chimaeroids belong somewhere close to the sharks and rays, but theres always been uncertainty when you search deeper in time for their evolutionary branching point, said lead author Prof. Michael Coates, from the University of Chicago. Chimaeras are unusual throughout the long span of their fossil record. Because of this, its been difficult to understand how they got to be the way they are in the first place. Our discovery sheds new light not only on the early evolution of shark like fishes, but also on jawed vertebrates as a whole. After a 2014 study detailing their extremely slow evolving genomes was published in the journal Nature, interest in chimaeras blossomed. Of all living vertebrates with jaws, chimaeras seemed to offer the best promise of finding an archive of information about conditions close to the last common ancestor of Homo and the great white shark. Like sharks, also reliant on cartilage, chimaeras rarely fossilize. The few known early chimaera fossils closely resemble their living descendants. Until now, the chimaeroid evolutionary record consisted mostly of isolated specimens of their characteristic hyper mineralized tooth plates. The Dwykaselachus oosthuizeni fossil resolves this issue. It was originally discovered by amateur paleontologist Roy Oosthuizen when he split open a nodule of rock on his farm in South Africa in the 1980s. An initial description named it based on material visible at the broken surface of the nodule. In 2013, co author Dr. Robert Gess, a researcher in the Geology Department and Albany Museum at Rhodes University in South Africa, CT scanned the Dwykaselachus skull. At the surface, the specimen appeared to be a symmoriid shark, a group of 300 million year old sharks, known for their unusual dorsal fin spines, some resembling boom like prongs and others surreal ironing boards. CT scans showed that the skull was remarkably intact, one of a very few that had not been crushed during fossilization. The scans also provide an unprecedented view of the interior of the brain case. When I saw it for the first time, I was stunned. The specimen is remarkable, Prof. Coates said. The images show a series of telltale anatomical structures that mark the specimen as an early chimaera, not a shark. The braincase preserves details about the brain shape, the paths of major cranial nerves and the anatomy of the inner ear. All of which indicate that Dwykaselachus oosthuizeni belongs to modern day chimaeras. The scans reveal clues about how these fish began to diverge from their common ancestry with sharks. A large extinction of vertebrates at the end of the Devonian period, about 360 million years ago, gave rise to an explosion of cartilaginous fishes, Prof. Coates said. Instead of what became modern day sharks, revelations from the study indicate that much of this new biodiversity was, instead, early chimaeras. We can now say that the first radiation of cartilaginous fishes after the end Devonian extinction was chimaeras, in abundance. Its the inverse of what weve got today, where sharks are far more common.  Michael I. Coates et al. A symmoriiform chondrichthyan braincase and the origin of chimaeroid fishes.

Some of the greatest riddles about dinosaurs pertain to their embryology  virtually nothing is known, said Prof. Gregory Erickson, a researcher at Florida State University and lead author on the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Did their eggs incubate slowly like their reptilian cousins  crocodilians and lizards? Or rapidly like living dinosaurs  the birds? We know very little about dinosaur embryology, yet it relates to so many aspects of development, life history, and evolution, said Dr. Mark Norell, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History and co author on the study. But with the help of advanced tools like CT scanners and high resolution microscopy, were making discoveries that we couldnt have imagined two decades ago. This work is a great example of how new technology and new ideas can be brought to old problems. Paleontologists had long theorized that dinosaur incubation duration was similar to birds, whose eggs hatch in periods ranging from 11 85 days. Comparable sized reptilian eggs typically take twice as long  weeks to many months. Because dinosaur eggs were large, researchers believed they must have experienced rapid incubation with birds inheriting that characteristic from their dinosaur ancestors. Prof. Erickson, Dr. Norell and their colleagues decided to put these theories to the test. To do that, the paleontologists accessed some rare fossils  those of dinosaur embryos. They looked at the fossilized teeth of two well preserved embryos of ornithischian dinosaurs i Protoceratops, a pig sized dinosaur found by the team in the Mongolian Gobi Desert, whose eggs were quite small at 194 grams and ii Hypacrosaurus, a very large duck billed dinosaur found in Alberta, Canada, with eggs weighing more than 4 kg. First, the authors scanned the embryonic jaws of the two dinosaurs with CT to visualize the forming dentitions. Then they used an advanced microscope to look for and analyze the pattern of von Ebner lines  growth lines that are present in the teeth of all animals, humans included. This work marks the first time that these growth lines have been identified in dinosaur embryos. These are the lines that are laid down when any animals teeth develops. Theyre kind of like tree rings, but theyre put down daily. And so we could literally count them to see how long each dinosaur had been developing, Prof. Erickson explained. Using this method, the team determined that the Protoceratops embryos were about three months old when they died and the Hypacrosaurus embryos were about six months old. This places non avian dinosaur incubation more in line with that of their reptilian cousins, whose eggs typically take twice as long as bird eggs to hatch  weeks to many months. The study implies that birds likely evolved more rapid incubation rates after they branched off from the rest of the dinosaurs. The results might be quite different if they were able to analyze a more bird like dinosaur, like Velociraptor. But unfortunately, very few fossilized dinosaur embryos have been discovered, the researchers said. The biggest ramification from the study, however, relates to the extinction of dinosaurs. Given that these creatures required considerable resources to reach adult size, took more than a year to mature and had slow incubation times, they would have been at a distinct disadvantage compared to other animals that survived the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event. We suspect our findings have implications for understanding why dinosaurs went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, whereas amphibians, birds, mammals and other reptiles made it through and prospered, Prof. Erickson said.

Limusaurus inextricabilis mire lizard who could not escape is a ceratosaurian theropod dinosaur that lived during the Upper Jurassic Oxfordian in what is now northwestern China. It was found in 159 million year old deposits located in the Junggar Basin of Xinjiang and earned its name from the way its skeletons were preserved, stacked on top of each other in fossilized mire pits. The research team, led by Dr. Xing Xu from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing and Dr. Shuo Wang of Capital Normal University in Beijing, studied 19 skeletons of Limusaurus inextricabilis. The individuals ranged in age from baby to adult, showing the pattern of tooth loss over time. The baby skeleton had small, sharp teeth, and the adult skeletons were consistently toothless. We analyzed 19 specimens of Limusaurus inextricabilis, representing six ontogenetic stages based on body size and histological data, the authors explained. Among 78 ontogenetic changes we identified in these specimens, the most unexpected one is the change from fully toothed jaws in the hatchling and juvenile individuals to a completely toothless beaked jaw in the more mature individuals, representing the first fossil record of ontogenetic edentulism among the jawed vertebrates. This discovery is important for two reasons, said co author Prof. James Clark, from the George Washington Universitys Columbian College of Arts and Sciences. First, its very rare to find a growth series from baby to adult dinosaurs. Second, this unusually dramatic change in anatomy suggests there was a big shift in Limusaurus diet from adolescence to adulthood. For most dinosaur species we have few specimens and a very incomplete understanding of their developmental biology, said co author Josef Stiegler, a graduate student at George Washington University. The large sample size of Limusaurus inextricabilis allowed us to use several lines of evidence including the morphology, microstructure and stable isotopic composition of the fossil bones to understand developmental and dietary changes in this animal. Limusaurus inextricabilis is part of the theropod group of dinosaurs, the evolutionary ancestors of birds. The teams earlier research of Limusaurus inextricabilis described the species hand development and notes that the dinosaurs reduced first finger may have been transitional and that later theropods lost the first and fifth fingers. Similarly, bird hands consist of the equivalent of a humans second, third and fourth fingers. The fossils indicate that baby Limusaurus inextricabilis could have been carnivores or omnivores while the adults were herbivores, as they would have needed teeth to chew meat but not plants. The fossils also could help to show how theropods such as birds lost their teeth, initially through changes during their development from babies to adults. Tooth loss isnt so unusual in animals alive today. There are fish and an amphibian that lose teeth as they grow. Platypuses lose their teeth too, Dr. Wang said. But the discovery is still a first for the fossil record and for reptiles. The teams findings, published in the journal Current Biology, suggest that the dietary habits and needs of some dinosaurs changed over the course of their development, most likely along with shifts in their digestive systems.

The team, led by University of Rochester Professor John Tarduno, has identified the well preserved specimen as a new genus and species, which has been named Tingmiatornis arctica. The genus name is from Tingmiat, which in Inuktitut references those that fly. The species name makes reference to the high Arctic provenance of the holotype and referred material, the researchers explained. Tingmiatornis arctica would have been a cross between a large seagull and a diving bird like a cormorant, but likely had teeth, Prof. Tarduno said. The teams findings, published in the journal Scientific Reports, add to previous fossil records the authors uncovered from the same geological time period and location in previous expeditions. Taken together, these fossils paint a clearer picture of an ecosystem that would have existed in the Canadian Arctic during the Cretaceous periods Turonian age, which lasted from 93.9 to 89.8 million years ago. Before our fossil, people were suggesting that it was warm, but you still would have had seasonal ice, Prof. Tarduno said. Were suggesting thats not even the case, and that its one of these hyper warm intervals because the birds food sources and the whole part of the ecosystem could not have survived in ice. From the fossil and sediment records, Prof. Tarduno and co authors were able to conjecture that Tingmiatornis arcticas environment in the Canadian Arctic would have been characterized by volcanic activity, a calm freshwater bay, temperatures comparable to those in northern Florida today, and creatures such as turtles, large freshwater fish, and champsosaurs. The fossils tell us what that world could look like, a world without ice at the Arctic. It would have looked very different than today where you have tundra and fewer animals, said co author Richard Bono, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Rochester. The Tingmiatornis arctica fossils were found above basalt lava fields, created from a series of volcanic eruptions. Researchers believe volcanoes pumped carbon dioxide into the Earths atmosphere, causing a greenhouse effect and a period of extraordinary polar heat. This created an ecosystem allowing large birds, including Tingmiatornis arctica, to thrive. Prof. Tarduno and his colleagues unearthed three bird bones part of the ulna and portions of the humerus, which, in birds, are located in the wings. From the bone features, as well as its thickness and proportions, they were able to determine the evolutionary relationships of Tingmiatornis arctica as well as characteristics that indicate whether it likely was able to fly or dive. Fossils of Tingmiatornis arctica, while well preserved, are few in number thus limiting inferences about the anatomy and ecology of this species. From the bone cortex thickness and proportions of the humerus, Tingmiatornis appears to be volant and likely a diving taxon like Pasquaornis, the authors explained. Previous fossil discoveries indicate the presence of carnivorous fish such as the 0.3 0.6 m long bowfin. Birds feeding on these fish would need to be larger sized and have teeth, offering additional clues to Tingmiatornis arcticas characteristics. Based on complete skeletons of the bowfin, Amia calva, as a most conservative estimate, the amiid fish known at the Arctic locality would be roughly 0.3 0.6 m long. This suggests these fish may have been able to out compete birds below the size of Tingmiatornis arctica, if, as we propose, Tingmiatornis arctica was a diving bird potentially feeding on the fish documented in the Axel Heiberg fossil assemblage, Prof. Tarduno and co authors said. That Tingmiatornis arctica foraged at night also cannot be excluded considering that one potential modern analogue, the western grebe Aechmophorus occidentalis, is known to nocturnally forage while in its wintering habitats. If Tingmiatornis arctica lived in the Arctic during the winter months, it would have experienced prolonged periods of twilight in addition to approximately 2 months of total darkness each year. "}, {"title": " Feathered Dinosaur Tail Found Encased in Mid-Cretaceous Burmese Amber", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Dec 9, 2016", "doc": "An international team of paleontologists from China, Canada and the United Kingdom has discovered the tail of a non avian theropod dinosaur likely a coelurosaur trapped in a piece of 99 million year old Burmese amber. This remarkable specimen was bought at an amber market in Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin state in northern Myanmar, in 2015. While this isnt the first time feathers have been found in amber, earlier specimens have been difficult to link to their source animal. Amber pieces preserve tiny snapshots of ancient ecosystems, but they record microscopic details, three dimensional arrangements, and labile tissues that are difficult to study in other settings, said Dr. Ryan McKellar, adjunct professor at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Canada, and co lead author of a paper describing the discovery in the journal Current Biology. This is a new source of information that is worth researching with intensity and protecting as a fossil resource. The new material preserves a tail consisting of 8 vertebrae from a juvenile. These are surrounded by feathers that are preserved in 3D and with microscopic detail, Dr. McKellar added. We can be sure of the source because the vertebrae are not fused into a rod or pygostyle as in modern birds and their closest relatives. Instead, the tail is long and flexible, with keels of feathers running down each side. In other words, the feathers definitely are those of a dinosaur not a prehistoric bird. According to the team, the specimen represents the feathered tail of a juvenile coelurosaur. While it was initially difficult to make out the details of the amber inclusion, Dr. McKellar and co authors relied on CT scanning and microscopic observations to get a closer look. The tail is visible to the naked eye as an elongate and gently curved structure length  3.7 cm, the researchers said. A dense covering of feathers protrudes from the tail, obscuring underlying details, so CT scanning was employed to examine concealed osteological and soft tissue features. The feathers suggest that the tail had a chestnut brown upper surface and a pale or white underside. The specimen also offers insight into feather evolution. The feathers lack a well developed central shaft or rachis. Their structure suggests that the two finest tiers of branching in modern feathers, known as barbs and barbules, arose before a rachis formed. Dr. McKellar and his colleagues also examined the chemistry of the tail inclusion where it was exposed at the surface of the amber. The analysis shows that the soft tissue layer around the bones retained traces of ferrous iron, a relic left over from hemoglobin that was also trapped in the sample. Soft tissues  presumably muscles, ligaments, and skin  are visible sporadically through the plumage, clinging to the bones in a manner suggestive of the desiccation common to other vertebrate remains in amber, the authors explained. These tissues have largely been reduced to a carbon film, retaining only traces of their original chemical composition. Our calculations indicate that more than 80 of iron in the sample is ferrous Fe2+. Similar measurements have been made on vessels preserved within Tyrannosaurus and Brachylophosaurus bones and have been interpreted as indicating the presence of goethite and biogenic iron oxides produced from hemoglobin decomposition. The researchers are now eager to see how additional finds from this region will reshape our understanding of plumage and soft tissues in dinosaurs and other vertebrates.

Research describing the new species is published online in the journal ZooKeys. The fossils come from the Oliver Bluffs on the Beardmore Glacier which is a major outlet glacier of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, said the authors, Dr. Allan Ashworth of North Dakota State University and Dr. Terry Erwin of Smithsonian Institution. The site is within the Transantarctic Mountains about 342 miles 550 km from the South Pole. The scientists named the new species Antarctotrechus balli and gave it the common name Balls Antarctic tundra beetle. The insect fauna in Antarctica is so poor that today it consists of only three species of flightless midges, with one of them having been probably introduced from the subantarctic island of South Georgia, they said. The absence of biodiversity is considered to be a result of lack of moisture, vegetation and low temperatures. Antarctotrechus balli must have inhabited the sparsely vegetated sand and gravel banks of a meltwater fed stream that was once part of an outwash plain at the head of a fjord in the Transantarctic Mountains. Plants associated with this species include southern beech, buttercup, moss mats, and cushion plants, all typical for a tundra ecosystem. The extinct beetle may or may not have been able to fly. The age of the fossils is probably Early to Mid Miocene 14 20 million years ago, Dr. Ashworth and Dr. Erwin said. The tundra biome, including Antarctotrechus balli, became extinct in the interior of Antarctica about 14 million years ago and on the margins of the continent by 10 13 million years ago. According to the team, Antarctotrechus balli is the second beetle for the Antarctic insect fauna with living descendants. The closest modern relatives to the species live in South America, the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, Tasmania and Australia. Tracking the ancient lineage of this group of beetles, known as the carabid beetle tribe Trechini, confirms that they were once widely distributed in Gondwana, the supercontinent that used to unite what today we recognize as Antarctica, South America, Africa, Madagascar, Australia, the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian Subcontinent. Antarctotrechus balli is also evidence that even after Gondwana broke apart, the tundra ecosystem persevered in Antarctica for millions of years. "}, {"title": " Ancient Melanosomes, Beta-Keratin Found in Fossilized Feathers of Early Cretaceous Bird", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Nov 25, 2016", "doc": "An international team of paleontologists has found evidence of beta keratin and melanosome preservation in a 130 million year old specimen of the Early Cretaceous bird Eoconfuciusornis. Eoconfuciusornis, a genus of crow sized primitive birds from the Early Cretaceous Dabeigou and Huajiying Formations of China, dating from 135 to 125 million years ago, are the earliest birds to have a keratinous beak and no teeth, like modern birds. Previous studies argued that the feathers of these and other early birds and dinosaurs preserved small, round structures interpreted to be melanosomes  pigment containing organelles that, along with other pigments, give feathers their color. However, without additional evidence, it was not possible to prove that these structures werent just ancient bacteria that had coated the feather during decomposition and fossilization. Microbodies associated with feathers of both non avian dinosaurs and early birds were first identified as bacteria but have been reinterpreted as melanosomes, the authors said. Whereas melanosomes in modern feathers are always surrounded by and embedded in keratin, melanosomes embedded in keratin in fossils has not been demonstrated. We provide multiple independent molecular analyses of both microbodies and the associated matrix recovered from feathers of a new specimen of the basal bird Eoconfuciusornis from the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota of China. The team, led by Dr. Yanhong Pan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, examined feathers from the 130 million year old Eoconfuciusornis specimen. The researchers used both scanning and transmission electron microscopy to get microscopic details of the feathers surface and their internal structure. They also utilized immunogold labeling  in which gold particles are attached to antibodies that bind to particular proteins in order to make them visible in electron microscopy  to show that filaments within the feathers were keratin. Finally, the team mapped copper and sulfur to these feathers at high resolution. Sulfur was broadly distributed, reflecting its presence in both keratin and melanin molecules in modern feathers. However copper, which is only found in modern melanosomes, and not part of keratin, was only observed in the fossil melanosomes. These findings both support the identity of the melanosomes and indicate that there was no mixing or leaching during decomposition and fossilization. This study is the first to demonstrate evidence for both keratin and melanosomes, using structural, chemical and molecular methods, Dr. Pan said. These methods have the potential to help us understand  on the molecular level  how and why feathers evolved in these lineages. This study represents a breakthrough in the study of ultrastructures of fossil feathers and has provided the methods to apply to the controversial issue of whether the microbodies in many feathered dinosaurs and early birds are really melanosomes, and sheds new light on molecular preservation within normally labile tissues preserved in ancient fossils, added team member Prof. Zhonghe Zhou, from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, China. The findings were published online this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "}, {"title": " Dinosaur-Era Bird Had Iridescent Feathers", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Nov 16, 2016", "doc": "A group of paleontologists led by University of Akron researcher Jennifer Peteya has discovered a new bohaiornithid bird specimen from the Cretaceous period of China with remarkably preserved feathers. Bohaiornithid birds belonged to Enantiornithes, a diverse group of birds that lived during the time of the dinosaurs. Our current knowledge of prehistoric plumage is limited, but the new findings provide valuable insights related to structure and coloration. Many enantiornithine birds possessed ornate feathers, said Peteya, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Biology and Integrated Bioscience Program at the University of Akron. This new specimen shows that some enantiornithines also had iridescent feathers and unlike most modern birds, these flashy ornaments developed before the animal was fully grown. The specimen was collected from the Jiufotang Formation near Lamadong Village in Liaoning Province, China. It consists of a nearly complete skeleton with preserved melanized feathers. A white halo surrounds and intermingles with skeletal elements and obscures the proximal ends of feathers, Peteya and co authors noted. A similar halo has previously been described in Microraptor sp. and was suggested to be the result of changes in matrix chemistry due to water being trapped between the feathers and the body. With a mixture of juvenile and subadult skeletal characteristics, the new bohaiornithid specimen preserves feather morphologies indicative of sexual maturity. Exceptionally preserved feathers cover the body, including elongate crown feathers, body contour feathers, asymmetrically veined wing primaries, an alula and two elongate rachis dominated rectrices that may have been sexual ornaments, the authors said. The crown, neck, and body contour feathers retain elongate melanosome morphologies associated with weakly iridescent coloration in extant feathers. The new specimen presents a combination of juvenile skeletal features and display linked plumage characteristics that inform the role of sexual selection in Enantiornithes, they added. Currently, there is comparatively little evidence available for ontogenetic shifts in morphology within Bohaiornithidae and the new specimen is the smallest and possibly the youngest bohaiornithid yet described. The teams findings were published online this week in the journal Palaentology.

The team, led by Dr. Junchang L\u00fc, a paleontologist with the Institute of Geology in Beijing, China, has named the new dinosaur species Tongtianlong limosus, meaning muddy dragon on the road to heaven. The ancient creature belongs to a family of feathered dinosaurs called oviraptorosaurs Oviraptorosauria, characterized by having short, toothless heads and sharp beaks. Some, including the newly discovered Tongtianlong limosus, had crests of bone on their heads that were probably used as display structures to attract mates and intimidate rivals, like modern day cassowaries. Tongtianlong limosus is a derived oviraptorid oviraptorosaur, differentiated from other species by its unique dome like skull roof, highly convex premaxilla, and other features of the skull, Dr. L\u00fc and co authors said. A nearly complete, three dimensionally preserved skeleton of Tongtianlong limosus, including a skull and lower jaws, was collected from the Nanxiong Formation in the Ganzhou area of Jiangxi Province, southern China. It was preserved almost intact, lying on its front with its wings and neck outstretched. Dr. L\u00fc and his colleagues speculate that the animal may have died in this pose after becoming mired in mud 66 72 million years ago. This new dinosaur is one of the most beautiful, but saddest, fossils Ive ever seen, said team member Dr. Steve Brusatte, of the University of Edinburgh. But were lucky that the Mud Dragon got stuck in the muck, because its skeleton is one of the best examples of a dinosaur that was flourishing during those final few million years before the asteroid came down and changed the world in an instant. According to the team, Tongtianlong limosus is the sixth species of oviraptorosaur named from the Nanxiong Formation. All of these have been described over the past five years, and include Banji, Ganzhousaurus, Jiangxisaurus, Nankangia, and Huanansaurus. The discovery of the new oviraptorid dinosaur further indicates that the Ganzhou area of Southern China is a most productive locality of oviraptorid dinosaurs and has a huge diversity of oviraptorosaurs from the late Cretaceous, Dr. L\u00fc said. It will provide important information on the study of evolution, distribution and behavior of oviraptorid dinosaurs. The newly discovered dinosaur was announced today in the journal Scientific Reports.

Oncorhynchus rastrosus, also known as giant, tusk toothed salmon, lived along the Pacific coast of North America California, Oregon, and Washington roughly 11 to 5 million years ago. This ancient fish was large, approximately 3 9 feet 1 3 m long and nearly 400 pounds 177 kg in weight, much larger than the typical salmon found in the Pacific today. The species migrated from the Pacific Ocean to inland rivers to spawn, as salmon do today. And it was planktivorous, based on numerous gill rakers, and a few, small teeth. Oncorhynchus rastrosus also had two, large 0.8 1.2 inches, or 2 3 cm, long, upper tusk shaped teeth. A great deal is known about Oncorhynchus rastrosus from previous studies. However, there are still gaps in our knowledge about this fascinating giant salmon, Dr. Sankey and co authors said. To see if the tusk shaped teeth played an important role in breeding of this species, the researchers compared 51 different fossils from ancient deposits of both freshwater and saltwater environments. Teeth from freshwater deposits are not only larger, but they are also more recurved, and the tooth tips more worn and blunt. In addition, their bony tooth bases are considerably larger, they said. Teeth from coastal marine deposits are smaller, straighter, their tooth tips sharper, and their tooth bases smaller. This supports our hypothesis that Oncorhynchus rastrosus did developmentally change between the marine and freshwater stages of their lives, as modern salmon do today. The paleontologists think it is likely Oncorhynchus rastrosus were using their tusk shaped teeth for fighting and display against each other during the spawning season, up in the ancient rivers of California. These giant, spike toothed salmon were amazing fish. You can picture them getting scooped out of the Proto Tuolumne River  near Modesto, California  by large bears 5 million years ago, Dr. Sankey said.

The fossil, studied by an international team of paleontologists led by Prof. Martin Brasier of the University of Oxford, displays distinct similarities to the brains of modern day descendants of dinosaurs, namely birds and crocodiles. The chances of preserving brain tissue are incredibly small, so the discovery of this specimen is astonishing, said co author Dr. Alex Liu, from the Universities of Cambridge and Bristol. The fossilized brain is most likely from a species similar to Iguanodon, a large plant eating dinosaur that lived in what is now Europe between 135 and 120 million years ago Lower Cretaceous period. Scanning electron microscopy revealed detailed structures, interpreted as meningeal fabrics, blood vessels including capillaries and potentially superficial cortical tissues, which have been replaced by calcium phosphate or molded by microcrystalline iron carbonate, the paleontologists explained. The organism from which this endocast originates has been referred to informally as Iguanodon. Two Iguanodon like taxa are now recognized from the Lower Wealden outcrops of Valanginian age Barilium dawsoni and Hypselospinus fittoni. The dimensions of the new specimen indicate that it came from an individual with a body length of 13 16 feet 4 5 m and could therefore originate from either Barilium up to 26 feet, or 8 m, long or Hypselospinus up to 20 feet, or 6 m, long. According to the team, the reason this piece of brain tissue has been so well preserved is that the dinosaurs brain was essentially pickled in a highly acidic and low oxygen body of water shortly after its death. This allowed the soft tissues to become mineralized before they decayed away completely, so that they could be preserved. What we think happened is that this particular dinosaur died in or near a body of water, and its head ended up partially buried in the sediment at the bottom, said co author Dr. David Norman, from the University of Cambridge. Since the water had little oxygen and was very acidic, the soft tissues of the brain were likely preserved and cast before the rest of its body was buried in the sediment. In typical reptiles, the brain has the shape of a sausage, surrounded by a dense region of blood vessels and thin walled vascular chambers sinuses that serve as a blood drainage system. The brain itself only takes up about half of the space within the cranial cavity. In contrast, the tissue in the fossilized brain appears to have been pressed directly against the skull, raising the possibility that some dinosaurs had large brains which filled much more of the cranial cavity. However, the team cautions against drawing any conclusions about the intelligence of dinosaurs from this particular fossil, and says that it is most likely that during death and burial the head of this dinosaur became overturned, so that as the brain decayed, gravity caused it to collapse and become pressed against the bony roof of the cavity. The results are reported in a Special Publication of the Geological Society of London, published in tribute to Prof. Brasier, who died in 2014. "}, {"title": " Avimimus Dinosaurs were Gregarious, Social Creatures, Paleontologists Say", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Oct 25, 2016", "doc": "Dozens of fossils from a bird like theropod dinosaur known as Avimimus have been unearthed in a single bonebed in Mongolia, providing strong evidence that they were gregarious, social beings. The common mythology of dinosaurs depicts solitary, vicious monsters running around eating everything, said Gregory Funston, a paleontologist at the University of Alberta, Canada. Our discovery demonstrates that dinosaurs are more similar to modern animals than people appreciate. The discovery comes from a site at the Nemegt locality in Mongolia, first encountered by researchers in 2006. Bonebeds provide good evidence that the animals were living together in colonies. Though rare in the Jurassic and Triassic, they dominate the Cretaceous period. However, this is the first discovery of a bonebed of bird like dinosaurs. A monodominant bonebed of Avimimus from the Nemegt Formation of Mongolia is the first oviraptorosaur bonebed described and the only recorded maniraptoran bonebed from the Late Cretaceous, Funston and co authors said. Evidence from other bonebeds suggests that non bird theropod dinosaurs had a tendency to form juvenile dominated herds. Adult dominated bonebeds of non theropod species also typically contain a small percentage of juvenile individuals. The Avimimus bonebed is therefore unusual in its near absence of juveniles, they said. The presence of more than two adults suggests that the bonebed is not an isolated family group, and the mix of subadults and adults in such a large aggregation argues against an assemblage of parents and their offspring. Although speculative, the paucity of juveniles in the bonebed may instead indicate that Avimimus formed age segregated assemblages, the scientists said. These groups may have enjoyed reproductive, antipredator, or foraging benefits, but the contribution of these factors to the formation of the assemblages is unclear. Lekking behavior, where individuals group to display to potential mates, is known in multiple groups, especially birds. Aggregations may include as many as 100 individuals of varying age, size, and sexual fitness. The near absence of juveniles is consistent with, but not indicative of, a lekking assemblage. Alternatively, the Avimimus bonebed may be evidence of flocking or communal roosting behavior. With an assemblage like this, you cant really understand why the dinosaurs died together unless you see the field site, Funston said. We can tell that they were living together around the time of death, but the mystery still remains as to why. The bonebed also produced skull elements that were formerly unknown for Avimimus and provide important anatomical information. The paleontologists report their findings in the journal Scientific Reports.

It had a long neck, a relatively short tail, very wide hips and widely spaced, stocky limbs with five toes on each foot. With hips at least 3 feet 1 m wide and a huge barrel like ribcage, Savannasaurus elliottorum is the most rotund sauropod we have found so far, said Dr. Stephen Poropat, from Uppsala University in Sweden and the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum in Queensland, Australia, who along with colleagues describes the dinosaur in the Oct. 20 issue of the journal Scientific Reports. It lived alongside at least two other types of sauropod, Diamantinasaurus and Wintonotitan, as well as other dinosaurs including ornithopods, armored ankylosaurs, and the carnivorous theropod Australovenator. Savannasaurus elliottorum was unearthed in 2005 by David Elliott, co founder of the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum. The disarticulated skeleton was found within a single siltstone concretion in the Winton Formation, a geological deposit approximately 95 million years old. After almost 10 years of painstaking work, the hard concretion around the bones was finally removed to reveal one of the most complete Cretaceous sauropod skeletons ever found in Australia. More excitingly, the remains belonged to a new genus and species of dinosaur. Around 95 million years ago, at the time that Savannasaurus elliottorum was alive, global average temperatures were warmer than they are today. However, it was quite cool at the poles at certain times, which seems to have restricted the movement of sauropods at polar latitudes. The paleontologists suspect that Savannasaurus elliottorums ancestor was from South America, but that it could not and did not enter Australia until 105 million years ago. At this time global average temperatures increased allowing sauropods to traverse landmasses at polar latitudes. This pattern of climate controlled distribution was actually evident in other animals and plants that lived at the same time as Savannasaurus elliottorum during the mid Cretaceous in Australia, said co author Dr. Benjamin Kear, from Uppsala University. However, our analysis provides the first compelling evidence that giant herbivorous dinosaurs were subject to these same environmental constraints, and that this signature of periodic trans polar migration was likely a broader characteristic of Australian faunas and floras from that time.

Jaws are an iconic and defining feature, not only of our own anatomy but of all jawed vertebrates. Jaws first appear in the developing embryo as a cartilage bar similar to a gill arch. In a shark, this develops directly into the adult jaws, but in an embryo of a bony fish, or a human being, new bones appear on the outside of the cartilage. In human skull, these bones  the dentary, maxilla and premaxilla  make up the entire jaws and carry our teeth. It is widely accepted that the dentary, maxilla and premaxilla are a shared heritage of bony fishes and tetrapods. But what about further back? Only one other group of fishes, placoderms, has a similar set of jaw bones. But these bones, known as gnathal plates, have always been regarded as unrelated to the dentary, maxilla and premaxilla. For one thing they are located slightly further inside the mouth, and in any case the general opinion has been that placoderms and bony fishes are only very distantly related. In 2013, Dr. Min Zhu of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in China and co authors unveiled a fossil, Entelognathus primordialis, that had a placoderm like body but a three part jaw. However, there was some uncertainty as to whether it could, indeed, be classified as a placoderm. Now, the same team has unearthed a new species, named Qilinyu rostrata, from the Kuanti Formation of Qujing in Yunnan, China. The preserved part of the fossil is 5 inches 12.6 cm long, with an estimated total body length of more than 8 inches 20 cm. Sporting a dolphin shaped head, Qilinyu appears to have dwelled and fed along the bottom of bodies of water. A comparison of this ancient fish to 372 other species consistently placed it as a sister group of Entelognathus. Whats more, Qilinyus jaw reveals the basis of a three part complex, confirming that such a setup evolved from within the placoderm system, and did not arise independently of placoderms. Looking at the jaw bones of Entelognathus and Qilinyu we can see that they, in both fishes, combine characters of the bony fish jaw bones and placoderm gnathal plates, Dr. Zhu and co authors said. Another thing becomes apparent as well it has been argued that placoderm gnathal plates represent an inner jaw arcade, similar in position to the coronoid bones of bony fishes, and if that were true we would expect to find gnathal plates just inside of the dentary, maxilla and premaxilla of Entelognathus and Qilinyu. But there is nothing there. The simplest interpretation of the observed pattern is that our own jaw bones are the old gnathal plates of placoderms, lightly remodeled. It seems like substantial parts of human anatomy can be traced back, not only to the earliest bony fishes, but beyond them to the strange ungainly armored placoderms of the Silurian period. The paper describing Qilinyu was published in the October 21, 2016 issue of the journal Science.

The unlucky tiny wasp was trapped in tree resin, which eventually fossilized into amber, about 100 million years ago, according to the study, published in the journal Cretaceous Research. The piece of amber was found in the Hukawng Valley in Myanmar, where arthropods from 252 families have been found, one of the richest such deposits in all Cretaceous amber. When I first looked at this insect I had no idea what it was. You could see its tough and robust, and could give a painful sting, said study co author Prof. George Poinar, Jr., of Oregon State University. The now extinct insect, named Aptenoperissus burmanicus, probably crawled along the ground at the base of trees trying to find other insects and a place to lay its eggs. While dinosaurs strolled around above it, it looked for an insect grub of some kind it could sting. After considerable debate, the study authors created a new family for the specimen, Aptenoperissidae, as part of the much larger order Hymenoptera ants, bees and wasps. Within that family, Aptenoperissus burmanicus is now the only known specimen. If you focused on its strong hind legs you could call it a grasshopper. The antenna looked like an ant, the thick abdomen more like a cockroach, Prof. Poinar said. But the face looked mostly like a wasp, and we finally decided it had to be some kind of Hymenoptera. The specimen is a female, and its long legs may have helped it pull out of cavities into which it had burrowed, seeking pupae of other insects into which to lay its eggs. With that lifestyle, wings would have been a hindrance. Aptenoperissus burmanicus may have attacked other beetles with its sharp and jagged stinger, and it would have had a pretty strong leaping ability. It did have a cleaning mechanism on the tip of its antenna that is characteristic of Hymenoptera.

This discovery and the apparent absence of syrinx in non avian dinosaur fossils of the same age indicate that the organ may have originated late in the evolution of birds and that other dinosaurs may not have been able to make noises similar to the bird calls we hear today. This finding helps explain why no such organ has been preserved in a non avian dinosaur or crocodile relative, said lead author Dr. Julia Clarke, from the Jackson School of Geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin. This is another important step to figuring out what dinosaurs sounded like as well as giving us insight into the evolution of birds. The fossilized syrinx was found in a specimen of Vegavis iaai, an extinct species of bird that lived between 68 and 66 million years ago. It was unearthed more than two decades ago on Vega Island, Antarctica. However, it wasnt until 2013 that Dr. Clarke noticed that the fossil included a syrinx. The asymmetrical shape of the syrinx indicates that Vegavis iaai could have made honking noises via two sound sources in the right and left parts of the organ. Dr. Clarke and co authors also scanned syrinxes of other birds to compare with the Vegavis syrinx. This included 12 syrinxes from living birds and the next oldest fossilized syrinx, which had not yet been studied. Here, we begin to outline how fossilizable characteristics of the syrinx may inform us about sound features, but we need a lot more data on living birds, said co author Dr. Franz Goller, from the University of Utah. Remarkably, prior to this work, there is almost no discussion of these important questions. The evolution of vocal behavior can give insights into other anatomical features, such as the appearance of bigger brains, Dr. Clarke added. This study follows research that Dr. Clarke and her colleagues published earlier this year that found some dinosaurs would likely have made closed mouth vocalizations akin to ostrich booms that dont require a syrinx. Together, the two studies have major implications for dinosaur sound making throughout time, Dr. Clarke said. The origin of birds is about so much more than the evolution of flight and feathers, she added. The discovery is reported Oct. 12 in the online edition of the journal Nature. "}, {"title": " 54-Million-Year-Old Biting Midge Found Preserved in Amber", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Oct 6, 2016", "doc": "A fossilized biting midge found in India preserved in amber dates back some 54 million years, says an international team of paleontologists. From studying the amber from Gujarat State in western India, the research team led by University of Bonn scientist Frauke Stebner concluded the specimen was a female about 0.9\u2009mm long. The ancient insect, named Camptopterohelea odora, had an unusual structure at the front edge of the wings. C. odora exhibits a complex, pocket shaped structure on the wings, which resembles the wing folds of certain moth flies and scent organs that are only known from butterflies and moths so far, the scientists said. They assume that these pockets were used by the female midge to collect store and spray disseminate pheromones in an unusually efficient way in order to attract sexual partners. Biting midge species alive today do not have these pockets on their wings, Stebner noted. The structure protrudes from the wings like a bubble that is open at the bottom with an edge made from fine hairs. Butterflies have very similar pockets on their front wings, which they use to spray pheromones into the air in order to attract a mate, Stebner said. The position at the edge of the wing makes it possible to spray the messenger substance as widely as possible into the surrounding air. The small hairs clearly ensure, via turbulence, that the distribution is even more successful. Present day biting midges use attractants for their blind dates  however, they do not distribute the substances from their wings but instead from their abdomen. It is noticeable that the pheromone evaporators in Camptopterohelea odora are much more complex than in present day biting midges, said senior author Prof. Jes Rust, also from the University of Bonn. The environmental conditions in the 54 million year old primeval forests in what is now India clearly made such an adaptation necessary. Presumably there were various species of insect at that time that all wanted to attract their sexual partners using pheromones. Unusually effective distribution techniques were probably necessary in order to thrive in this pheromone concert. The team describes Camptopterohelea odora in the latest issue of the journal Scientific Reports.

The new fossil shark, named Megalolamna paradoxodon, belongs to a group called Lamniformes, which includes modern day great white Carcharodon carcharias and mako Isurus spp. sharks. More specifically, it belongs to Otodontidae, which contains the extinct Carcharocles megalodon, or the megatoothed shark, and as an otodontid, Megalolamna paradoxodon represents a close cousin of the megatoothed lineage, said Dr. Kenshu Shimada of DePaul University and the Sternberg Museum in Kansas. The paper describing Megalolamna paradoxodon was published online today in the journal Historical Biology, and was also contributed to by researchers at the University of Hong Kong, the Natural History Museum, London and North Carolina State University. Certain dental features suggest its otodontid affinity, but in many other aspects, teeth of the new fossil shark look superficially like over sized teeth of the modern day salmon shark that belongs to the genus Lamna  hence the new genus Megalolamna, the authors said. Megalolamna paradoxodon were as long as 13 feet 4 m from snout to tail and lived in shallow water, shelf type, coastal environments. The species had grasping type front teeth and cutting type rear teeth up to 1.8 inches, or 4.5 cm, tall likely used to seize and slice medium sized fish. Its quite remarkable that such a large lamniform shark with such a global distribution had evaded recognition until now, especially because there are numerous Miocene localities where fossil shark teeth are well sampled, Dr. Shimada said. In classifying the ancient marine creature, Dr. Shimada and co authors also came to a conclusion that members of the megatoothed lineage, including Carcharocles megalodon, ought to be classified into the genus Otodus, and not to its traditional genus Carcharocles. The idea that megalodon and its close allies should be placed in Otodus is not new, but our study is the first of its kind that logically demonstrates the taxonomic proposition, Dr. Shimada said. Because the megatoothed shark lineage simply represents a subset of Otodus, excluding megatoothed sharks would not reflect a full lineage for Otodus  an uncomfortable taxonomic condition referred to as non monophyletic. The inclusion of megatoothed sharks into Otodus would make the genus a much preferred complete lineage referred to as a monophyletic group that is considered to be a next of kin to the new genus Megalolamna. "}, {"title": " Drepanosaurus: Triassic Reptile Had Huge Claw", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Sep 30, 2016", "doc": "212 million year old fossils discovered in New Mexico confirm that Drepanosaurus, a Late Triassic tree dwelling reptile, was a small bodied creature with a fearsome finger. The second digit of its forelimb sported a huge claw. Yale University researcher Dr. Adam Pritchard and co authors analyzed a series of three dimensionally preserved forelimbs and isolated forelimb bones of Drepanosaurus full name Drepanosaurus unguicaudatus that were discovered at the Hayden Quarry in the Chinle Formation of New Mexico. Their findings were published online September 29, 2016 in the journal Current Biology. Drepanosaurus was previously known only from Italy, where a badly crushed skeleton was collected at Endenna cave in the Zorzino Limestone Formation in 1980. The ancient creature is neither a dinosaur nor a lizard. It is a member of Drepanosauromorpha, a group of Triassic reptiles with lizard like body proportions and elongate, slender digits likely adapted for specialized grasping. Drepanosaurus stretches the bounds of what we think can evolve in the limbs of four footed animals, Dr. Pritchard said. Ecologically, Drepanosaurus seems to be a sort of chameleon anteater hybrid, which is really bizarre for the time. It possesses a totally unique forelimb. Four limbed animals with a backbone are called tetrapods. In nearly all tetrapods, the forearm is made up of two, elongate and parallel bones  the radius and the ulna. These bones connect to a series of much shorter, wrist bones at the base of the hand. Drepanosaurus, however, has radius and ulna bones that are not parallel. Instead, the ulna is a flat, crescent shaped bone. Also, the two wrist bones that meet the end of the ulna are long rather than short. They are longer than the radius, in fact. The bone contacts suggest that the enlarged claw of Drepanosaurus could have been hooked into insect nests, Dr. Pritchard said. The entire arm could then have been powerfully retracted to tear open the nest. This motion is very similar to the hook and pull digging of living anteaters, which also eat insects. Drepanosaurus also had grasping feet and a claw like structure at the tip of its tail. The findings suggest that tetrapods developed specialized, modern ecological roles more than 200 million years ago. "}, {"title": " Rativates evadens: New Ostrich-Mimic Dinosaur Species Identified", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Sep 28, 2016", "doc": "An international team of paleontologists, led by Carleton University researcher Bradley McFeeters, has added another ornithomimid dinosaur to the prehistoric catalog, and this one was found in the Canadian province of Alberta. The new dinosaur, named Rativates evadens, is thought to have lived about 76 million years ago Late Cretaceous period. It was about 11 feet 3.3 m long and 5 feet 1.5 m tall. It weighed about 200 pounds 90 kg and resembled a modern ostrich, but had long, fingered arms and a long tail. A partial skeleton of Rativates evadens was collected in 1934 from the lower Dinosaur Park Formation near Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta, Canada. Rativates evadens was previously identified as another specimen of the more common ostrich mimic dinosaur Struthiomimus altus, but lacks the key diagnostic characters of that species, McFeeters explained. We can tell that it is a new species based on features of its skull, tail, pelvis and feet, including the shape of the long bones of the feet. The referral of fossils to the named species of ostrich mimic dinosaurs like Struthiomimus is complicated because many specimens are incomplete, said team member Dr. Michael Ryan, from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. The recognition of Rativates evadens helps clear up these problems, and at the same time strengthens a connection between Canadian ornithomimids and their Asian cousins. We histologically thin sectioned the femur of Rativates evadens to analyze its growth and determined it was at least eight years old and nearly adult sized at the time of death, said Thomas Cullen, from the University of Toronto. This is only 80 as long, and half as massive as, the adult size of the closely related species Struthiomimus altus, that is estimated to have weighed 385 pounds 175 kg. This suggests that there are at least two differently sized, but closely related dinosaur species that lived together on the ancient landscape, similar to what we see today in the closely related predators like foxes, coyotes and wolves, said Dr. Claudia Schr\u00f6der Adams, of Carleton University. Although it is a member of Theropoda carnivorous dinosaurs, Rativates evadens lacked teeth and, similar to birds, had beaked mouths. The new species and other ornithomimid dinosaurs are believed to have been omnivorous, meaning they ate plants, insects and other small animals. Their long, powerful legs would have made them fast runners like\u00a0Gallimimus in the original Jurassic Park movie, whether they were hunting prey or escaping from larger predators, like Gorgosaurus. Although no skin impressions were found with the fossil, the closely related ornithomimid, Ornithomimus, also from Alberta, is known to have had a downy covering over most of its body. It may have had true feathers as well. The research describing Rativates evadens was published on September 20, 2016 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. "}, {"title": " Researchers Find Ancient Proteins in 3.8-Million-Year-Old Ostrich Eggshells", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Sep 27, 2016", "doc": "A multinational team of researchers has uncovered fossil proteins dating back 3.8 million years  a discovery that will enhance future understanding of ancient organisms. Fragments of ancient ostrich eggshells are abundant in Africa, and often found at archaeological and paleontological sites. They were exploited by the earliest modern humans as raw materials to make art, and jewelry and, or for carrying water. The shell is very thick and hardwearing and therefore survives under many different environmental conditions. A new study published in the journal eLife suggests that survival of protein fragments in the ancient eggshell could provide genetic information almost 50 times older than any DNA record. The studys authors analyzed and tracked egg fossils from archaeological sites in Tanzania and South Africa, where it is expected DNA and proteins would not survive the extreme environmental conditions. Twenty four eggshell samples were sourced from well dated sites in South Africa and Tanzania Elands Bay Cave 300 16,000 years, Pinnacle Point Caves 50,000 150,000 years, Wonderwerk Cave one million years, Olduvai Gorge 1.34 million years and Laetoli 2.6 4.3 million years, they said. The team speculated that proteins might survive better if they were stuck onto solid surfaces. Evidence suggested that it was the more fluid, unstable, region of the protein that promoted and regulated mineral growth in the shell, but it was also less likely to survive over time and the intense heat of the African climate, said study lead author Dr. Beatrice Demarchi, from the University of York, UK. As we examined older and older eggshells, we could see that this assumption was surprisingly wrong, as it was in fact the unstable regions that survived the best. They were able to bind more strongly to the eggshell, allowing it be preserved in time. To date, DNA analysis from frozen sediments has been able to reach back to about 700,000 years ago, but human evolution left most of its traces in Africa and the higher temperature there takes its toll on DNA preservation, said senior author Prof. Matthew Collins, also from the University of York. We had known for many years that proteins could give more clues into the past, but when we looked at protein decay in eggshells, it gave us unusual results when compared to other fossil materials and, until now, we have not really known why. Ancient proteins derived from the enamel of fossil teeth have the potential to yield important clues to the evolutionary relationships, species identity, sex, and migration patterns of early human ancestors, said co author Prof. Terry Harrison, of New York University. Remarkably, the oldest eggshell in the study  from the famous 3.8 million year old site of Laetoli in Tanzania  a region of the protein was still there, giving us a unique insight into what to look for when analyzing fossils of this kind, said co author Dr. Colin Freeman, from the University of Sheffield, UK. Now that we know minerals can trap and preserve proteins in this way, we can be much more targeted in our study of ancient remains. A separate discovery from the team yielded ancient proteins from 1.7 million year old tooth enamel of extinct mammals  deer, horses, and rhinoceroses  from the Dmanisi site in Georgia, which is the oldest site outside of Africa bearing the remains of human ancestors. These findings open up the possibility of recovering remnants of ancient proteins from the earliest human fossils, Prof. Harrison said.

The ancient reptile has been given the official name Triopticus primus, which means the first of three eyes. From the Latin tri three and optic vision for the large opening in the skull roof, resembling a third eye socket. The specific name is from the Latin primus first, the paleontologists explained. Triopticus primus belonged to a group of reptiles called archosauriformes. Complete details of what this creature looked like and how big it was are not yet known, though it was likely no bigger than an alligator. For now, paleontologists only have a fragment of skull. The remainder of the face and jaw, the vertebrae, and the rest of the skeleton is missing, either long lost to natural elements. The fossil was found at the Otis Chalk Quarry 3 in Howard County, Texas. Triopticus primus had a thickened skull roof, just like the dome headed pachycephalosaur dinosaurs that lived more than 100 million years later. And even more unexpected, many of the other extinct animals found with this creature resemble later dinosaurs as well. Triopticus primus is an extraordinary example of evolutionary convergence between the relatives of dinosaurs and crocodylians and later dinosaurs that is much more common than anyone ever expected, said Dr. Michelle Stocker, of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and the University of Texas at Austin. What we thought were unique body shapes in many dinosaurs actually evolved millions of years before in the Triassic period, about 225 million years ago. Convergence  where distantly related animals evolve to look very similar to each other  is a widely recognized phenomenon in evolutionary biology. A classic example of this is a bird wing and a bat wing  both animals use their wings for flight, but the inner details of those wings are different and evolved independently. Many of the other Triassic reptiles buried with Triopticus primus in the Otis Chalk fauna display structures that are easily recognized in later dinosaurs as well, such as the long snouts of Spinosaurus, the toothless beaks of ornithomimids, and the armor plates of ankylosaurs. It is extremely rare to have so many diverse species in a single ancient community be converged upon over a broad swath of later geologic time, the scientists said. The Otis Chalk fauna is an amazing single snapshot of geologic time where you have this extraordinary range of animal body plans all present at the same time living together, said Dr. Stocker, lead author of a report published this week on Triopticus primus in the journal Current Biology. Among the animals preserved in the Otis Chalk fauna, Triopticus primus exemplifies this phenomenon of body shape convergence because its skull shape was repeated by very distantly related dome headed dinosaurs more than 100 million years later. Dinosaurs, like these distant cousins from the Triassic period, are all reptiles. Reptiles rapidly evolved in terms of numbers of species soon after the greatest mass extinction of all time on Earth, at the end of the Permian period. After the enormous mass extinction 250 million years ago, reptiles exploded onto the scene and almost immediately diversified into many different sizes and shapes, said Dr. Sterling Nesbitt, also from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and the University of Texas at Austin. These early body shapes were later mimicked by dinosaurs.

Iguania chameleons, agamas, iguanas and New World lizards is one of the most diverse groups of extant lizards, spanning from acrodontan iguanians those with teeth fused to the top of their jaws dominating the Old World to non acrodontans in the New World, as well as Madagascar and a few Pacific islands. The new fossil species, dubbed Jeddaherdan aleadonta, is an acrodontan lizard, constituting the first iguanian from the Mesozoic of Africa. It is the oldest known iguanian from Africa  about 40 million years older than the previous oldest acrodontan record from the continent. The 90 million year old jaw of Jeddaherdan aleadonta was unearthed in the Kem Kem region of southeastern Morocco. The lizard was contemporaneous with well known reptiles from this region, such as the dinosaur Spinosaurus. It belongs to the same group that is currently widespread in the African continent today, including Morocco. This indicates living African lizard lineages have inhabited that continent for at least 90 million years. Jeddaherdan aleadonta is of a similar age, and has a number of similarities, to Gueragama sulamericana, a recently discovered lizard species from the Late Cretaceous of Brazil. This indicates important similarities between African and South American faunas at 90 million years ago. Importantly, this was a crucial time in the history of the planet with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean taking place and separating Africa and South America. The discovery is detailed in the September 2016 issue of the journal Royal Society Open Science. Looking at these lizards from the past tells us a lot about their history, said co author Dr. Juan Diego Daza, from Sam Houston State University. Jeddaherdan aleadonta has unique dentition, something that we cannot find in any close relative today. Its unique dental morphology makes me wonder about its dietary or tropic specialization, and aspect of its biology that we might never be able to know with certainty. Our knowledge of lizard evolution in the African continent is largely enigmatic. This finding reveals important similarities between South American and African lizard faunas in a distant geological past, added co author Dr. Tiago Sim\u00f5es, from the University of Alberta, Canada. The discovery of Jeddaherdan aleadonta also suggests new findings in Africa may provide crucial clues towards understanding the origin of both African and South American lizards. Jeddaherdan aleadonta shows that similar acrodont lizards lived in South America and Africa before separation of the two continents by the South Atlantic Ocean, said senior author Dr. Jean Claude Rage, from the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, France. Subsequently, acrodonts developped in Africa, but they disappeared from South America at an unknown time.

If we could step back in time 8 million years, youd basically see the same animal crawling around then as you would see today in the Southeast, said lead researcher Dr. Evan Whiting, from the University of Minnesota. Even 30 million years ago, they didnt look much different, he added. We were surprised to find fossil alligators from this deep in time that actually belong to the living species, rather than an extinct one. He and his colleagues describe the alligator as a survivor, withstanding sea level fluctuations and extreme changes in climate that would have caused some less adaptive animals to rapidly change or go extinct. The scientists began re thinking the alligators evolutionary history after Dr. Whiting examined an ancient alligator skull, originally thought to be an extinct species, unearthed in Marion County, Florida, and found it to be virtually identical to the iconic modern species. They compared the ancient skull with dozens of other fossils and modern skeletons to look at the whole genus and trace major changes, or the lack thereof, in alligator morphology. The authors also studied the carbon and oxygen compositions of the teeth of both ancient alligators and the 20  to 25 foot extinct crocodile Gavialosuchus americanus that once dominated the Florida coastline and died out about 5 million years ago for unknown reasons. The presence of alligator and Gavialosuchus fossils at several localities in north Florida suggest the two species may have coexisted in places near the coast, Dr. Whiting said. Analysis of the teeth suggests, however, that Gavialosuchus americanus was a marine reptile, which sought its prey in ocean waters, while alligators tended to hunt in freshwater and on land. That doesnt mean alligators werent occasionally eaten by the marine crocs, though. The gators we see today do not really compete with anything, but millions of years ago it was not only competing with another type of crocodilian, it was competing with a much larger one, said co author Dr. David Steadman, from the Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida UF. The presence of the ancient crocodile in Florida may have helped keep the alligators in freshwater habitats, though it appears alligators have always been most comfortable in freshwater. While modern alligators do look prehistoric as they bake on sandbars along the Suwannee River or stroll down sidewalks on the UF campus, they are not somehow immune to evolution, the researchers said. On the contrary, they are the result of an incredibly ancient evolutionary line. The group they belong to, Crocodylia, has been around for at least 84 million years and has diverse ancestors dating as far back as the Triassic, more than 200 million years ago.

The camouflage patterns on this fossil include countershading, which functions by counter illuminating shadows on the body of an organism. The team, co headed by University of Bristol researchers Jakob Vinther and Innes Cuthill, found that Psittacosaurus, an early relative of the famed horned dinosaur Triceratops, was light on its underside and darker on top. This color pattern, known as countershading, is a common form of camouflage in modern animals. According to the scientists, Psittacosaurus most likely lived in an environment with diffuse light, such as in a forest. The fossil preserves clear countershading, which has been shown to function by counter illuminating shadows on a body, thus making an animal appear optically flat to the eye of the beholder, Dr. Vinther said. By reconstructing a life size 3D model, we were able to not only see how the patterns of shading changed over the body, but also that it matched the sort of camouflage which would work best in a forested environment, Prof. Cuthill added. Countershading most likely served to protect this dinosaur species against predators that use patterns of shadow on an object to determine shape, just as humans do. Dr. Vinther, Prof. Cuthill and their colleagues from the United States, the UK, Germany and Hong Kong realized that structures previously thought to be artifacts or dead bacteria in the dinosaurs fossilized feathers were actually melanosomes, small structures that carry melanin pigments found in the feathers and skin of many animals. In some well preserved specimens, such as Psittacosaurus in this study, its possible to make out the patterns of preserved melanin without the aid of a microscope. Our Psittacosaurus was reconstructed from the inside out. There are thousands of scales, all different shapes and sizes, and many of them are only partially pigmented, said team member Robert Nicholls, from Palaeocreations in Bristol, UK. It was a painstaking process but we now have the best suggestion as to what this dinosaur really looked like. In order to investigate what environment Psittacosaurus had evolved to live in, the team took another cast of the model and painted it all grey. They then placed it in the Cretaceous plant section of Bristol Botanic Garden and photographed it under an open sky and underneath trees to see how the shadow was cast under those conditions. By comparing the shadow to the pattern in the fossil they could then predict what environment this dinosaur lived in. We predicted that Psittacosaurus must have lived in a forest, Dr. Vinther said. This demonstrates that fossil color patterns can provide not only a better picture of what extinct animals looked like, but they can also give new clues about extinct ecologies and habitats. We were amazed to see how well these color patterns actually worked to camouflage this little dinosaur. The teams findings were published online September 15, 2016 in the journal Current Biology.

The team, headed by University of Wollongongs Professor Allen Nutman, discovered 3.7 billion year old stromatolite fossils in the Isua Greenstone Belt Isua supracrustal belt, or ISB along the edge of Greenlands icecap. We report evidence for ancient life from a newly exposed outcrop of 3.7 billion year old metacarbonate rocks in the ISB that contain 1 4 cm high stromatolites, macroscopically layered structures produced by microbial communities, the scientists said. This indicates that as long as 3.7 billion years ago microbial life was already diverse, Prof. Nutman added. This diversity shows that life emerged within the first few hundred millions years of Earths existence, which is in keeping with biologists calculations showing the great antiquity of lifes genetic code. Stromatolite fossils are the most persistent evidence of life in Earth history, and are known from the present for example, Shark Bay, Western Australia to 3.48 billion years ago in the rock record. The significance of stromatolites is that not only do they provide obvious evidence of ancient life that is visible with the naked eye, but that they are complex ecosystems, Prof. Nutman said. The Isua stromatolite fossils predate by 220\u2009million years the previous most convincing and generally accepted evidence for oldest life remains in the 3.48 billion year old Dresser Formation in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The Isua stromatolites  exposed by the recent melting of a perennial snow patch  were shown to have grown in a shallow marine setting, providing the first evidence of an environment in which early life thrived. The ISB stromatolites grew in a shallow marine environment, as indicated by seawater like rare earth element plus yttrium trace element signatures of the metacarbonates, and by interlayered detrital sedimentary rocks with cross lamination and storm wave generated breccias, Prof. Nutman and co authors explained. This discovery turns the study of planetary habitability on its head, said co lead investigator Dr. Vickie Bennett, of the Australian National University. Rather than speculating about potential early environments, for the first time we have rocks that we know record the conditions and environments that sustained early life. Our research will provide new insights into chemical cycles and rock water microbe interactions on a young planet. It was a groundbreaking find that could point to similar life structures on Mars, which 3.7 billion years ago was a damp environment, said co author Prof. Martin Van Kranendonk, of the University of New South Wales. The structures and geochemistry from newly exposed outcrops in Greenland display all of the features used in younger rocks to argue for a biological origin, he said. This discovery represents a new benchmark for the oldest preserved evidence of life on Earth. It points to a rapid emergence of life on Earth and supports the search for life in similarly ancient rocks on Mars. The teams findings were published online this week in the journal Nature.

The new pterosaur belonged to a group of short winged and toothless pterosaurs called the azhdarchids. It is unusual as most Late Cretaceous pterosaurs were much larger with wingspans of 13 36 feet 4 11 m. Previous studies suggest that the Late Cretaceous skies were only occupied by birds and large pterosaurs, but this new finding, which is reported in the journal Open Science, provides important information about the diversity and success of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs. This new pterosaur is exciting because it suggests that small pterosaurs were present all the way until the end of the Cretaceous, and werent outcompeted by birds, said lead author Elizabeth Martin Silverstone, from the University of Southampton. The hollow bones of pterosaurs are notoriously poorly preserved, and larger animals seem to be preferentially preserved in similarly aged Late Cretaceous ecosystems of North America. This suggests that a small pterosaur would very rarely be preserved, but not necessarily that they didnt exist. Although fragmentary and poorly preserved, the specimen is the first associated remains of a small bodied pterosaur from the Late Cretaceous. The fossilized bones a humerus, dorsal vertebrae and other fragments were found on Hornby Island in British Columbia in 2009. The specimen is far from the prettiest or most complete pterosaur fossil youll ever see, but its still an exciting and significant find, said co author Dr. Mark Witton, from the University of Portsmouth. Its rare to find pterosaur fossils at all because their skeletons were lightweight and easily damaged once they died, and the small ones are the rarest of all. But luck was on our side and several bones of this animal survived the preservation process. Happily, enough of the specimen was recovered to determine the approximate age of the pterosaur at the time of its death. By examining its internal bone structure and the fusion of its vertebrae we could see that, despite its small size, the animal was almost fully grown. The specimen thus seems to be a genuinely small species, and not just a baby or juvenile of a larger pterosaur type. The absence of small juveniles of large species  which must have existed  in the fossil record is evidence of a preservational bias against small pterosaurs in the Late Cretaceous, Martin Silverstone said. It adds to a growing set of evidence that the Late Cretaceous period was not dominated by large or giant species, and that smaller pterosaurs may have been well represented in this time.

Pterosaurs were highly successful flying reptiles that lived between 210 million and 65 million years ago. These creatures were Earths first winged vertebrates, with birds and bats making their appearances much later. They first appeared in the Late Triassic and went on to achieve high levels of morphologic and taxonomic diversity during the Mesozoic era, with more than 150 species recognized so far. Pterosaurs have traditionally been divided into two major groups the primitive, primarily long tailed rhamphorhynchoids preferably currently recognized as non pterodactyloids and the derived short tailed pterodactyloids. They had an extraordinary adaptation to flight, including pneumatic bones to lighten its weight, and an elongated digit supporting a wing membrane. Some were the largest flying animals of all time, with wingspans exceeding 30 feet. Pterosaurs are not rare in the fossil record, but their neuroanatomy is known from only a few three dimensionally preserved remains and, until now, there was no information on the intermediate forms. Named Allkauren koi, the newly discovered winged reptile is represented by several skeletal elements including an almost perfect, three dimensionally preserved braincase that shows a unique combination of characters shared with both pterodactyloids and breviquartossans non pterodactyloids. The fossilized material comes from a single locality within the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Asfalto Formation in northern central Chubut Province, Patagonia, Argentina. Allkauren koi, from the middle lower Jurassic limit, shows an intermediate state in the brain evolution of pterosaurs and their adaptations to the aerial environment, said Dr. Diego Pol, a paleontologist at the Museum of Paleontology Egidio Feruglio in Trelew, Chubut, Argentina. As a result, this research makes an important contribution to the understanding of the evolution of all of pterosaurs. The research appears today August 30, 2016 in the journal PeerJ.

The cave bear, first described in 1774 by Johann Friederich Esper, was a species of bear that lived in Europe during the Pleistocene epoch and became extinct about 25,000 years ago. The animal weighed between 500 and 1,100 pounds 225 500 kg, was 8.9 11.5 feet 2.7 3.5 m long and up to 5.6 feet 1.7 m at the shoulder. Despite their name, cave bears didnt actually live in caves but only used them for hibernation. Nevertheless, the occasional death of animals in various caves in Europe over several tens of thousands of years eventually led to enormous accumulations of bones and teeth. Several of these bones from Goyet Cave in Belgium have now been examined by Prof. Herv\u00e9 Bocherens of the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment at the University of T\u00fcbingen and co authors. We were particularly interested in what exactly the cave bears ate, and whether there is a connection between their diet and their extinction, Prof. Bocherens said. To this end, the team conducted isotope studies on the collagen from the bears bones. Collagen is an essential organic component of the connective tissue in bones, teeth, cartilage, tendons, ligaments and the skin. The examination of the isotope composition of individual amino acids in the collagen shows that cave bears had a strictly herbivorous diet. Similar to todays giant panda, cave bears were therefore extremely inflexible in regard to their food, said Prof. Bocherens, who is the senior author of a paper detailing the findings in the Journal of Quaternary Science. We assume that this unbalanced diet, in combination with the reduced supply of plants during the last Ice Age, ultimately led to the cave bears extinction. During the investigation, another interesting aspect came to light. Even the collagen of two cave bear cubs indicated a vegan diet  despite the fact that they were suckled by their mother, the paleontologists said. We interpret this finding as a reflection of the nursing females diet.

The new species, named Microleo attenboroughi, is described in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica, based on a partial skull and teeth. Its dentition includes an elongate, knife like premolar in front of basined molars  specialized features which are common to all members of the Thylacoleonidae, an extraordinary family of extinct marsupial carnivores from Australia, referred to as marsupial lions. The fossilized remains of Microleo attenboroughi were found in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, northwestern Queensland, and analyzed by experts from the University of New South Wales. The species name honors Sir David Attenborough for his dedication and enthusiasm in promoting the natural history of the world and the paleontological treasures of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in particular, the authors explained. Microleo attenboroughi was much smaller than the other members of Thylacoleonidae, including its most famous relative  Thylacoleo carnifex. Microleo attenboroughi would have been more like the cute, but still feisty kitten of the family, said lead author Dr. Anna Gillespie, of the PANGEA Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. It was not lion size or even bob cat size. Weighing only about 600 grams, it was more like a ringtail possum in size. Microleo attenboroughi was recovered from a limestone deposit believed to have formed in a pool within a rainforest landscape about 19 million years ago, during the Miocene epoch. The fossil deposit has already revealed a rich fauna including at least six different kinds of bandicoots, many kinds of possums and kangaroos, toothed platypuses, diminutive koalas, thousands of bats, fish, turtles, lizards, pythons and birds including storks, logrunners and the earliest known Australian parrot. Despite its relatively small size compared with Thylacoleo carnifex, the new species was one of the larger flesh eaters existing in its ancient community of rainforest creatures at Riversleigh, said Prof. Mike Archer, also from the PANGEA Research Centre at the University of New South Wales. The diversity of marsupial lions alive at this time at Riversleigh is unmatched in the fossil record from anywhere else on the continent. Microleo attenboroughi shared these northern Miocene rainforests with two larger species of marsupial lion, one cat sized and the other dog sized, Dr. Gillespie added. Although it is possible they competed with one other, the size differences probably means they each specialized on a different size range of prey. Its likely that\u00a0Microleo attenboroughi scampered amongst the tree tops, gobbling insects as well as small vertebrates such as lizards and birds while simultaneously trying to avoid becoming a prey item for its larger relatives, she said.

New fossil evidence from Mexican and Dominican fossilized amber indicates that they were doing so 20 million years ago Miocene epoch, according to Oregon State University scientist George Poinar, Jr. The discovery is detailed in a paper published today in the journal American Entomologist. My paper points out that beetles may play a more important role in pollinating orchids than originally thought, and that they have been doing so for some 20 million years, Dr. Poinar said. In his paper, Dr. Poinar describes beetles found in chunks of Mexican and Dominican amber with orchid pollen in their mouthparts. Some extant beetles use orchids for nectar, but no fossil evidence has ever been found showing beetles in the evolutionary past pollinating orchids  until now. The first specimen was a hidden snout beetle subfamily Cryptorhynchinae found in a piece of 20 45 million year old amber from the Dominican Republic. This specimen had pollinaria from an orchid described as Cylindrocites browni attached to its thorax. The weevil length\u2009 \u20094.0\u2009mm is a member of the Cryptorhynchini, a group known as the hidden snout weevils because in repose, the beak is partly concealed against the thorax and between the front coxae, Dr. Poinar explained. The larvae breed in stems or wood and the adults are known to visit flowers. Cryptorhynchinae were quite diverse in the Dominican amber forest. The other specimen was a toe winged beetle family Ptilodactylidae that was found in a piece of 22 26 million year old Mexican amber. This toe winged beetle 1.4\u2009mm in length had pollinaria from an orchid described as Annulites mexicana attached to its mouthparts. While other beetles are known to pollinate plants, no current day hidden snout beetles have been seen visiting orchid plants, and no current day toe winged beetles have been seen with pollinaria. The reason may lie in the beetles secretive behavior, which makes it difficult to collect data about them, Dr. Poinar said. While no present day cryptorhynchid weevils or ptilodactyline beetles are known to carry pollinaria, past and future collections of these and other beetles should be examined to search for attached pollinaria. Orchids may have evolved beneficial associations with a much wider range of beetles and other insects than we thought possible.

The marsupial lion was a predatory marsupial that inhabited Australia during the Pleistocene epoch from about 2.5 million years ago until as recently as a few tens of thousands of years ago. It was the continents top predator at the time of human arrival 50,000 years ago. The animal was first described from fossils in 1859 by English paleontologist Sir Richard Owen. It was 5 feet 1.5 m long, 2.5 feet 75 cm tall, and weighed between\u00a0175 and 220 pounds 80 100 kg  making it the largest carnivorous marsupial to have ever lived on Earth. As its name suggests, the marsupial lion has long been presumed to be a cat like predator, despite lacking large canine teeth  instead it had large, protruding incisors that have been suggested to be canine substitutes. The prehistoric creature was a powerful marsupial but, as other paleontologists have noted, it had limbs of different proportions to a lion, suggesting it was not a fast. It also sported a very large claw on its hand, similar to the dew claw of cats but of a much bigger size, with a bony sheath foisted on a mobile first digit thumb. Dr. Christine Janis from the University of Bristol and Brown University and her colleagues from the University of Malaga looked at the elbow joints of a large number of living mammals. This showed a strong association between the anatomy of the humerus upper arm bone where it articulates with the forelimb and the locomotor behavior of mammals. Animals more specialized for running like a dog have a joint indicating movement limited for back and forwards, stabilizing their bodies on the ground, while animals more specialized for climbing like a monkey have a joint that allows for rotation of the hand around the elbow. Modern cats, which unlike dogs use their forelimbs to grapple with their prey, have an elbow joint of intermediate shape. If the marsupial lion had hunted like a lion using its forelimbs to manipulate its prey, then its elbow joint should have been lion like, Dr. Janis said. But, surprisingly, it a unique elbow joint among living predatory mammals  one that suggested a great deal of rotational capacity of the hand, like an arboreal mammal, but also features not seen in living climbers, that would have stabilized the limb on the ground suggesting that it was not simply a climber. The team proposed that this unique elbow joint, in combination with the huge dew claw on a mobile thumb, would have allowed the marsupial lion to use that claw to kill its prey. In contrast the large incisors were blunt. While the animal had massive shearing teeth in the back of its jaw, the incisors appear to have functioned better for gripping than for piercing flesh in a killing bite. The scientists concluded that, unlike a real lion, which holds its prey with its claws, and kills it with its teeth, the marsupial lion  unlike any living predator  used its teeth to hold its prey, while it dispatched it with its huge claws. The teams research was published in the journal Paleobiology.

The fossil in question is a partial skull about 9 inches 23 cm long. It was found in southeastern Alaska in 1951 by U.S. Geological Survey geologist Donald J. Miller, and then spent decades in the Smithsonians collection. It was analyzed by Smithsonian Institution researchers Nicholas Pyenson and Alexandra Boersma, who described it as a new genus and species and named it Arktocara yakataga. By studying the skull and comparing it to those of other dolphins, both living and extinct, the team determined that Arktocara yakataga is a relative of the South Asian river dolphin Platanista gangetica, which is the sole surviving species of a once large and diverse group of dolphins. The skull, which is among the oldest fossils ever found from that group, called Platanistoidea, confirms that the South Asian river dolphin belongs to one of the oldest lineages of toothed whales still alive today. The South Asian river dolphin  a species that includes both the Ganges river dolphin and the Indus river dolphin  is of great interest to scientists. It is an unusual creature that swims on its side, cannot see and uses echolocation to navigate murky rivers in Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Unlike its known ancestors, it lives only in fresh water. Today, Platanista gangetica is distributed in two subspecies across the Indus, Ganges Brahmaputra Megna and Karnaphuli Sangu river systems of Southeast Asia, and remains highly threatened by human activities, including by catch, fishing, and habitat modification, the scientists explained. One of the most useful ways we can study Platanista is by studying its evolutionary history, by looking at fossils that are related to it to try to get a better sense of where its coming from, Dr. Boersma added. The paleontologists estimate that the Arktocara yakataga fossil comes from the late Oligocene epoch, around the time ancient whales diversified into two groups baleen and toothed whales. Fossils from Platanista gangeticas now extinct relatives have been found in marine deposits around the world, but the Arktocara yakataga fossil is the northernmost find to date. Considering the only living dolphin in this group is restricted to freshwater systems in Southeast Asia, to find a relative that was all the way up in Alaska 25 million years ago was kind of mind boggling, Dr. Boersma said.

In a study published in the journal Current Biology, a team of paleontologists describes Echovenator sandersi, an ancient relative of modern dolphins, and its ability to hear frequencies well above the range of hearing in humans. Our study suggests that high frequency hearing may have preceded the emergence of echolocation, said lead author Dr. Morgan Churchill, from New York Institute of Technology. Previous studies have looked at hearing in whales but our study incorporates data from an animal with a very complete skull, he added. The data we gathered enabled us to conclude that it could hear at very high frequencies, and we can also say with a great degree of certainty where it fits in the tree of life for whales. Echovenator sandersi flourished during the Oligocene epoch, about 27 million years ago. It was a small, toothed whale that probably used its remarkable sense of hearing to find and pursue fish with echoes only. This would allow it to hunt at night, but more importantly, it could hunt at great depths in darkness, or in very sediment choked environments, said co author Dr. Jonathan Geisler, also from New York Institute of Technology. To learn more about Echovenator sandersi, the scientists studied the whales skull discovered in South Carolina 2001. They CT scanned Echovenator sandersis ear and compared it to those of two hippos and 23 fossil and living whales. The analyses uncovered many features found today in dolphins, which can hear at ultrasonic frequencies. The anatomy of the ancient whales ear suggests that most of the specializations associated with high frequency hearing evolved about 27 million years ago about the same time as echolocation and that traits associated with this ability actually predate the emergence of toothed whales. It also suggests that the evolutionary ancestors of toothed whales could hear at higher frequencies than their relatives on land. The inner ear of Echovenator sandersi is surprisingly similar to that of modern whales, Dr. Churchill said. In fact, only one trait of the ancient whales ear was more similar to primitive whales than to modern whales, suggesting a very rapid evolution of hearing abilities in early whales. About 60 million years ago, the semiaquatic ancestor of whales had a limited ability to hear high frequencies, the paleontologists said. Some degree of high frequency hearing evolved before echolocation and then became even more specialized in modern toothed whales. Baleen whales, which do not echolocate and are specialized to hear low frequency sound, lost some of these initial specializations for hearing high frequency sound. Echovenator sandersi is remarkable in other ways too, Dr. Churchill said. For instance, the ancient whale was remarkably small compared to its ancestors, suggesting a drastic change in body size early in toothed whale evolution that most likely influenced a range of variables, from brain size to ecology. "}, {"title": " Dinosaurs Had Bird-Like Color Vision, Gene Discovery Suggests", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Aug 3, 2016", "doc": "According to an international team of scientists led by Dr. Nicholas Mundy at the University of Cambridge, a gene for red color vision that originated in the reptile lineage approximately 250 million years ago has resulted in the red bird feathers and painted turtles, and may be evidence that dinosaurs could see as many shades of red as birds. Earlier this year, two groups of scientists independently identified an enzyme encoding gene that enables birds to produce and display the color red. Now, a new study by one of these groups shows the same gene, called CYP2J19, is also found in turtles, which share an ancient common ancestor with birds. Both share a common ancestor with dinosaurs. CYP2J19 allows birds and turtles to convert the yellow pigments in their diets into red, which they then use to heighten color vision in the red spectrum through droplets of red oil in their retinas. Birds and turtles are the only existing land vertebrates to have these red retinal oil droplets. In some birds and a few turtle species, red pigment produced by the gene is also used for external display red beaks and feathers, or the red neck patches and rims of shells seen in species such as the painted turtle. Dr. Mundy, senior author on the study, and his colleagues from the United Kingdom, the United States and Sweden mined the genetic data of various bird and reptile species to reconstruct an evolutionary history of CYP2J19, and found that it dated back hundreds of millions of years in the ancient archelosaur genetic line  the ancestral lineage of turtles, birds and dinosaurs. The findings provide evidence that CYP2J19 originated around 250 million years ago, predating the split of the turtle lineage from the archosaur line, and runs right the way through turtle and bird evolution. As dinosaurs split from this lineage after turtles, and were closely related to birds, this strongly suggests that they would have carried the CYP2J19 gene, and had the enhanced red vision from the red retinal oil, Dr. Mundy and co authors said. This may have even resulted in some dinosaurs producing bright red pigment for display purposes as well as color vision, as seen in some birds and turtles today, although this is more speculative. These findings are evidence that the red gene originated in the archelosaur lineage to produce red for color vision, and was much later independently deployed in both birds and turtles to be displayed in the red feathers and shells of some species, going from seeing red to being red. This external redness was often sexually selected as an honest signal of genuine high quality in a mate. Previous research in zebra finches showed a possible link between red beaks and the ability to break down toxins in the body, suggesting external redness signals physiological quality, and there is some evidence that coloration in red eared terrapins is also linked to honest signaling. The excellent red spectrum vision provided by the CYP2J19 gene would help female birds and turtles pick the brightest red males, said study first author Hanlu Twyman, also from the University of Cambridge. The structure of retinas in the eye includes cone shaped photoreceptor cells. Unlike mammals, avian and turtle retinal cones contain a range of brightly colored oil droplets, including green, yellow and red. These oil droplets function in a similar way to filters on a camera lens. By filtering the incoming light, the oil droplets lead to greater separation of the range of wavelengths that each cone responds to, creating much better color sensitivity, Dr. Mundy said. Humans can distinguish between some shades of red such as scarlet and crimson. However, birds and turtles can see a host of intermediate reds between these two shades, for example. Our work suggests that dinosaurs would have also had this ability to see a wide spectrum of redness. Over hundreds of millennia of evolution, CYP2J19 was independently deployed to generate the red pigments in the external displays of some bird species and a few turtle species. Co option of CYP2J19 for red coloration in dinosaurs would also have been possible. The ancestral lineage that led to scaly lizards and snakes split from the archosaur line before turtles, and, as the findings suggest, before the origin of the red gene. These reptiles either lack retinal oil droplets, or have yellow and green but not red. However, the crocodilian lineage split from the archelosaur line after turtles, yet crocodiles appear to have lost the CYP2J19 gene, and have no oil droplets of any color in their retinal cones. There is some evidence that oil droplets were lost from the retinas of species that were nocturnal for long periods of their genetic past, and that this hypothesis fits for mammals and snakes, and may also be the case with crocodiles, Dr. Mundy said. The teams findings were published online today in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

The scientists found evidence that St. Paul Island  the largest of the Pribilof Islands, a group of four Alaskan islands located in the Bering Sea  experienced a phase of dry conditions and declining water quality at about the same time the mammoths vanished. The findings were published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Past events on St. Paul Island provided a unique opportunity for research, explained co author Dr. Matthew Wooller, from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Mammoths were trapped there when rising sea levels submerged the Bering Sea land bridge, and survived several thousands of years longer than isolated mainland populations. Dr. Wooller and co authors used a variety of proxies  things in the environment that can be used to independently document the presence of an organism  to investigate the timing, causes, and consequences of mammoth disappearance from the island. In 2013, they collected a sediment core from the bed of one of the few freshwater lakes on the island. Three different spores from fungi that grow on large animal dung were extracted from the core and used to determine when the mammoths were no longer on the island. We see a reduction in the three species of fungus, all of which are associated with the dung of large animals. These spores are a marker for the presence of large animals like mammoths, said lead author Prof. Russ Graham, from Pennsylvania State University. Beside the mammoths, the only animals appearing on the island in prehistoric times were arctic foxes, shrews and polar bears, and there is no evidence of polar bears before 4,000 years ago. Humans did not arrive on the island until 1787 CE. The only large mammals present were mammoths. Sediment DNA from the lake core showed the presence of mammoth DNA until 5,650 years ago, plus or minus 80 years. After that time, there is no mammoth DNA and so no mammoths on the island. The team also measured the stable oxygen isotope ratios of the prehistoric remains of aquatic insects preserved in the sediment from before, during and after the extinction of mammoths. The remains of aquatic organisms living in lakes retain water isotope signatures within their bodies, which allowed the researchers studying their exoskeletons to determine that lake levels had diminished. The remains also changed over time, indicating decreasing lake levels and water quality leading up to the mammoth extinction. Nitrogen isotope analyses of mammoth bones and teeth also signaled progressively drier conditions leading up to the extinction event. Pollen from the lake core indicate that the area around the lake was denuded of vegetation by the mammoths. Like elephants today, when the water became cloudy and turgid, the mammoths probably dug holes nearby to obtain cleaner water. Both of these things increased erosion in the area and helped fill in the lake, decreasing the available water even more. After the extinction of the mammoths, the core shows that erosion stopped and vegetation returned to the area. In essence, the mammoths contributed to their own demise. Five independent indicators of extinction show that mammoths survived on St. Paul until 5,600 years ago, the scientists said. Vegetation composition remained stable during the extinction window, and there is no evidence of human presence on the island before 1787 CE, suggesting that these factors were not extinction drivers. Instead, the extinction coincided with declining freshwater resources and drier climates between 7,850 and 5,600 years ago, as inferred from sedimentary magnetic susceptibility, oxygen isotopes, and diatom and cladoceran assemblages in a sediment core from a freshwater lake on the island, and stable nitrogen isotopes from mammoth remains. Contrary to other extinction models for the St. Paul mammoth population, this evidence indicates that this mammoth population died out because of the synergistic effects of shrinking island area and freshwater scarcity caused by rising sea levels and regional climate change. Degradation of water quality by intensified mammoth activity around the lake likely exacerbated the situation. The St. Paul mammoth demise is now one of the best dated prehistoric extinctions, the researchers said.

We are talking about huge, brick sized molars here  the largest of any animal, but the signs of tooth wear are tiny, down to thousandths of a millimeter. However, these microscopic surface textures can tell us whether they were eating grass or leaves, said team member Zhang Hanwen, from the University of Bristol, UK. By comparing the results with information from modern ruminants deer, antelopes and oxen of known diet, the study concluded two extinct elephant genera from southern China  Sinomastodon and Stegodon  were primarily browsing on leaves. The third, Elephas, which includes the modern Asian elephants, shows much more catholic feeding habit, incorporating both grazing and browsing. Its wonderful that we can identify diets of any fossil mammal with confidence now, said team member Prof. Christine Janis, also from the University of Bristol. Sinomastodon and Stegodon coexisted in southern China between 2.6 and 1 million years ago, but Sinomastodon then became extinct and left Stegodon to become the dominant elephant of southern China for the remainder of the Pleistocene, the time of the great Ice Ages. The fossil pollen record, and recently excavated mammal fossil assemblages from various karst cave sites near the Chinese Vietnamese border, suggest a prolonged, fluctuating period of environmental deterioration around this time, Hanwen said. Forests were on the decline, alongside many of the more archaic mammal species that inhabited them. The highly evolved molars of Stegodon, with multiple enamel ridges, might have allowed it to browse on its preferred foliage in a more efficient way, thus outcompeting Sinomastodon, which preferred the same diet, but had less sophisticated molars consisting of large, blunt, conical cusps. On the other hand, the study also suggests that Stegodon and Elephas subsequently coexisted for long periods in southern China by eating different things. Stegodon remained a specialist foliage feeder whereas Elephas was more of a generalist, consuming a wider variety of vegetation. Stegodon became extinct at around 11,000 years ago, at the end of the Pleistocene, coinciding with the worldwide disappearance of large mammal species at this time, including the woolly mammoths, giant deers and saber toothed cats. The Asian elephant survived in southern China into historical times. The teams findings were published online in the journal Quaternary International on July 26, 2016.

The new dinosaur, named Murusraptor barrosaensis, is thought to have lived about 87 million years ago Upper Cretaceous epoch. It belongs to Megaraptoridae giant thieves, an enigmatic group of medium sized predatory dinosaurs, infamous for hypertrophied claws and air filled, birdlike bones. The partial skeleton of Murusraptor barrosaensis was discovered in Sierra Barrosa, in northwest Patagonia. This specimen appears to be immature, but the paleontologists suggest that the species is larger and slenderer than Megaraptor and comparable in size with Aerosteon and Orkoraptor. This animal, not yet an adult, was roughly 26 feet 8 m long when alive  and was still growing, Prof. Currie said. This is a super cool specimen from a very enigmatic family of big dinosaurs, he added. Because we have most of the skeleton in a single entity, it really helps consolidate their relationships to other animals. The finding represents one of the most complete megaraptorid dinosaurs ever found, with an unusually intact braincase. Its the only known braincase material we have of any megaraptor, Prof. Currie said. Although incomplete, the beautifully preserved bones of Murusraptor barrosaensis unveil unknown information about the skeletal anatomy of megaraptors, Dr. Coria said. While sharing many features with the other species, the new species has distinctive facial features not previously seen amongst megaraptorids, as well as unusually shaped hip bones. While phylogenetic analysis could not clearly determine evolutionary relationships, these fossils provide new anatomical information which might help to resolve current debates as to whether the megaraptorids are a clade of the allosauroid or the coelurosaurid theropods, the scientists said. The discovery is reported July 20 in the journal PLoS ONE.

Just like the bird feather did not initially evolve for flight  we now have early relatives of birds such as tyrannosaur dinosaurs with feathers that definitely were not flying  the earliest beginnings of the turtle shell was not for protection but rather for digging underground to escape the harsh South African environment where these early proto turtles lived, said lead author Dr. Tyler Lyson, from the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. The early evolution of the turtle shell had long puzzled paleontologists. We knew from both the fossil record and observing how the turtle shell develops in modern turtles that one of the first major changes towards a shell was the broadening of the ribs, Dr. Lyson said. While distinctly broadened ribs may not seem like a significant modification, it has a serious impact on both breathing and speed in quadrupedal animals. Ribs are used to support the body during locomotion and play a crucial role in ventilating your lungs. Distinctly broadened ribs stiffen the torso, which shortens an animals stride length and slows it down and interferes with breathing. The integral role of ribs in both locomotion and breathing is likely why we dont see much variation in the shape of ribs, Dr. Lyson said. Ribs are generally pretty boring bones. The ribs of whales, snakes, dinosaurs, humans, and pretty much all other animals look the same. Turtles are the one exception, where they are highly modified to form the majority of the shell, he added. A breakthrough came with the discovery of several well preserved specimens of Eunotosaurus africanus, the earliest known 260 million year old turtle. New fossil material of the oldest hypothesized stem turtle, Eunotosaurus africanus from the Karoo Basin of South Africa, indicates the initiation of rib broadening was an adaptive response to fossoriality burrowing, Dr. Lyson and co authors explained. Similar to extant fossorial taxa, the broad ribs of Eunotosaurus africanus provide an intrinsically stable base on which to operate a powerful forelimb digging mechanism. The adaptations related to fossoriality likely facilitated movement of proto turtles into aquatic environments early in the groups evolutionary history, and this ecology may have played an important role in proto turtles surviving the PermianTriassic extinction event, the scientists said. Their findings were published online July 14 in the journal Current Biology.

The newly discovered dinosaur lived during the Upper Cretaceous epoch in what is now northern Patagonia, Argentina. The creature, which has been named Gualicho shinyae, was a medium sized predator and weighed around 450 kg 1,000 pounds, comparable to a polar bear. Fossil remains of the dinosaur were found in rocks from the Huincul Formation, which has yielded many specimens of sauropod and theropod dinosaurs. Gualicho shinyae belongs to a group of medium to large bipedal theropod dinosaurs known as allosaurids Allosauridae. The dinosaur is very different from the other dinosaurs that lived near it. It looks most like Deltadromeus, a meat eating theropod dinosaur with slender arms found in northern Africa. Despite its large size, Gualicho shinyaes forelimbs were the size of a human childs, and like the famous theropod dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex, it had just two digits  thumb and forefinger. Gualicho shinyae is kind of a mosaic dinosaur, it has features that you normally see in different kinds of theropods, said team member Dr. Peter Makovicky, of the Field Museum. Its really unusual  its different from the other carnivorous dinosaurs found in the same rock formation, and it doesnt fit neatly into any category. While Gualicho shinyae doesnt explain why so many theropod dinosaurs had reduced forelimbs, it adds to evidence that the trait evolved independently numerous times. By learning more about how reduced forelimbs evolved, we may be able to figure out why they evolved, Dr. Makovicky said. Dr. Makovicky and co authors have documented their discovery in a paper published in the journal PLoS ONE.

The ancient bird, named Calciavis grandei, is believed to be roughly the size of a chicken and was mostly ground dwelling, only flying in short bursts to escape predators. This is among one of the earliest well represented bird species after the age of large dinosaurs, said co author Dr. Sterling Nesbitt, from Virginia Tech. The exceptionally well preserved specimen of Calciavis grandei dating from the Eocene epoch  with bones, feathers, and fossilized soft tissues  was found more than a decade ago in the Green River Formation, a former lake bed. The Eocene lake is best known for producing scores of complete fish skeleton fossils, but other fossils such as other birds, plants, crocodilians, turtles, bats, and mammals from an ecosystem 50 million years old. According to Dr. Nesbitt and his colleague, Prof. Julia Clarke from the American Museum of Natural History, Calciavis grandei belongs to the extinct group of early Palaeognathae birds, the Lithornithidae. The bird is a close relative of the modern day kiwis, ostriches, and tinamous now living in the southern continents. The new bird shows us that the bird group that includes the largest flightless birds of today had a much wider distribution and longer evolutionary history in North America, Dr. Nesbitt said. Back when Calciavis grandei was alive, it lived in a tropical environment that was rich with tropical life and this is in stark contrast to the high desert environment in Wyoming today. After tropical forests disappeared in North America, Calciavis grandei and other more tropical birds went extinct, the paleontologists said. Relationships among species in this lineage of birds have been extremely contentious. We hope the detailed new anatomical data we provide will aid finding a resolution to this ongoing debate.

The dinosaur fossil, estimated to be 69 67 million years old Cretaceous period, was discovered in an outcrop of the Sinpetru Formation along the banks of the Sibisel River, in the Ha\u0163eg County Dinosaurs Geopark, western Romania. The specimen is represented by a pair of well preserved, associated lower jaws belonging to a sub adult individual of the hadrosauroid dinosaur Telmatosaurus transsylvanicus. It provides the first evidence of a pathological condition previously unrecognized in the dinosaurian fossil record. This discovery is the first ever described in the fossil record and the first to be thoroughly documented in a dwarf dinosaur, said Katharine Acheson, a PhD student at the University of Southampton and co author of the study, published in the journal Scientific Reports. Telmatosaurus is known to be close to the root of the duck billed dinosaur family tree, and the presence of such a deformity early in their evolution provides us with further evidence that the duck billed dinosaurs were more prone to tumors than other dinosaurs. It was obvious that the fossil was deformed when it was found more than a decade ago but what caused the outgrowth remained unclear until now, said co author Dr. Zolt\u00e1n Csiki Sava, from the University of Bucharest, Romania. It is unlikely that the tumor caused the dinosaur any serious pain during its early stages of development, just as in humans with the same condition, but the paleontologists can tell from its size that this particular dinosaur died before it reached adulthood. We know from modern examples that predators often attack a member of the herd that looks a little different or is even slightly disabled by a disease, Dr. Csiki Sava said. The tumor in this dinosaur had not developed to its full extent at the moment it died, but it could have indirectly contributed to its early demise. The particular make up of the rocks allowed us to identify that this fossil was preserved near the channel of an ancient river, Acheson added. In a setting like this, it is extremely rare to find the complete specimen, and so it is almost impossible to determine the specific cause of death. One can only make an informed guess based upon the evidence we have. The discovery of an ameloblastoma in a duck billed dinosaur documents that we have more in common with dinosaurs than previously realized, said co author Dr. Bruce Rothschild, from the Northeast Ohio Medical University.

The discovery was detailed in a paper published this week in the journal Current Biology. Stem cells  self renewing cells responsible for the formation of multicellular organisms  are located in plants at the tips of shoots and roots. The 320 million year old stem cells discovered by the team, which gave rise to the roots of an ancient plant, were found in a fossilized root tip from a Carboniferous coal swamp forest. As well as revealing the oldest plant root stem cells identified to date, the research also marks the first time an actively growing fossilized root has been discovered  in effect, an ancient plant frozen in time. Prof. Dolan and his colleagues have named the stem cell fossil Radix carbonica Latin for coal root. The Carboniferous stem cells are different to all those living today, with a unique pattern of cell division that remained unknown until now. That tells paleontologists that some of the mechanisms controlling root formation in plants and trees have now become extinct and may have been more diverse than thought. These roots were important because they comprised the rooting structures of the plants growing in the Earths first global tropical wetland forests with tall trees over 160 feet 50 m in height and were in part responsible for one of the most dramatic climate change events in history. The evolution of deep rooting systems increased the rate of chemical weathering of silicate minerals in rocks  a chemical reaction that pulled carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, leading to the cooling of the Earth and thus one of the planets great Ice ages. These fossils demonstrate how the roots of these ancient plants grew for the first time. It is startling that something so small could have had such a dramatic effect on the Earths climate, Prof. Dolan said.

The results were published this week in the journal PLoS ONE. Termites are among the most diverse and ecologically important groups of insects in modern ecosystems, playing a critical role as natural decomposers of plant tissues. Members of the termite subfamily Macrotermitinae cultivate fungi of the genus Termitomyces in so called gardens in underground nests or chambers, helping to convert plant material into a more easily digestible termite food source. Scientists had previously used DNA from modern termites to estimate the origin of fungus farming behavior back to at least 25 to 30 million years ago Oligocene epoch, when domestication of the ancestor of Termitomyces by the ancestor of the Macrotermitinae occurred. The fossil evidence from Tanzanias Great Rift Valley confirmed that date, allowing paleontologists to more accurately characterize the timing and evolution of the symbiotic relationship between termites and fungi. The relationship likely significantly modified the environment and landscape. The origin of this behavior likely had a profound effect on how nutrients were concentrated across the landscape, influencing the evolution of Africas biota, said co author Dr. Nancy Stevens, from Ohio University. The transition to agriculture dramatically increased the range of possible habitats for both the fungus growing termites and their domesticated fungi, very much like humans and their domesticated crops and livestock, tens of millions of years later, added co author Dr. Duur Aanen, from Wageningen University in the Netherlands. While the cradle of termite agriculture presumably was in an African rainforest, the transition to fungiculture helped the termites to disperse to less favorable dry savannas and also out of Africa migrations into Asia. The phenomenon might have been triggered by the initial development of the Great Rift Valley in this part of eastern Africa, and the dramatic transformation of the landscape around this time, said lead author Dr. Eric Roberts, from James Cook University in Townsville, Queensland, Australia.

The Nottinghamshire fossil is from the Early Jurassic and only several species of ichthyosaurs are known from this period, making the discovery very significant. The fossil had been in the collections of Leicesters New Walk Museum for more than 60 years until University of Manchester paleontologist Dean Lomax spotted unique features. The specimen is relatively complete, consisting of a partial skeleton including a skull, pectoral bones, limbs, pelvis bones, ribs and vertebrae. However, the bones are disorderly  it appears that the carcass nosedived into the seabed before it became fossilized, which may have restricted previous study. When I first saw this specimen, I knew it was unusual. It displays features in the bones  especially in the coracoid part of the pectoral girdle  that I had not seen before in Jurassic ichthyosaurs anywhere in the world, Mr. Lomax said. The specimen had never been published, so this rather unusual individual had been awaiting detailed examination. Parts of the skeleton had previously been on long term loan to ichthyosaur specialist and former museum curator Dr. Robert Appleby, and had only returned to the museum in 2004 after he sadly passed away, said Dr. Mark Evans, a paleontologist and curator of natural sciences at New Walk Museum. He was clearly intrigued by the specimen, and although he worked on it for many years, he had identified it as a previously known species but never published his findings. Mr. Lomax has named the new species Wahlisaurus massarae in honor of paleontologists Prof. Judy Massare and Bill Wahl who have contributed significantly to the study of ichthyosaurs, and who first introduced Mr. Lomax to studying them. Both Judy and Bill have been tremendous mentors for me, he said. They have significantly contributed to paleontology, especially the study of ichthyosaurs, and I cannot think of a better way to remember them by naming this new ichthyosaur in their honor. Their names will be set in stone forever, pun intended. A research paper describing Wahlisaurus massarae was published online this week in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. According to Mr. Lomax, Wahlisaurus is the first new genus of ichthyosaur from the British Early Jurassic to be described since 1986. The new species is also important for our understanding of ichthyosaur species diversity, and their geographical distribution during the Early Jurassic.

The study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, questioned the familiar story that dinosaurs dominated their prehistoric environment, while ancient mammals took a backseat, until the dinosaurs went extinct 66 million years ago, allowing mammals to shine. The traditional view is that mammals were suppressed during the age of the dinosaurs and underwent a rapid diversification immediately following the extinction of the dinosaurs, said study co author Elis Newham, a PhD student at the University of Southampton. However, our findings were that therian mammals were already diversifying considerably before the extinction event and the event also had a considerably negative impact on mammal diversity. The old hypothesis hinged upon the fact that many of the early mammal fossils that had been found were from small, insect eating animals  there didnt seem to be much in the way of diversity. However, over the years, more and more early mammals have been found, including some hoofed animal predecessors the size of dogs. The animals teeth were varied too. Newham and his colleague David Grossnickle, a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago, analyzed the molars of hundreds of early mammal specimens. They found that the mammals that lived during the years leading up to the dinosaurs demise had widely varied tooth shapes, meaning that they had widely varied diets. These different diets proved key to an unexpected finding regarding mammal species going extinct along with the dinosaurs. Not only did mammals begin diversifying earlier than previously expected, but the mass extinction wasnt the perfect opportunity for mammal evolution that its traditionally been painted as. Early mammals were hit by a selective extinction at the same time the dinosaurs died out. The team was surprised to see that mammals were initially negatively impacted by the mass extinction event. I fully expected to see more diverse mammals immediately after the extinction, Grossnickle said. I wasnt expecting to see any sort of drop. It didnt match the traditional view that after the extinction, mammals hit the ground running. Its part of the reason why I went back to study it further  it seemed wrong. The reason behind the mammals pre extinction diversification remains a mystery. The scientists suggest a possible link between the rise of mammals and the rise of flowering plants, which diversified around the same time. We cant know for sure, but flowering plants might have offered new seeds and fruits for the mammals. And, if the plants co evolved with new insects to pollinate them, the insects could have also been a food source for early mammals, Grossnickle said. The study is particularly relevant in light of the mass extinction the earth is currently undergoing. The types of survivors that made it across the mass extinction 66 million years ago, mostly generalists, might be indicative of what will survive in the next hundred years, the next thousand.

In the 1970s, studies suggested that an ice free corridor along the Rocky Mountains might have been the pathway for the first movement of humans southward from Alaska to colonize the rest of the Americas. More recent evidence, however, indicated that the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets coalesced at the height of the last Ice Age, around 21,000 years ago, closing the corridor much earlier than any evidence of humans south of the ice sheets. The initial southward movement of people into the Americas more than 15,000 years ago now seems likely to have been via a Pacific coastal route, but the ice free corridor has remained of interest as a potential route for later migrations. A team of scientists led by Prof. Duane Froese from the University of Alberta and Prof. Beth Shapiro from the University of California, Santa Cruz, combined radiocarbon dating and DNA analysis to track the movements of bison Bison sp. into the corridor, showing that it was fully open by about 13,000 years ago. Their findings indicate that the corridor could not account for the initial dispersal of humans south of the ice sheets, but could have been used for later movements of people and animals, both northward and southward. What weve done is put some fairly strong constraints on when this area was viable, and when it was connected to the north and the south in terms of it being a corridor, Prof. Froese said. Previous work by Prof. Shapiro had shown that the bison populations north and south of the ice sheets were genetically distinct by the time the corridor opened. By analyzing bison fossils from within the corridor region, the team was able track the movement of northern bison southward into the corridor and southern bison northward. To infer the chronology of the corridor linking Beringia and interior North America, we generated radiocarbon dates from 78 North American bison fossils, 49 of which were recovered from the corridor region, they explained. Sites included Clover Bar and Charlie Lake Cave in western Canada, both of which previously yielded dates in the time frame of interest 11,500 13,500 years before present. The radiocarbon dates told us how old the fossils were, but the key thing was the genetic analysis, because that told us when bison from the northern and southern populations were able to meet within the corridor, said study first author Dr. Peter Heintzman, from the University of California, Santa Cruz. The results, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, showed that the southern part of the ice free corridor opened first, allowing southern bison to start moving northward as early as 13,400 years ago, before the corridor fully opened. Later, there was some movement of northern bison southward, with the two populations overlapping in the corridor by 13,000 years ago. There were established indigenous populations both in central Alaska and south of the ice masses before 14,000 years ago this new information shows that before 13,000 years ago, bison  and therefore, likely people  could move between these two regions, previously separated by a glacial barrier, said co author Dr. Prof. John Ives, from the University of Alberta. The amount of northward movement was a surprise to researchers, who expected to find predominantly southward migration patterns. This removes this very limited idea of this corridor as simply a route for the very first North Americans, to now suggest a much richer history  that it was used multiple times by populations likely moving in both directions, Prof. Froese said.

The new species is named Ceratomyrmex ellenbergeri and belongs to the tribe Haidomyrmecini, possibly the earliest ant lineage. Ceratomyrmex ellenbergeri lived during the Creataceous period, 99 million years ago, according to lead co author Dr. Bo Wang of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology and his colleagues. Workers of this ant species had a prominent horn and oversized, scythelike mandibles. Ceratomyrmex ellenbergeri differs from all other extinct and living ants by the presence, in workers, of a long cephalic horn arising from between the antennal insertions and curved forward and by very long, scythe like mandibles, their tips reaching above head near to the horns apex, Dr. Wang and co authors explained. The scientists think that these head structures functioned as a highly specialized trap for large bodied prey. Haidomyrmecine ants were probably solitary specialist predators, they said. Soon after the advent of ant societies in the Early Cretaceous, at least one lineage, the Haidomyrmecini, became adept at prey capture, independently arriving at morphological specializations that would be lost for millions of years after their disappearance near the close of the Mesozoic. The well preserved specimens of Ceratomyrmex ellenbergeri were found in four different pieces of amber from the Hukawng Valley in northern Myanmar also known as Burma.

The new family has been named Malleodectidae malleodectids, from the word for hammer in Latin and biter in Ancient Greek, referring to the presence of an enormous premolar that was clearly used for crushing hard food items. Malleodectids were about the size of ferret and are known only from fossils from the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in far northern Australia. Isolated teeth and partial dentitions of these strange marsupials had been unearthed over the years at Riversleigh, where Prof. Archer and his colleagues have excavated for several decades. But the profoundly different nature of the malleodectid marsupials was not realized until a well preserved portion of the skull of a juvenile was found in a 15 million year old cave deposit. This specimen was only recently extracted from its limestone casing. The young malleodectid still had its baby teeth, and was teething, with adult teeth that had been about to erupt when it was alive still embedded in its jaw. Details of the canine, premolar and molar teeth of this specimen have enabled its relationships to other Australian marsupials to be determined with reasonable confidence, Prof. Archer explained. According to the team, malleodectids were probably related to living Australian carnivorous marsupials such as quolls, the Tasmanian devil and the marsupial anteater or numbat, as well as the recently extinct thylacine or Tasmanian tiger. However, malleodectids represent a lineage of marsupials that has been distinct since at least 23 million years ago. Discovering an entirely new family of marsupials is really remarkable  the discovery of such a weird animal just goes to show that we have much, much more to find about the evolution of mammals, said co author Dr. Robin Beck, from the University of Salford.

These data are consistent with a catastrophic driver for the extinction, such as bolide impact, rather than a significant contribution from Deccan Traps volcanism during the late Maastrichtian. The research, published in the May 26 issue of the journal Nature Communications, involved a long term process of identifying more than 6,000 marine fossils ranging in age from 69  to 65 million years old. This enormous collection, excavated by paleontologists on Seymour Island in the Antarctic Peninsula, includes a wide range of species  from small snails and clams that lived on the sea floor to large and unusual creatures that swam in the surface waters of the ocean. These include Diplomoceras, an ammonite with a paperclip shaped shell that could grow as large as 2 m, and massive marine reptiles such as Mosasaurus. Antarctic rocks contain a truly exceptional assemblage of fossils that have yielded new and surprising information about the evolution of life 66 million years ago, said co author Prof. Jane Francis, from the British Antarctic Survey. Even the animals that lived at the ends of the Earth close to the South Pole were not safe from the devastating effects of the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period. With the fossils grouped by age, the collection shows a dramatic 65 70 reduction in the number of species living in the Antarctic 66 million years ago  coinciding exactly with the time when the dinosaurs and many other groups of organisms worldwide became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous. Previously, paleontologists had thought that creatures living near the Poles were far enough away from the cause of the end Cretaceous extinction to be badly affected  whether this was an asteroid impact in the Gulf of Mexico, where a giant buried impact crater is found today, or extreme volcanism in the Deccan volcanic province in India.

Ichthyosaurs were a successful group of marine animals that flourished in the worlds oceans of the Mesozoic era. Most of them looked a little bit like todays dolphins. They were well adapted to feed in water, with a long, narrow, and often graceful snout armed with teeth. But the new species, scientifically named Sclerocormus parviceps, is a strange anomaly in the ichthyosaur world. It measured about 5.3 feet 1.6 m long, including a 3 foot 92\u2009cm long tail. It had a short snout and, instead of a tail with triangular flukes think of a fishs tail fins, it had a long, whip like tail without big fins at the end. And while many ichthyosaurs had conical teeth for catching prey, the new species was toothless and instead seems to have used its short snout to create pressure and suck up food like a syringe. Sclerocormus parviceps tells us that ichthyosauriforms evolved and diversified rapidly at the end of the Lower Triassic period, said Dr. Olivier Rieppel of the Field Museum. We dont have many marine reptile fossils from this period, so this specimen is important because it suggests that theres diversity that hasnt been uncovered yet. The way Sclerocormus parviceps evolved into such a different form so quickly sheds light on how evolution actually works. It has been considered that early Mesozoic marine reptiles evolved slowly in the Early Triassic after the end Permian mass extinction, contrary to the fast radiation of most metazoans during the same time interval, Dr. Rieppel and co authors said. The present and other recent discoveries of Early Triassic marine reptiles indicate that the diversification of Triassic marine reptiles was not a single phase of unbroken increase in diversity. There were at least two waves of marine reptile diversification, separated by a taxonomic bottleneck near the Early Middle Triassic boundary. Marine reptiles like Sclerocormus parviceps that lived just after the end Permian mass extinction also reveal how life responds to huge environmental pressures. Were in a mass extinction right now, not one caused by volcanoes or meteorites, but by humans, Dr. Rieppel said. So while the extinction 250 million years ago wont tell us how to solve whats going on today, it does bear on the evolutionary theory at work. Research describing the new species is published online in the journal Scientific Reports.

The species, named Spiclypeus shipporum by Dr. Jordan Mallon from the Canadian Museum of Nature and co authors who documented it, lived in North America about 76 million years back. Spiclypeus is a combination of two Latin words meaning spiked shield, referring to the impressive head frill and triangular spikes that adorn its margins, the scientists explained. The name shipporum honors the Shipp family, on whose land the fossil was found near Winifred, Montana. Spiclypeus shipporum belonged to a group of dinosaurs called ceratopsids Ceratopsidae, which were herbivorous dinosaurs with horns and huge neck frills. Ceratopsidae is a clade of megaherbivorous dinosaurs that arose during the Late Cretaceous and rapidly diversified in Asia and North America to become one of the most speciose dinosaur groups of their time, Dr. Mallon and co authors said. Ceratopsids are most easily distinguished by their horned crania and expansive parietosquamosal frills, which were typically ornamented for display. About half of Spiclypeus shipporums skull, as well as parts of the dinosaurs legs, hips and backbone had been preserved in the silty hillside that once formed part of an ancient floodplain. What sets this species apart from other ceratopsids such as Triceratops is the orientation of the horns over the eyes, which stick out sideways from the skull. There is also a unique arrangement to the bony spikes that emanate from the margin of the frill  some of the spikes curl forward while others project outward. This dinosaur is special because of the shape of its horns and frill. The sideways projection of the brow horns is uncommon, and the arrangement of the frill spikes is unique near the midline they curl forward, while the others radiate outward, the paleontologists said. Spiclypeus shipporum is transitional between more primitive forms in which all the spikes at the back of the frill radiate outward, and those such as Kosmoceratops in which they all curl forward, Dr. Mallon said. The remains also tell us much about this individuals life history, which was rife with suffering  an upper arm bone shows significant deformities from arthritis and osteomyelitis bone infection. If you look near the elbow, you can see great openings that developed to drain an infection, Dr. Mallon said. We dont know how the bone became infected, but we can be sure that it caused the animal great pain for years and probably made its left forelimb useless for walking. Despite this trauma, analysis of the annual growth rings inside the dinosaurs bones by the team suggests it lived to maturity. The dinosaur would have been at least 10 years old when it died. There are now nine well known dinosaur species  including Spiclypeus shipporum  from Montanas Judith River Formation, the scientists said. Some are also found in Alberta, which has a much richer fossil record, but others such as Spiclypeus shipporum are unique to Montana. None of the species are shared with more southerly states, suggesting that dinosaur faunas in western North America were highly localized about 76 million years ago. The results were published online May 18, 2016 in the journal PLoS ONE.

Fossilized remains of the ancient dog, which was named Cynarctus wangi, were recovered from the Choptank Formation Chesapeake Group of Maryland. According to the authors, Steven Jasinski from the University of Pennsylvania and Prof. Steven Wallace from East Tennessee State University, Cynarctus wangi was a member of the extinct subfamily Borophaginae, commonly known as bone crushing dogs because of their powerful jaws and broad teeth. In this respect they are believed to have behaved in a similar way to hyenas today, Jasinski said. Borophagine dogs were widespread and diverse in North America from 30 to 10 million years ago. The last members went extinct around 2 millions years ago. Cynarctus wangi represents one of the last surviving borophagines and was likely outcompeted by ancestors of some of the canines living today wolves, coyotes and foxes. Despite its strong jaws, the team believes Cynarctus wangi wouldnt have been wholly reliant on meat to sustain itself. Based on its teeth, probably only about a third of its diet would have been meat, Jasinski explained. It would have supplemented that by eating plants or insects, living more like a mini bear than like a dog. Although Cynarctus wangi represents the first known carnivore from the Choptank Formation, some of the animals that it would have lived beside are known. These include the ancient pigs Desmathyus and Prosthenops, the horned artiodactyl Prosynthetoceras, an ancient elephant like animal known as a gomphothere, and perhaps the ancient horse Merychippus. This new dog gives us useful insight into the ecosystem of eastern North America between 12 and 13 million years ago, Jasinski said. The research was detailed online in the Journal of Paleontology.

Sometimes referred to as the ancient bison, Bison antiquus is a direct ancestor of the extant American bison Bison bison. The species arrived in North America approximately 250,000 years ago from eastern Asia and eventually ranged from Florida to Oregon. It disappeared from the Mid South around 10,000 years ago, finally dying out around 5,000 years ago. According to paleontologists, Bison antiquus was approximately 8 feet 2.4 m tall, 15 feet 4.6 m long and weighed close to 1,600 kg. The newly discovered bones of this species were found just 10 feet 3 m below the grounds surface during the final stretch of the 2016 excavation efforts at the Old Vero Man site. The Florida Atlantic University scientists identified Bison antiquus using an upper molar. This finding is especially significant because of the meticulous documentation that has been involved, said principal investigator Dr. James Adovasio. Along with the fact that bones like this have never been found on land as part of a calculated archaeological effort. Others like this have all been found underwater, in sinkholes or streams. Team member Dr. Andrew Hemmings added we couldnt have asked for a better representative species from that era.We now know that people were here in Vero Beach at that time."}, {"title": " Atopodentatus unicus: Earth\u2019s Earliest Herbivorous Marine Reptile", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "May 9, 2016", "doc": "Nearly two years ago, an international team of paleontologists discovered a bizarre fossil  Atopodentatus unicus, a 10 feet 3 m long marine reptile that lived in what is now China 247 to 242 million years ago Middle Triassic. Atopodentatus unicus head was poorly preserved, but it seemed to have a flamingo like beak. But according to a new paper, published in the journal Science Advances, that beak is actually part of a hammerhead shaped jaw apparatus, which Atopodentatus unicus used to feed on plants on the ocean floor. Its the earliest known example of a plant eating marine reptile. The wide jaw of Atopodentatus unicus was shaped like a hammerhead, and along the edge, it had peg like teeth. Then, further into its mouth, it had bunches of needle like teeth, said co author Dr. Olivier Rieppel from Field Museum in Chicago. That arrangement wouldnt have been too useful for chewing prey. To figure out how Atopodentatus unicus jaw fit together and how the reptile actually fed, the scientists bought some childrens clay and rebuilt it with toothpicks to represent the teeth. We looked at how the upper and lower jaw locked together, and thats how we proceeded and described it, Dr. Rieppel said. The verdict Atopodentatus unicus used its bizarre jaw to help it eat plants. Atopodentatus unicus used its front teeth to nip algae or other plants from rocky surfaces and then, with its mouth closed, forced mouthfuls of water through its side teeth, which acted as a filter trapping the plants and letting the water back out, like how whales filter feed with their baleen, Dr. Rieppel explained. Not only does this discovery solve the mystery of the strange toothed Atopodentatus unicus, but it also provides us with an example of the first herbivorous marine reptile. The jaw structure is clearly that of an herbivore. It has similarities to other marine animals that ate plants with a filter feeding system, but Atopodentatus unicus is older than them by about 8 million years, Dr. Rieppel said. This reptile also helps tell a bigger story about the worlds largest mass extinction 252 million years ago. Animals living the years surrounding the Permian Triassic extinction help us see how life on Earth reacted to that event, Dr. Rieppel said. The existence of specialized animals like Atopodentatus unicus shows us that life recovered and diversified more quickly than previously thought. And its definitely a reptile that no one would have thought to exist.

According to scientists, primates are sensitive to shifts in temperature, and thus, to climate change. Changes in the distribution of primate fossils throughout time reflect this, with intervals of extreme warmth corresponding to expansions for these species, as reflected in the fossil record, and cooler periods  such as the Eocene Oligocene transition EOT, some 34 million years ago  resulting in primates extinction on large scales. At the Eocene Oligocene boundary, because of the rearrangement of Earths major tectonic plates, you had a rapid drop in temperature and humidity, said study co author Dr. K. Christopher Beard, from the University of Kansas. Primates like it warm and wet, so they faced hard times around the world  to the extent that they went extinct in North America and Europe. Of course, primates somehow survived in Africa and Southern Asia, because were still around to talk about it. Assessing the exact impact of EOT environmental changes on Asian primate evolution has been difficult given the lack of primate fossils from the region during that time. To fill this gap, Dr. Beard and his colleagues studied the fossils of ten extinct primate species from Yunnan Province dated to the early Oligocene, the time just after the cooler transition, discovering that surviving the EOT required primates to adapt to lemur like strepsirrhine primates. Like most of todays primates, the ancient Chinese primates were tropical tree dwellers, Dr. Beard said. One of the species, Oligotarsius rarus, was incredibly similar to the modern tarsier found today only in the Philippine and Indonesian islands. If you look back at the fossil record, we know that tarsiers once lived on mainland Asia, as far north as central China. The fossil teeth described in this paper are nearly identical to those of modern tarsiers. Research shows that modern tarsiers are pretty much living fossils  those things have been doing what they do ever since time immemorial, as far as we can tell. A similar comparison of Afro Arabia fossils shows a very different pattern of adaptation in response to the EOT very few strepsirrhines a suborder of primates that includes lemurs survived, whereas anthropoids monkeys and apes diversified. The results suggest that the EOT functioned as a critical filtering episode during the evolutionary history of Asian primates, one that ultimately impacted the course of primate evolution across the Old World.

Sarmientosaurus musacchioi roamed what is now Argentina approximately 95 million years ago in the Upper Cretaceous epoch, Dr. Mart\u00ednez and his colleagues believe. An exceptionally well preserved skull and neck fossil of this new dinosaur was unearthed in the Bajo Barreal Formation of southern Chubut Province, central Patagonia. According to the scientists, Sarmientosaurus musacchioi is the first titanosaurian sauropod from southern South America for which a virtually complete adult skull has been discovered. Using CT scans, they found that the Sarmientosaurus brain was small relative to its enormous body, typical of sauropod dinosaurs. However, they also found evidence of greater sensory capabilities than most other sauropods. Sarmientosaurus musacchioi possesses a number of distinctive features that have not been observed in other sauropods, the paleontologists said. The cranial endocast presents among the most complete information about the brain and sensory systems for any sauropod, let alone titanosaurs, and thus will be important for the developing picture of neural evolution in Sauropoda. They suggest that this titanosaur had large eyeballs and good vision, and its inner ear may have been better tuned for hearing low frequency airborne sounds compared to other titanosaurs. Moreover, the balance organ of the inner ear indicates that this dinosaur may have habitually held its head with the snout facing downward, possibly to feed primarily on low growing plants. Discoveries like Sarmientosaurus musacchioi happen once in a lifetime, said Dr. Mart\u00ednez, who is the lead author of a report published this week on Sarmientosaurus musacchioi in the journal PLoS ONE. Thats why we studied the fossils so thoroughly, to learn as much about this amazing animal as we could. Sarmientosaurus musacchioi is named for the town of Sarmiento in Chubut Province, which is close to the discovery site, the scientists said. The species name also honors the late Prof. Eduardo Musacchio, a paleontologist at the National University of the Patagonia San Juan Bosc and friend to Dr. Mart\u00ednez and other team members. "}, {"title": " Dinosaurs Left Europe during Early Cretaceous, Says New Study", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 25, 2016", "doc": "A team of paleontologists led by University of Leeds scientist Dr. Alexander Dunhill has used the so called Network Theory to visually depict the movement of dinosaurs around the world during the Mesozoic era 252 to 66 million years ago  including a curious exodus from Europe during the Early Cretaceous 146 to 100 million years ago. While Network Theory is commonly used in computer science for quantifying internet data, such as friend connections on Facebook, it has only recently been applied to biology research and this is the first study to use it to on dinosaur research. Network Theory has been studied in physics for a number of years, however it is finally permeating into other disciplines, said team member Dr. James Sciberras, from the University of Bath. This idea that most things can, and should, be considered in the context of the whole system will lead to some exciting new findings in a wide range of fields. Dr. Dunhill and his teams research reaffirms previous studies that have found that dinosaurs continued to migrate to all parts of the world after the supercontinent Pangaea split into land masses that are separated by oceans. We presume that temporary land bridges formed due to changes in sea levels, temporarily reconnecting the continents, Dr. Dunhill said. Such massive structures  spanning, for example, from Indo Madagascar to Australia  may be hard to imagine. But over the timescales that we are talking about, which is in the order of tens of millions of years, it is perfectly feasible that plate tectonic activity gave rise to the right conditions for such land bridges to form. The paleontologists used the Paleobiology Database that contains every documented and accessible dinosaur fossil from around the world. Fossil records for the same dinosaur families from different continents were then cross mapped for different periods of time, revealing connections that show how they have migrated. Some regions of the world, such as Europe, have extensive fossil records from a long history of palaeontology digs, while other parts of the world have been largely unexplored. To help account for this disparity in fossil records, which could otherwise skew the findings, the team applied a filter to the database records to only count the first time that a dinosaur family connection occurred between two continents. The findings, published online today in the Journal of Biogeography, support the idea that, although continental splitting undoubtedly reduced intercontinental migration of dinosaurs, it did not completely inhibit it. Surprisingly, the study also showed that all connections between Europe and other continents during the Early Cretaceous were out going. This is a curious result that has no concrete explanation, Dr. Dunhill said. It might be a real migratory pattern or it may be an artifact of the incomplete and sporadic nature of the dinosaur fossil record. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists: Seed Diet May Have Played Key Role in Survival of Early Birds", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 22, 2016", "doc": "Ecological changes following the dinosaur ravaging Chicxulub impact 65 million years ago may have been more detrimental to meat eating bird like dinosaurs, and early birds with toothless beaks were able to survive on seeds when other food sources declined, according to a team of paleontologists writing in the journal Current Biology this week. The small bird like dinosaurs in the Cretaceous, the maniraptoran dinosaurs, are not a well understood group. Theyre some of the closest relatives to modern birds, and at the end of the Cretaceous, many went extinct, including the toothed birds  but modern crown group birds managed to survive the extinction, said team member Dr. Derek Larson, of the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum. Why did that difference occur when these groups were so similar? Dr. Larson and co authors began by investigating whether the extinction at the end of the Cretaceous was an abrupt event or a progressive decline simply capped off by the Chicxulub impact. The fossil record holds evidence to support both scenarios, depending on which dinosaurs are being examined. Delving into the bird like dinosaurs, the scientists collected data describing 3,104 fossilized teeth from four different maniraptoran families. We examined tooth morphology, an ecological indicator in fossil reptiles, from over 3,100 maniraptoran teeth from four groups Troodontidae, Dromaeosauridae, Richardoestesia, and Aves across the last 18 million years of the Cretaceous, they explained. If the variation between teeth decreased over time, this loss of diversity would indicate that the ecosystem was declining and may have paralleled a long term species loss. If the teeth maintained their differences over time, however, that would indicate a rich and stable ecosystem over millions of years and suggest that these bird like dinosaurs were abruptly killed off by an event at the end of the Cretaceous. In the end, the tooth data favored the latter interpretation. The maniraptoran dinosaurs maintained a very steady level of variation through the last 18 million years of the Cretaceous. They abruptly became extinct just at the boundary, Dr. Larson said. The paleontologists suspected that diet might have played a part in the survival of the lineage that produced modern day birds, and they used dietary information and previously published group relationships from birds to infer what their ancestors might have eaten. They hypothesized that the last common ancestor of modern birds was a toothless seed eater with a beak.

Rapetosaurus krausei is a member of the dinosaur group Titanosauria that lived in Madagascar from 70 to 66 million years ago, at the end of the Cretaceous period. The species is estimated to have reached a maximum length of about 50 feet 15 m. While several fossils of Rapetosaurus krausei have been analyzed to date, very little is known about this titanosaur around the time of hatching. Analysis of the new fossil by Dr. Curry Rogers and co authors suggests that the baby Rapetosaurus krausei they studied, who died between the age of 39 and 77 days, weighed roughly 3.4 kg when it hatched. Just several weeks later, when it likely succumbed to starvation in a drought stressed ecosystem, it had reached a mass of 40 kg and was 14 inches 35 cm tall at the hip. The team used bone histology and X ray computed tomography to understand its growth pattern. Histological and limb analysis suggest that this tiny giant had a much greater range of movement than it would have had as an adult, Dr. Curry Rogers and her colleagues said in a paper published this week in the journal Science. Furthermore, the work confirms hypotheses that these largest of dinosaurs were precocial, being able to move independently immediately after birth. This pattern differs from that seen in many contemporary dinosaur groups, such as theropods and ornithischians, for which increasing evidence suggests that parental care was important.

The teams study, published online in the journal PLoS ONE, provides a long sought insight about gavialoids  a diversified group of mostly extinct long snouted crocodilian species  that are represented today by just one living species, the Indian gharial Gavialis gangeticus. The scientists, led by Dr. Rodolfo Salas Gismondi from the University of Montpellier in France and the Natural History Museum in Peru, examined fossils from the 13 million year old Miocene epoch gavialoid crocodilian, the oldest known gavialoid from the Amazon. They named the new species Gryposuchus pachakamue after Pachakamue, a pre Hispanic South American storyteller god thought to have knowledge about the origins of South American life. The fossils came from the Pebas Formation in northeastern Peru, which was likely made up of swampy waterways, suggesting that the crocodilian had a river dwelling lifestyle. It had only slightly telescoped eyes. Gryposuchus pachakamue was distinct from all the other crocodiles living in the vast Pebas Mega Wetlands of northern South America, Dr. Salas Gismondi said. It was the only long snouted species within a hyper diverse crocodile community dominated by blunt snouted, clam eating caimans. Dr. Salas Gismondi and his colleagues conducted phylogenetic and morphometric analysis to assess the likely evolutionary development of the protruding telescoped eyes of Indian and South American species. Their analysis suggested that Gryposuchus pachakamue represents the ancestral condition from which the South American lineage evolved telescoped eyes. The eyes therefore evolved in parallel in South American and Indian lineages, at first showing partial telescoping as in Gryposuchus pachakamue, and eventually becoming fully telescoped as seen in later evolving species. Both South American and Indian gavialoids adopted a river dwelling lifestyle, and it is likely that telescoped eyes were adaptive, helping them to catch fish in these habitats.

The Miocene epoch 23.85.3 million years ago is marked by substantial climatic and ecological changes that had profound effects on terrestrial mammal communities in the New World tropics, Dr. Bloch and his colleagues said. Fossils from the tropical lowlands of Central America are rare owing to a lack of relevant rock exposures however, an important exception can be found in Panama where, since 2009, expansion of the Panama Canal has exposed fossil bearing rocks of early Miocene age. The scientists found the 20.9 million year old teeth of a previously unknown monkey species in the Las Cascadas Formation during a five year intensive fossil salvage project. Most of the mammal groups represented in the Las Cascadas Formation have North American origins, supporting the idea that Central America and western Panama represented a long peninsula extending south from North America, they said. They named the newfound species Panamacebus transitus in honor of Panama and the monkeys movement across the ancient seaway that divided North and South America. We suggest that Panamacebus transitus was related to the capuchin and squirrel monkeys that are found in Central and South America today, Dr. Bloch said. Prior to this discovery, New World monkeys were thought to have evolved in isolation on South America, cut off from North America by a wide seaway. Before the teeth of Panamacebus transitus were discovered, the oldest evidence of movement of a mammal from South to North America are 8.5  9 million year old fossil remains of giant sloths. Dr. Bloch and co authors suggest two explanations i that mammals from South America were more adapted to life in the South American derived forests still found in Panama and Costa Rica than to other forest types characteristic of Northern Central America ii or that the lack of exposed fossil deposits throughout Central America means that evidence of these dispersals has yet to be revealed. Research describing the new species is published online in the journal Nature.

Giant bears greater than 800 1,000 kg roamed both North and South America during the Pleistocene, 2.5 million to 11,000 years ago. These animals belonged to a now practically extinct subfamily of bears, Tremarctinae, which is today only represented by the Andean spectacled bear Tremarctos ornatus, a largely herbivorous bear that is found in South America. The giant North American bears genus Arctodus and South American bears genus Arctotherium have long been believed to be each others closest relative. However, by comparing ancient mitochondrial DNA data obtained from representatives of the two extinct genera and comparing them with the living species, Dr. Mitchell and co authors were able to show that Arctotherium is most closely related to the Andean spectacled bear and not Arctodus. In this study, we sequenced a mitochondrial genome from an Arctotherium femur preserved in a Chilean cave, the scientists explained. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed that the South American short faced bears were more closely related to the extant South American spectacled bear than to the North American short faced bears. The implication of this result is that these bears represent a remarkable instance of convergent evolution, as giant bears appear to have evolved independently in both North and South America. This convergent evolution would have arisen in response to similar environmental conditions on both continents, most likely an abundance of large herbivore carcasses killed by smaller predators, which Arctodus and Arctotherium could effectively dominate, and a lack of competing scavengers, Dr. Mitchell and co authors said. The findings were published April 19, 2016 in the journal Biology Letters.

Whether dinosaurs were in decline before their final disappearance at the Cretaceous Paleogene K Pg mass extinction event 66 million years ago has been debated for decades with no clear resolution. By using a statistical analysis in conjunction with information from the fossil record, Dr. Sakamoto, Dr. Venditti, and their colleague, Prof. Mike Benton of the University of Bristol, showed that dinosaur species were going extinct at a faster pace than new ones were emerging from 50 million years before the Chicxulub cometasteroid hit. The analyses demonstrate that while the decline in species numbers over time was effectively ubiquitous among all three dinosaur groups Ornithischia, Sauropodomorpha, and Theropoda, their patterns of species loss were different. For instance, giant sauropod dinosaurs were in the fastest decline, whereas theropods, the group of dinosaurs that include T. rex, were in a more gradual decline. We find overwhelming support for a long term decline across all dinosaurs and within all three dinosaurian subclades, where speciation rate slowed down through time and was ultimately exceeded by extinction rate tens of millions of years before the K Pg boundary, the scientists said. The only exceptions to this general pattern are the morphologically specialized herbivores, the Hadrosauriformes and Ceratopsidae, which show rapid species proliferations throughout the Late Cretaceous instead. We were not expecting this result, Dr. Sakamoto said. While the cometasteroid impact is still the prime candidate for the dinosaurs final disappearance, it is clear that they were already past their prime in an evolutionary sense. All the evidence shows that the dinosaurs, which had already been around, dominating terrestrial ecosystems for 150 million years, somehow lost the ability to speciate fast enough, Prof. Benton said. This was likely to have contributed to their inability to recover from the environmental crisis caused by the impact. According to the team, the observed decline in dinosaurs would have had implications for other groups of species. The decline of the dinosaurs would have left plenty of room for mammals, the group of species which humans are a member of, to flourish before the impact, priming them to replace dinosaurs as the dominant animals on Earth, Dr. Venditti said.

The findings, published online March 4, 2016 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, are surprising dinosaurs and their close relatives had much more variation in growth patterns then ever expected, and this variation does not appear to be related to differences between males and females. According to the team, Asilisaurus kongwe belongs to Silesauridae, an extinct group of Triassic reptiles related to the dinosaurs. This reptile lived in what is now present day Tanzania. It was about the size of a Labrador retriever, had a long tail, and likely maxed at 30 kg. Fossils of the reptile are vital because a large number of specimens were found, largely intact and varying in size and age. In studying the anatomy and bone tissue of Asilisaurus kongwe and how individuals changed during growth, the paleontologists found that although these individual animals lived in roughly the same location at the same time, they grew differently. They compared this finding to any modern family with siblings and cousins differing in height or body mass, for instance, one brother smallish, and another taller one naturally muscular, another prone to thinness. They studied bone scars on the Asilisaurus kongwe leg bones, focusing on spots where muscles and tendons attach to bone. The more mature an individual was at death, the larger its bone scars appeared. As with any animal or person, an individual skeleton goes from possessing few scars to possessing many during life, with scars appearing in a particular order as the age of the individual increases. Findings show that except for the smallest and largest individuals, which are the least and most mature, size is a poor predictor of skeletal maturity in Asilisaurus kongwe, and therefore likely in early dinosaurs as well. Further, similar differences in early dinosaurs had been thought to represent a difference in sex, with more mature individuals representing one sex and more immature individuals representing another. Variation in muscle scars was thought to indicate sexual difference in early dinosaurs, but we know that in many modern animals these features are related to growth, not sex, said lead author Christopher Griffin, from the Virginia Polytechnic and State Universitys Department of Geosciences. Because of this, we thought that similar variations that we saw in Asilisaurus kongwe would not turn out to split into two groups, which would be evidence for a sex difference, and instead be more on a spectrum. As we looked at more Asilisaurus kongwe fossils of different sizes, because we had such a great sample size, we found this to be supported with a large sample size, they dont split into two clean groups. The earliest dinosaurs grew just like their closest relatives, and there are very few features that make dinosaurs unique from their closest relatives, said study co author Dr. Sterling Nesbitt, also from the Virginia Polytechnic and State Universitys Department of Geosciences.

The ancient creature, scientifically named Aquilonifer spinosus, lived about 430 million years ago Silurian period on the sea floor with a variety of other animals including sponges, brachiopods, worms, snails and other mollusks, a sea spider, a horseshoe crab, various shrimp like creatures, and a sea star. Its genus name comes from aquila, which means eagle or kite, and the suffix fer, which means carry. According to the team, led by Prof. Derek Briggs of Yale University and the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, Aquilonifer spinosus grew to less than half an inch long about one cm, and there is only one known fossil of the animal, found in Herefordshire, England. Ten juveniles of different stages of development were found attached to it with thin, flexible threads. The unusual parenting method is the only known example of its kind. The discovery was reported April 4, 2016 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. According to the scientists, Aquilonifer spinosus is a member of the arthropods, the large group of animals that includes insects, spiders and crustaceans. Many arthropods adopt different strategies to protect their young from predators, including attaching them to their limbs, holding them under their shell, or enclosing them within a special pouch until they are old enough to be released. Modern crustaceans employ a variety of strategies to protect their eggs and embryos from predators  attaching them to the limbs, holding them under the carapace, or enclosing them within a special pouch until they are old enough to be released  but this example is unique, Prof. Briggs said. Nothing is known today that attaches the young by threads to its upper surface. The adult Aquilonifer spinosus postponed molting until the juveniles were old enough to hatch otherwise, the juveniles would have been cast aside with the shed exoskeleton. The adults head is eyeless and covered by a shield like structure. We considered the possibility that the juveniles were parasites feeding off a host, but decided it was unlikely because the attachment position would not be favorable for accessing nutrients, Prof. Briggs said. This newly discovered strategy may have provided some benefits for the animal, said co author Dr. Mark Sutton, from Imperial College London. It could offer protection  the adult could have tried to fend off anything that wanted to eat the young, or carried them away from danger. The adult could also have moved the young to areas where they could access a better food supply. They were probably filter feeders, extracting nutrient particles from the water, so perhaps the adult could orient itself to any water currents to help with this.

This snakes skin was fossilized in calcium phosphate, a mineral that preserves details on a subcellular level. The fossil skin  from a 10 million year old colubrid snake from the Late Miocene Libros Lagerst\u00e4tte Teruel, Spain  preserves dermal pigment cells chromatophores in calcium phosphate, Dr. McNamara and her colleagues from Ireland and Spain said. The scientists discovered the mineralized skin cells when viewing the fossil under a scanning electron microscope and then matched the shapes up with pigment cells in modern snakes to determine what colors they might have produced. They determined that the fossilized snakeskin had three types of pigment cells in various combinations i melanophores, which contain the pigment melanin\nii xanthophores, which contain carotenoid and pterin pigments\niii iridophores, which create iridescence. According to the scientists, the snake was a mottled green and black, with a pale underside  colors that likely aided in daytime camouflage. Comparison with chromatophore abundance and position in extant reptiles indicates that the fossil snake was pale colored in ventral regions dorsal and lateral regions were green with brown black and yellow green transverse blotches, they said. Such coloration most likely functioned in substrate matching and intraspecific signaling. Up until this discovery, the only prospect for skin color being preserved in fossils was organic remains related to melanin, Dr. McNamara said. But now that we know color can be preserved even for tissues that are mineralized, its very exciting. The results were published online March 31, 2016 in the Current Biology.

Whitmire from the University of Arkansas, the suspected Planet Nine triggers comet showers linked to mass extinctions on Earth at intervals of about 27 million years. Though astronomers have been looking for Planet Nine for over a century, the possibility that its real got a big boost recently when Dr. Konstantin Batygin and Prof. Mike Brown from the California Institute of Technology Caltech inferred its existence based on orbital anomalies seen in objects in the Kuiper Belt. If the Caltech astronomers are correct, Planet Nine is a gas giant about 10 times more massive than Earth and could currently be up to 1,000 times more distant from the Sun. Prof. Whitmire and his colleague, Dr. John Matese, first published research on the connection between Planet Nine or as they called it Planet X and mass extinctions in the January 3, 1985 issue of the journal Nature. At the time there were three explanations proposed to explain the regular comet showers an unknown planet, the existence of a sister star to the Sun, and vertical oscillations of the Sun as it orbits the galaxy. The last two ideas have subsequently been ruled out as inconsistent with the paleontological record. Only Planet Nine remained as a viable hypothesis, and it is now gaining renewed attention. Prof. Whitemire and Dr. Mateses hypothesis is that as Planet Nine orbits the Sun, its tilted orbit slowly rotates and the planet passes through the Kuiper Belt of comets every 27 million years, knocking comets into the inner Solar System. The dislodged comets not only smash into the Earth, they also disintegrate in the inner Solar System as they get nearer to the Sun, reducing the amount of sunlight that reaches the Earth. In 1985, a look at the paleontological record supported the idea of regular comet showers dating back 250 million years. Newer research shows evidence of such events dating as far back as 500 million years. Prof. Whitmire and Dr. Matese published their own estimate on the size and orbit of Planet Nine in their original study. They believed it would be between one and five times the mass of Earth, and about 100 times more distant from the Sun, much smaller numbers than estimates of Dr. Batygin and Prof. Brown. Whats really exciting is the possibility that a distant planet may have had a significant influence on the evolution of life on Earth, said Prof. Whitmire, who published his findings in the January issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

"}, {"title": " Paleontologists Explain Evolution of Sauropod Dinosaurs", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 30, 2016", "doc": "A large team of paleontologists led by University of Liverpool scientist Dr. Karl Bates has developed computer models of the bodies of sauropod dinosaurs to examine the evolution of their body shape. Sauropod dinosaurs were the dominant group of large herbivores in global terrestrial ecosystems throughout much of the Mesozoic era. Some of the more well known sauropods include Diplodocus, Brontosaurus and Giraffatitan. Their colossal size and body plan are unparalleled in terrestrial vertebrates. They are renowned for their very long necks, long tails as well as four thick, pillar like legs and small heads in relation to their body. However, to date, there have been only limited attempts to examine how this unique body plan evolved and how it might be related to their gigantic body size. Dr. Bates and co authors used three dimensional computer models reconstructing the bodies of sauropod dinosaurs to analyze how their size, shape and weight distribution evolved over time. We combine three dimensional computational models with phylogenetic reconstructions to quantify the evolution of whole body shape and body segment properties across the sauropod radiation, the scientists said. They found evidence that changes in body shape coincided with major events in sauropod evolutionary history such as the rise of the titanosaurs. The early dinosaurs that sauropods evolved from were small and walked on two legs, with long tails, small chests and small forelimbs. The paleontologists estimate that this body shape concentrated their weight close to the hip joint, which would have helped them balance while walking bipedally on their hind legs. As sauropods evolved they gradually altered both their size and shape from this ancestral template, becoming not only significantly larger and heavier, but also gaining a proportionally larger chest, forelimbs and in particular a dramatically larger neck. The findings, published online in the journal Royal Society Open Science, show that these changes altered sauropods weight distribution as they grew in size, gradually shifting from being tail heavy, two legged animals to being front heavy, four legged animals, such as the large, fully quadrupedal Jurassic sauropods Diplodocus and Apatosaurus.  Dr. Bates and his colleagues found that these linked trends in size, body shape and weight distribution did not end with the evolution of fully quadrupedal sauropods. In the Cretaceous period  the last of the three ages of the dinosaurs  many earlier sauropod groups dwindled. In their place, a new and extremely large type of sauropod known as titanosaurs evolved, including the truly massive Argentinosaurus and Dreadnoughtus, among the largest known animals ever to have lived.

Dr. Phil Bell from the University of New England and Dr. Philip Currie from the University of Alberta, announced the discovery of Boreonykus certekorum this week in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. According to the team, this new dinosaur lived about 72 million years ago Late Cretaceous epoch. It had killer claws and was a relative of Velociraptor, a small carnivorous dinosaur made famous by the Jurassic Park movies. The fossilized remains of the ancient animal were unearthed from the Wapiti Formation, near the city of Grande Prairie, central western Alberta. The bones we have show it would have had big hand and foot claws, a real killing claw, the paleontologists said. The claws would have been used to hunt down prey. We have a handful of teeth that are like serrated steak knives. These would have been pretty savage predators. The scientists estimate the creature was about 13 feet 2 m long and as tall as a dog. It skin was probably feathered to keep the dinosaur warm in the cold dark winters in north Canada, Dr. Bell and Dr. Currie said. The discovery of Boreonykus certekorum is significant as it fills an important gap in how the raptors moved and adapted to the environment. Its closest ancestors were from Mongolia, so this species probably crossed the land bridge from northern Asia to North America, the scientists said.

According to the team, T. gregarium is part of the same lineage as the modern lamprey. Tullimonstrum gregarium  named after Francis Tully, the fossil hunter who came across it in coal mining pits in northeastern Illinois  lived during the Carboniferous period, about 307 million years ago. It was discovered in 1958 and first described scientifically in 1966. According to scientists, Tully monsters look like something out of science fiction  aquatic animals with tube shaped bodies up to one foot 30 cm long, skinny snouts ending in a toothed jaw or claw, and eyes at the end of short stalks. For many years, paleontologists couldnt determine what kinds of animals these prehistoric monsters actually were  they were categorized as soft bodied invertebrates, with theories ranging from worms to shell less snails. But in a paper published this week in the journal Nature, Dr. Victoria McCoy from the University of Leicester and her colleagues from Yale University, the American Museum of Natural History, Argonne National Laboratory, and Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, announced that Tullimonstrum gregarium is in fact a vertebrate. We had a very clear picture of what it looked like, but no clear picture of what it was, Dr. McCoy said. Using a collection of 2,000 specimens of Tullimonstrum gregarium, the paleontologists analyzed the morphology and preservation of various features of the animal. Powerful, new analytical techniques also were brought to bear, such as synchrotron elemental mapping, which illuminates an animals physical features by mapping the chemistry within a fossil. The scientists concluded that the Tully monster had gills and a notochord, which functioned as a rudimentary spinal cord. Neither feature had been identified in the animal previously. The animals are related to the jawless fishes that are still around today by a unique combination of traits, including primitive gills, rows of teeth, and traces of a notochord, the flexible rod like structure along the back thats present in chordate animals  including vertebrates like us, said co author Dr. Paul Mayer, from the Field Museum of Natural History. Tullimonstrum gregarium is so different from its modern relatives that we dont know much about how it lived. It has big eyes and lots of teeth, so it was probably a predator, Dr. McCoy said. Some key questions about Tully monsters remain unanswered, however. No one knows when the animal first appeared on Earth or when it went extinct, the scientists said. Its existence in the fossil record is confined to the Illinois mining site.

Timurlengia euotica lived during the Cretaceous period, approximately 90 million years ago, according to an international team of paleontologists led by Dr. Steve Brusatte from the University of Edinburgh, UK. This species fills a 20 million year gap in the fossil record of tyrannosaurs  the iconic group of dinosaurian carnivores that includes T. rex and Albertosaurus, and provides key insights into how the group evolved. Timurlengia euoticas skull was much smaller than that of T. rex, indicating that it did not grow to the same enormous size, Dr. Brusatte and his colleagues said. However, key features of its skull reveal that its brain and senses were already highly developed. The new species was about the size of a horse, and could weigh up to 250 kg. It had long legs and a skull studded with sharp teeth, and was likely a fast runner. Timurlengia euotica was a nimble pursuit hunter with slender, blade like teeth suitable for slicing through meat, said team member Dr. Hans Sues, from the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. It probably preyed on the various large plant eaters, especially early duck billed dinosaurs, which shared its world. Clues from the life of Timurlengia euotica allow us to fill in gaps and better understand the life and evolution of other related dinosaurs, like T. rex. According to the team, the first tyrannosaurs lived during the Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago, and were only slightly larger than a human. However, by the Late Cretaceous period  around 100 million years later  tyrannosaurs had evolved into animals like T. rex. The small size of Timurlengia euotica some 80 million years after tyrannosaurs first appeared in the fossil record indicates that the huge size developed only toward the end of the groups long evolutionary history. The ancestors of T. rex would have looked a whole lot like Timurlengia euotica, a horse sized hunter with a big brain and keen hearing that would put us to shame, Dr. Brusatte said. Only after these ancestral tyrannosaurs evolved their clever brains and sharp senses did they grow into the colossal sizes of T. rex. Tyrannosaurs had to get smart before they got big, he added. Central Asia was the place where many of the familiar groups of Cretaceous dinosaurs had their roots. The discoveries from the Kyzylkum Desert of Uzbekistan are now helping us to trace the early history of these animals, many of which later flourished in our own backyard in North America, Dr. Sues said. Timurlengia euotica is described in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The reptile, named Teyujagua paradoxa, lived just after the great Permo Triassic mass extinction event that occurred 252 million years ago. This extinction wiped out about 90 of all species then living and was probably triggered by giant and intense volcanic eruptions in what is now Siberia. The exceptional fossil skull of Teyujagua paradoxa was found in a Triassic rock exposure near the city of S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis. According to Dr. Felipe Pinheiro from the Universidade Federal do Pampa, this fossil is very different from other fossils from the same age. Its anatomy is intermediate between the primitive reptiles and an important group called Archosauriformes archosauriforms. Dinosaurs, crocodilians, birds, pterosaurs and their close relatives all belong to the clade Archosauriformes, an extraordinarily diverse group that dominated terrestrial tetrapod faunas worldwide for nearly the entire Mesozoic Era, around 175 million years, and plays a major role in the modern biota, with birds comprising around a third of extant tetrapod biodiversity, Dr. Pinheiro and co authors explained in a paper in the journal Scientific Reports. However, the origins of this clade and its extraordinarily successful body plan remain obscure. We describe an exceptionally preserved fossil skull from the Lower Triassic of Brazil, representing a new species, Teyujagua paradoxa, transitional in morphology between archosauriforms and more primitive reptiles. Teyujagua paradoxa was a small, quadrupedal reptile. The species grew up to about 5 feet 1.5 m in length and lived in the margins of lakes and rivers, hunting amphibians and procolophonids  extinct, small bodied reptiles similar to lizards. Its teeth were recurved with fine serrations and sharply pointed, indicating a carnivorous diet. The nostrils were placed on the upper part of the snout, a typical feature of some aquatic or semi aquatic animals, such as modern day crocodiles. Teyujagua paradoxa is a really important discovery because it helps us understand the origins of archosauriforms, said co author Dr. Richard Butler from the University of Birmingham, UK. Archosauriforms are spectacularly diverse and include everything from hummingbirds and crocodiles to giant dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex and Brachiosaurus. Teyujagua paradoxa fills an evolutionary gap between archosauriforms and more primitive reptiles and helps us understand how the archosauriform skull first evolved, he said.

Ichthyosaurs were predatory marine reptiles that ranged in size from 1 to 69 feet 0.3  21 m long. They swam the worlds oceans while dinosaurs walked the land. Despite their profound adaptations to the aquatic realm and their apparent success throughout Triassic and Jurassic periods, these marine reptiles disappeared roughly 30 million years before the end Cretaceous mass extinction 65 million years ago that marked the end for dinosaurs and the beginning of the age of mammals. Current hypotheses for this early demise involve relatively minor biotic events increased competition with other marine reptiles, or a diversity drop in their assumed principal food resource, but are at odds with recent understanding of the ichthyosaur fossil record. Recent data challenge this view of ichthyosaur history, indicating that Early Cretaceous ichthyosaurs were taxonomically, phylogenetically and  possibly  ecologically diverse, even a few million years before their extinction, said study lead author Dr. Valentin Fischer, of the University of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, and the University of Oxford, and his colleagues. The researchers analyzed the extinction of this marine group thoroughly for the first time. Using a battery of cutting edge techniques to quantify ancient biodiversity and its fluctuations, they were able to reconstruct the evolution of the ichthyosaurs during the last 120 million years of their lifetime and assess the causes of their extinction. We compared the diversity of ichthyosaurs with the geological record of global change, emphasizing the dynamics of these datasets, Dr. Fischer said. According to the team, a two phase event suppressed their ecological diversity and wiped out the group at the beginning of the Late Cretaceous, about 100 million years ago. At that time, the Earths poles were essentially ice free, and sea levels were much higher than today. Analyses revealed that this two phase extinction can be associated both with reduced evolutionary rates a failure to evolve novel body plans for a prolonged period and intense climate change strong variations in sea surface temperatures and sea levels. Although the rising temperatures and sea levels evidenced in rock records throughout the world may not directly have affected ichthyosaurs, related factors such as changes in food availability, migratory routes, competitors and birthing places are all potential drivers, probably occurring in conjunction to drive ichthyosaurs to extinction, Dr. Fischer said. This study supports a growing body of evidence suggesting that a major, global, change driven turnover profoundly reorganized marine ecosystems at the beginning of the Late Cretaceous, giving rise to the highly peculiar and geologically brief Late Cretaceous marine world. Ichthyosaurs disappeared in the course of this turnover, while numerous lineages of bony fishes and sharks evolved, the scientists said.

This early fungus, known as Tortotubus protuberans, displays a structure similar to one found in some modern fungi, which likely enabled it to store and transport nutrients through the process of decomposition. During the period when this organism existed, life was almost entirely restricted to the oceans nothing more complex than simple mossy and lichen like plants had yet evolved on the land. But before there could be flowering plants or trees, or the animals that depend on them, the processes of rot and soil formation needed to be established, said Dr. Smith, who is an author of a paper published in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society. He found that Tortotubus protuberans had a cord like structure, similar to that of some modern fungi, in which the main filament sends out primary and secondary branches that stick back onto the main filament, eventually enveloping it. This cord like structure is often seen in land based organisms, allowing them to spread out and colonize surfaces. In modern fungi, the structure is associated with the decomposition of matter, allowing a fungus colony to move nutrients to where they are needed  a useful adaptation in an environment where nutrients are scarce and unevenly distributed. In contrast with early plants, which lacked roots and therefore had limited interaction with activity beneath the surface, fungi played an important role in stabilizing sediment, encouraging weathering and forming soils. What we see in this fossil is complex fungal behavior in some of the earliest terrestrial ecosystems  contributing to soil formation and kick starting the process of rotting on land, Dr. Smith said. A question, however, is what was there for Tortotubus protuberans to decompose. Its likely that there were bacteria or algae on land during this period, but these organisms are rarely found as fossils, he added.

Abelisaurs Abelisauridae were a group of meat eating dinosaurs, characterized by very small forelimbs, a short deep face, small razor sharp teeth, and powerful muscular hind limbs. Paleontologists suspect these ancient predators were also covered in fluffy feathers. The abelisaur in the current study lived around 95 million years ago Cretaceous period in what is now North Africa, which at that time was a lush savannah criss crossed by rivers and mangrove swamps. This ancient tropical world would have provided the abelisaur with an ideal habitat for hunting aquatic animals like turtles, crocodiles, large fish and other dinosaurs, said Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza from Imperial College London and Andrea Cau from the University of Bolognas Geological and Paleontological Museum. By studying the fossilized dinosaur bone from Morocco, the paleontologists deduced that this abelisaur may have been 29.5 feet 9 m long and weighed about 2,000 kg. Fossilized femora are useful for paleontologists to study because they can determine the overall size of a dinosaur, the scientists explained. This is because femora are attached to the thigh and tail muscles and have scars, or bumps, which tell scientists where the ligaments and muscles were attached to the bone and how big those muscles and ligaments would have been. Smaller abelisaur fossils have been previously found by paleontologists, but this find shows how truly huge these flesh eating predators had become, said Chiarenza, who is the lead author of a paper in the journal Peer J. Their appearance may have looked a bit odd as they were probably covered in feathers with tiny, useless forelimbs, but make no mistake they were fearsome killers in their time.

The fossil in question is of Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis, a crustacean like animal that lived approximately 520 million years ago Cambrian period in what is now China. This creature belongs to a group of animals called fuxianhuiids, and was an early ancestor of modern arthropods insects, spiders and crustaceans. The fossil has been so well preserved that individual nerves are visible, the first time this level of detail has been observed in a fossil of this age. This is a unique glimpse into what the ancestral nervous system looked like. Its the most complete example of a central nervous system from the Cambrian period, said team member Dr. Javier Ortega Hern\u00e1ndez, a paleobiologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, and a co author of a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Like modern arthropods, Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis had a nerve cord  which is analogous to a spinal cord in vertebrates  running throughout its body, with each one of the bead like ganglia controlling a single pair of walking legs. Closer examination of the ganglia revealed dozens of spindly fibers, each measuring about 15,000 mm in length. These delicate fibers displayed a highly regular distribution pattern, and so we wanted to figure out if they were made of the same material as the ganglia that form the nerve cord, Dr. Ortega Hern\u00e1ndez said. Using fluorescence microscopy, we confirmed that the fibers were in fact individual nerves, fossilized as carbon films, offering an unprecedented level of detail, These fossils greatly improve our understanding of how the nervous system evolved. Further analysis revealed that some aspects of the nervous system in Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis appear to be structured similar to that of modern priapulids penis worms and onychophorans velvet worms, with regularly spaced nerves coming out from the ventral nerve cord. In contrast, these dozens of nerves have been lost independently in the tardigrades water bears and modern arthropods, suggesting that simplification played an important role in the evolution of the nervous system. Possibly one of the most striking implications of the study is that the exceptionally preserved nerve cord of Chengjiangocaris kunmingensis represents a unique structure that is otherwise unknown in living organisms. The specimen demonstrates the unique contribution of the fossil record towards understanding the early evolution of animals during the Cambrian period, Dr. Zhang and co authors said. The more of these fossils we find, the more we will be able to understand how the nervous system  and how early animals  evolved, Dr. Ortega Hern\u00e1ndez said.

The study, led by Dr. David Gold of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT, confirms that sea sponges are the source of an unusual molecule found in rocks that are 640 million years old  far before the Cambrian explosion. We brought together paleontological and genetic evidence to make a pretty strong case that this really is a molecular fossil of sponges. This is some of the oldest evidence for animal life, Dr. Gold said. Scientists have unearthed an extraordinary number of fossils from the time of the Cambrian explosion circa 521514 million years ago. Based on the fossil record, some of them have argued that contemporary animal groups exploded onto Earth, very quickly morphing from single celled organisms to complex multicellular animals in a relatively short geological time span. However, the fossils that are known from before the Cambrian explosion are peculiar in many respects, making it extremely difficult to determine which type of animal was the first to the evolutionary line. Dr. Gold, Prof. Roger Summons, also from MIT, and their colleagues have been looking for the answer in molecular fossils. Theres a feeling that animals should be much older than the Cambrian, because a lot of animals are showing up at the same time, but fossil evidence for animals before that has been contentious. So people are interested in the idea that some of these biomarkers and chemicals, molecules left behind, might help resolve these debates, Dr. Gold said. The team has focused on 24 isopropylcholestane 24 ipc for short, a lipid molecule, or sterol, that is a modified version of cholesterol. In 1994, scientists first found this molecule in Cambrian and slightly older rocks, and they speculated that sponges or their ancestors might be the source. In 2009, they confirmed the presence of 24 ipc in 640 million year old rock samples from Oman, potentially representing the oldest evidence for animal life. Its known that some modern sea sponges and certain types of algae produce 24 ipc today, the scientists said. But which organism was around to make the molecule 640 million years ago? To answer this question, Dr. Gold and co authors sought to first identify the gene responsible for making 24 ipc, then find the organisms that carry this gene, and finally trace when the gene evolved in those organisms. They looked through the genomes of about 30 different organisms, including plants, fungi, algae, and sea sponges, to see what kinds of sterols each organism produces and to identify the genes associated with those sterols. What we found was this really interesting pattern across most of eukaryotic life, Dr. Gold said. By comparing genomes, they identified a single gene  sterol methyltransferase SMT  responsible for producing certain kinds of sterols depending on the number of copies of the gene an organism carries. They found that sea sponge and algae species that produce 24 ipc have an extra copy of SMT when compared with their close relatives. The scientists compared the copies to determine how they were all related and when each copy of the gene first appeared. They then mapped the relationships onto an evolutionary tree and used evidence from the fossil record to determine when each SMT gene duplication occurred. No matter how they manipulated the timing of the evolutionary tree, they found that sea sponges evolved the extra copy of SMT much earlier than algae, and they did so around 640 million years ago  the same time period in which 24 ipc was found in rocks.

Glyptodont looked like a gigantic and fearsome armadillo. Roughly the size and weight of a Volkswagen Beetle, the ancient animal was distinguished by its massive, heavy shell of armor, and a club shaped, armored tail. Although scientists like Charles Darwin collected partial remains of glyptodonts in the early 19th century, at first nobody knew what kind of mammal they represented. It was eventually accepted that they must be related in some way to armadillos, the only other New World mammals to develop a protective bony shell. However, because of the many physical differences between these two groups, most scientists have held the view that they must have separated very early in their evolutionary history. Glyptodonts in fact represent an extinct lineage that likely originated about 35 million years ago within the armadillo radiation, explained team member Dr. Hendrik Poinar, a researcher with McMaster University, Canada, and senior author of a paper in the journal Current Biology. Glyptodonts should probably be considered a subfamily of gigantic armadillos, added co author Dr. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Delsuc, of CNRS. We speculate that the peculiar structure of their unarticulated carapace might have evolved as a response to the functional constraint imposed by the size increase they experienced over time. Using an innovative approach to recover genetic information from ancient specimens, the scientists successfully assembled the complete mitochondrial genome of Doedicurus  a gigantic glyptodont that lived until about 10,000 years ago  and compared it to that of all modern xenarthrans anteaters, tree sloths and armadillos. Ancient DNA has the potential to solve a number of evolutionary questions, but it is often extremely difficult to obtain endogenous DNA, that is, DNA actually belonging to the animal being sampled, rather than some contaminant, Dr Poinar said. In this particular case, we used a technical trick that allowed us to selectively enrich our Doedicurus DNA extract so that we had enough endogenous genetic material to work with, the researchers explained. Their phylogenetic analysis establishes that glyptodonts are in fact deeply nested within the armadillo crown group, representing a distinct subfamily Glyptodontinae within the family known as the Chlamyphoridae, represented today by the four ounce pink fairy armadillo, or pichiciego Chlamyphorus truncatus, and the giant armadillo Priodontes maximus, which can weigh up to 80 kg, for instance. Molecular dating suggests that glyptodonts diverged no earlier than about 35 million years ago. Their findings also highlight the impressive increase in glyptodonts size over evolutionary time. The scientists estimate that the last common ancestor of glyptodonts and their living armadillo relatives weighed in at a mere 6 kg, suggesting a spectacular increase in glyptodont body mass. Thats consistent with the fossil record, which shows glyptodonts evolved from medium sized forms about 80 kg to become true megafauna in the Pleistocene reaching 2,000 kg before their disappearance at the end of the last Ice Age. The team intends to continue to explore ancient DNA lifted from numerous other fossil xenarthrans, including giant ground sloths.

The evidence is a fossil toe bone from Ellesmere Island above the Arctic Circle. The Gastornis fossil from Ellesmere Island has been discussed by paleontologists since it was collected in the 1970s and appears on a few lists of the prehistoric fauna there, said lead author Prof. Thomas Stidham, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology. But this is the first time the bone has been closely examined and described. Gastornis  a large middle Eocene 55 36 million years ago bird  probably was a vegan, using its huge beak to tear at foliage, nuts, seeds and hard fruit. The fossil specimens of Gastornis also have been found in Europe and Asia, Prof. Stidham said. We knew there were a few bird fossils from Ellesmere Island, but we also knew they were extremely rare, added co author Dr. Jaelyn Eberle, of the University of Colorado at Boulder. In addition to the Gastornis bone from Ellesmere, another scientist reported seeing a fossil footprint there, probably from a large flightless bird, although its specific location remains unknown. She added about 53 million years ago during the early Eocene Epoch, the environment of Ellesmere Island was probably similar to cypress swamps in the southeast U.S. today. Fossil evidence indicates the island, which is adjacent to Greenland, hosted turtles, alligators, primates, tapirs and even large hippo like and rhino like mammals. According to the paleontologists, Gastornis, along with some of the mammalian and reptilian members of the Eocene Arctic fauna, likely over wintered in the Arctic. Multiple paleoclimate proxies estimate a mild temperate climate for the Eocene High Arctic, where winters remained at or just above freezing and summer temperatures extended to 20\u2009degrees Celsius or higher, Prof. Stidham and Dr. Eberle wrote in the Scientific Reports paper. These temperatures are a far cry from todays High Arctic, where central Ellesmere Island experiences a mean annual temperature of minus 19\u2009degrees Celsius, a warm month mean temperature of about 6\u2009degrees Celsius and a cold month mean temperature of minus 38 degrees Celsius or colder. Despite the milder Eocene climate on Ellesmere Island, prolonged periods of darkness occurred during the winter. In the same paper, the scientists described another Ellesmere Island bird from the early Eocene. Named Presbyornis, it was similar to birds in todays duck, goose and swan family but with long, flamingo like legs. The evidence was a single humerus, or upper wing bone, collected by the same team that found the Gastornis bone. It is not known whether Presbyornis migrated north to Ellesmere Island every year or lived there year round, Prof. Stidham said. Given the fossils we have, both hypotheses are possible. There are some sea ducks today that spend the winter in the cold, freezing Arctic, and we see many more species of waterfowl that are only in the Arctic during the relatively warmer spring and summer months.

Asterids are among Earths most important and diverse plants, with 10 orders, 98 families, and about 80,000 species. They represent about one third of all the planets diversity of flowering plants. The new fossils are about 20 to 30 million years old and are only known as flowers, more precisely corollas with stamens and styles. They represent a new species of the genus Strychnos, which ultimately gave rise to some of the worlds most famous poisons, including strychnine and curare. The specimens are beautiful, perfectly preserved fossil flowers, which at one point in time were borne by plants that lived in a steamy tropical forest with both large and small trees, climbing vines, palms, grasses and other vegetation, said team member Prof. George Poinar, Jr., from Oregon State University. Specimens such as these are what give us insights into the ecology of ecosystems in the distant past, he added. They show that the asterids, which later gave humans all types of foods and other products, were already evolving many millions of years ago. Prof. Poinar and his colleague, Dr. Lena Struwe of Rutgers University, named the new species Strychnos electri in honor of its amber origin, since elektron is the Greek word for amber. The species has likely been extinct for a long time, but many new species living and, unfortunately, soon to be extinct species are discovered by scientists every year, Prof. Poinar noted. The discovery of these two fossil flowers suggests that many other related plant families could have evolved in the Late Cretaceous in tropical forests, the paleontologists said. Their fossil remains, however, still await discovery. Strychnos electri is described in a paper in the journal Nature Plants.

The two new species  Rhinconichthys purgatoirensis and R. uyenoi  lived approximately 92 million years ago in the seas of Cretaceous North America and Japan. Rhinconichthys purgatorensis from the lowermost Carlile Shale middle Turonian, southeastern Colorado, United States and R. uyenoi from the Upper Cretaceous Cenomanian Mikasa Formation, Middle Yezo Group, Hokkaido, Japan, the paleontologists said. Rhinconichthys are exceptionally rare, known previously by only one species from England, added team member Dr. Kenshu Shimada, of DePaul University. But a new skull from North America, discovered in Colorado, along with the re examination of another skull from Japan have tripled the number of species in the genus with a greatly expanded geographical range. I was in a team that named Rhinconichthys in 2010, Dr. Shimada said, which was based on a single species from England, but we had no idea back then that the genus was so diverse and so globally distributed. Rhinconichthys belongs to an extinct bony fish group called pachycormids, which contains the largest bony fish ever to have lived. According to the team, the total length of R. uyenoi is estimated to be between 11 and 15 feet 3.4  4.5 m. R. purgatoirensis is moderate in size with adults ranging between 6.5 and 9 feet 2  2.7 m in total length. The most peculiar aspect of Rhinconichthys is the pair of prominent, highly elongate bones called hyomandibulae. We consider this feature to be an important functional specialization that is key to the biology of Rhinconichthys, the scientists said. According to Dr. Shimada and co authors, Rhinconichthys fed on plankton. One pair of hyomandibulae formed a massive oar shaped lever to protrude and swing the jaws open extra wide, like a parachute, in order to receive more plankton rich water into its mouth, Dr. Shimada explained. This specialized cranial construction was previously unknown among Cretaceous bony fish, and functionally parallels that of the modern paddlefish Polyodon and many sharks, the researchers said. Based on our new study, we now have three different species of Rhinconichthys from three separate regions of the globe, each represented by a single skull, Dr. Shimada noted. This tells just how little we still know about the biodiversity of organisms through the Earths history. Its really mind boggling. Research describing Rhinconichthys purgatoirensis and R. uyenoi is published online in the journal Cretaceous Research.

The findings were published online February 4 in the journal Current Biology. The findings showed a convergent evolution across millions of years between two very distantly related species, said co lead author Dr J. Tyler Faith, of the University of Queensland. Dr. Faith and his colleagues were working on a field program in the Lake Victoria region when other scientists directed them to a site they called Bovid Hill. The hill had been so named because of an abundance of fossil Bovidae antelopes and buffaloes eroding from its surface. After several years of collecting fossils from Bovid Hill, it became very clear that most of the fossils belonged to the poorly known species Rusingoryx atopocranion, described from the same site in 1983, and that we may be dealing with an entire herd that was somehow wiped out and buried at the site, Dr. Faith said. I was astonished to see that the skulls looked unlike any antelope that I had ever seen  the only thing more surprising would have been fossil zebras with horns growing from their heads. The anatomy was clearly remarkable. During further testing the similarity to hadrosaurs was immediately clear to the team. According to the scientists, this evolutionary convergence may be explained by similarities in the way Rusingoryx atopocranion and hadrosaurs lived. It appears that both\u00a0Rusingoryx atopocranion and hadrosaurs evolved their nasal domes in a similar way and that it also developed in the same way as the animals aged from juveniles to adults, they said. Paleontologists have reconstructed that hadrosaurs were herbivores and likely lived in large herds in relatively open environments, and we think this was the case for Rusingoryx atopocranion, said co author Dr. Daniel Peppe of Baylor University. It seems likely that they both experienced the same evolutionary pressures to evolve a nasal crest that allowed vocalization. There are probably very few ways for animals to evolve these features and that if or when they do, it will happen in a similar way. Dr Haley OBrien, a co lead author on the study and a researcher at Ohio University, added both Rusingoryx atopocranion and hadrosaur dinosaurs were thought to have been highly social. They might have communicated with each other across fairly large distances. Vocalizations can alert predators, and moving their calls into a new frequency could have made communication safer. On top of this, we know Rusingoryx atopocranion and hadrosaurs were herbivores, each having their own highly specialized teeth. Their respective, remarkable dental specializations may have initiated changes in the lower jaw and cheek bones that ultimately led to the type of modification we see in the derived, crest bearing forms.

Measuring about 25 feet 7.6 m long, Eotrachodon orientalis lived about 83 million years ago, in the Upper Cretaceous period. According to a paper published online last week in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, it is one of the oldest hadrosaurids popularly known as duck billed dinosaurs known and the only hadrosaurid from Appalachia present day eastern North America with a preserved skull. This is a really important animal in telling us how they came to be and how they spread all over the world, said team member Prof. Gregory Erickson, of Florida State University. The fossilized skeleton of Eotrachodon orientalis, including a skull, several backbones, a partial hip bone and a few bones from the limbs, was originally found by fossil enthusiasts alongside a creek near Montgomery, Montgomery County, Alabama, southeastern United States. The dinosaur mostly walked on its hind legs though it could come down on all four to graze on plants with its grinding teeth, and had a scaly exterior. But what set it apart is that it had a large crest on its nose. This thing had a big ugly nose, Prof. Erickson said. During the Upper Cretaceous, North America was divided in half by a 1,000 mile ocean that connected the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean, the scientists said. This body of water created two North American landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The area of what was considered Appalachia is a bit wider than what we call Appalachia today. It began roughly in Georgia and Alabama and stretched all the way north into Canada. For roughly 100 million years, the dinosaurs were not able to cross this barrier, said Dr. Jun Ebersole of McWane Science Center. The discovery of Eotrachodon orientalis suggests that duck billed dinosaurs originated in Appalachia and dispersed to other parts of the world at some point after the seaway lowered, opening a land corridor to western North America. They just needed to get off the island, Prof. Erickson added. From there, they became the cows of the Cretaceous.

A partial skeleton of the new dinosaur, including a skull and teeth, was discovered on a beach near Cardiff. It was analyzed by a team of UK scientists led by Dr. David Martill from the University of Portsmouth, and was identified as a new species and genus of the theropod dinosaur. Approximately 40 of a skeleton including cranial and postcranial remains representing a new genus and species of basal neotheropod dinosaur is described, Dr. Martill and his colleagues from the Amgueddfa Cymru  National Museum Wales, the University of Manchester, and the University of Portsmouth, wrote in a paper in the journal PLoS ONE. It was collected from fallen blocks from a sea cliff that exposes Late Triassic and Early Jurassic marine and quasi marine strata on the south Wales coast near the city of Cardiff. Dr. Martill and co authors proposed the name Dracoraptor hanigani for this new dinosaur. The genus name Dracoraptor is from Draco alluding to the dragon of Wales with raptor, meaning robber, a commonly employed suffix for theropod dinosaurs, they explained. The species name honors Nick and Rob Hanigan who discovered the skeleton. According to the paleontologists, Dracoraptor hanigani was a small, agile carnivore, about 2.3 feet 70 cm tall and 6.5 feet 2 m long, with a long tail. It was a distant cousin of T. rex and lived at the beginning of the Jurassic period, approximately 200 million years ago, possibly making it the oldest Jurassic dinosaur in the UK or even in the world. The specimen also represents the most complete theropod dinosaur from Wales and the first dinosaur skeleton from the Jurassic of Wales. It is thought that the fossil was from a juvenile animal as most of its bones are not yet fully formed. The Triassic Jurassic extinction event is often credited for the later success of dinosaurs through the Jurassic and Cretaceous, but previously we knew very little about dinosaurs at the start of this diversification and rise to dominance, said co author Dr. Steven Vidovic, of the University of Portsmouth. Now we have Dracoraptor, a relatively complete 6 foot long juvenile theropod from the very earliest days of the Jurassic in Wales.

Dr Tikhonov and co authors reported their find in the Jan. 15 issue of the journal Science. Archaeological evidence for human dispersal through northern Eurasia before 40,000 years ago is rare. In west Siberia, the northernmost find of that age is located at 57\u00b0N, they said. Elsewhere, the earliest presence of humans in the Arctic is commonly thought to be circa 35,000 to 30,000 years before the present. A mammoth kill site in the central Siberian Arctic expands the populated area to almost 72\u00b0N. In 2012, a group led by Dr Tikhonov excavated a partial carcass of a woolly mammoth from frozen sediments exposed in a coastal bluff on the eastern shore of Yenisei Bay, in the central Siberian Arctic. The mammoth is an exceptionally complete mammoth skeleton with a small amount of preserved soft tissue, including the remains of the fat hump and the penis. It is more complete than other recent finds from Taimyr, known as the Kastyktakh and Jarkov mammoths, the scientists said. Through radiocarbon dating of the mammoths tibia bone and surrounding materials, the paleontologists dated it at 45,000 years old. The large amount of fat at the hump indicates that the mammoth was in a good physical condition. This was a young male around 15 years old, according to the tooth change model. Its bones exhibit a number of unusual injuries. Dr Tikhonov and his colleagues analyzed these injuries. They include dents likely from sharp weapon tips such as thrusting spears and damage to the tusk suggestive of human attempts to separate the outside of the tusk by chopping. These findings leave no doubt that people were present in the central Siberian Arctic by about 45,000 years ago, the researchers said. Advancements in mammoth hunting probably allowed people to survive and spread widely across northernmost Arctic Siberia at this time, representing an important cultural shift  one that likely facilitated the arrival of humans in the area close to the Bering land bridge, providing them an opportunity to enter the New World before the Last Glacial Maximum.

At roughly 20 feet 6 m in length and 8 feet 2.5 m high, the new species  scientifically named Morelladon beltrani  was a relatively large dinosaur. The dinosaurs incomplete skeleton was collected in the Mas de Sabat\u00e9 site within the Mas de la Parreta Quarry at Morella, Spain. It was analyzed by a team of Spanish paleontologists from the National Distance Education University NDEU in Madrid and the Autonomous University of Madrid AUM. The paleontologists said Morelladon beltrani is so unique that it represents a new genus. The beast, according to the team, was a relative of Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis and the famous duckbilled, plant eating Iguanodon. An analysis of the evolutionary relationships of Morelladon shows that it is most closely related to Iguanodon and Mantelliaurus species also from the same location in Spain, said Dr Jos\u00e9 Miguel Gasulla of the AUMs Department of Paleontology and his colleagues. This suggests that in the Early Cretaceous of Europe, which would have been an island archipelago at the time, we had endemic pockets of dinosaurs living and evolving alongside one another. The Morelladon beltranis most distinctive feature is the presence of tall neural spines on dorsal vertebrae, which was possibly a sail used for thermoregulation, or as a storage place for fat to be used during periods of low food supply. We knew the dinosaur fauna from Morella was similar to those of other contemporary European sites, said Dr Fernando Escaso of the NDEUs Group of Evolutionary Biology. However, this discovery shows an interesting rise of the iguanodontoid diversity in southern Europe 125 million years ago. The discovery of Morelladon beltrani, combined with other recently named taxa Delapparentia turolensis, Proa valdearinnoensis, Iguanodon galvensis, recognizes the Iberian Peninsula as a highly diverse Early Cretaceous medium large bodied styracosternan assemblage worldwide, the scientists said. The discovery is reported December 16 in the online edition of the journal PLoS ONE.

These ancient worms are closely related to the ancestor of animal phylum Kinorhyncha mud dragons, which includes about 240 extant species of exclusively marine, free living worms. Kinorhynchs represent an animal group that is related to arthropods  insects, shrimps, spiders, etc.  which are the most diverse group of animals on the planet, said team member Prof. Shuhai Xiao of Virginia Tech. The body of kinorhynchs is divided into a head, a neck, and a trunk with 11 segments. According to the paleontologists, these microscopic worms offer an excellent model to investigate the origins of body segmentation. These creatures could provide clues to origins of body segmentation, but such efforts have been hampered by a lack of well preserved kinorhynch fossils, until now, said Prof. Xiao, who is a co author of a paper in the journal Scientific Reports. These fossils  Eokinorhynchus rarus means rare ancient mud dragon and two unnamed forms  were collected from the Dengying Formation in northern Sichuan Province and the Kuanchuanpu Formation in southern Shaanxi Province, South China. Although arthropod fossils date back to more than 530 million years ago, no kinorhynch fossils have ever been reported, Prof. Xiao said. This is a huge gap in the fossil record, with more than 540 million years of evolutionary history undocumented. Our discovery is the first report of kinorhynch fossils. Prof. Xiao and his colleagues from China and the United States believe kinorhynchs and arthropods should have evolved more than 540 million years ago. More so, they found that Eokinorhynchus rarus has a number of similarities with living kinorhynchs, suggesting a close evolutionary relationship. Similarities between the fossils of Eokinorhynchus rarus and living, modern kinorhynchs include their hollow spines arranged in a five fold symmetry and their body segments each consisting of articulated plates. However, Eokinorhynchus rarus differs from modern species with more numerous segments. Hence the belief of an ancestorship. Future discovery of additional kinorhynch fossil will offer important insights into the early evolutionary history of this group of tiny and little known animals, Prof. Xiao said.

This new species is one of a group of four legged armored herbivorous dinosaurs called ankylosaurs. The near complete skeleton of the 100 million year old Cretaceous period beast, including most of the skull and mandible, along with postcranial material, was discovered in 1989 in the Allaru Mudstone on Marathon Station near Richmond, north western Queensland, by Mr Ian Ievers. But new research led by University of Queensland paleontologist Lucy Leahey has revealed the specimen is a distinctly different species than previously thought. When it was first studied back in the 1990s, the fossil was placed it in the same genus as Australias only other named ankylosaur, Minmi, which is based on some bones from Roma in south western Queensland, Ms Leahey explained. The find is one of the best preserved ankylosaur fossils in the world and the most complete dinosaur so far discovered in Australia. Ms Leahey and her colleagues named the new ankylosaur Kunbarrasaurus ieversi, a reference to the man who first found it. The species name honors Mr Ian Ievers, discoverer of the holotype. The name therefore means Ievers shield lizard, they explained. The generic name combines Kunbarra kunbara, the Mayi Wunumara word for shield, and souros, the Greek word for lizard, and is a reference to the animals heavily ossified skin. According to the team, Kunbarrasaurus ieversi had a parrot like beak, bones in its skin and an inner ear similar to a turtle. Our work has also revealed that Kunbarrasaurus is more primitive than the majority of other well known ankylosaurs from North America and Asia, said team member Dr Steve Salisbury, also of the University of Queensland. It appears to represent an early, less heavily armored member of the group, close to the point at which the ankylosaurs diverged from the other main lineage of armored dinosaurs, the stegosaurs. Research describing Kunbarrasaurus ieversi is published online in the journal PeerJ.

This new dinosaur was a distant cousin of the famed ceratopsian dinosaur Triceratops and lived early in the Late Jurassic period, roughly 160 million years ago. According to a study published this week in the journal PLoS ONE, the find is one of the oldest known of ceratopsians. The remains of Hualianceratops wucaiwanensis  a partial skull and foot  were collected from the Shishugou Formation of the Junggar Basin, northwestern China. Like Triceratops, the new species was a plant eater. But it didnt have horns and was about the size of a spaniel. Hualianceratops wucaiwanensis walked on two legs and had ornamental texture on nearly all parts of the skull. The team, led by Prof. Xu Xing from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in China and Dr James Clark from the George Washington University, discovered this dinosaur in the same part of the Shishugou Formation as Yinlong downsi, the oldest known ceratopsian dinosaur. Finding these two species in the same fossil beds reveals there was more diversity there than we previously recognized, said team member Prof. Catherine Forster, of the George Washington University. Additionally, the paleontologists studied the relationship between the newly discovered species and other ceratopsians through phylogenetic analysis. The phylogeny and the earliest Late Jurassic age of Yinlong and Hualianceratops imply that at least five ceratopsian lineages Yinlong, Hualianceratops, Chaoyangsaurus and Xuanhuaceratops, Psittacosaurus, Neoceratopsia were present at the beginning of the Late Jurassic, they said.

The newly discovered mosasaur, named Phosphorosaurus ponpetelegans, comes from a creek in the town of Mukawa in northern Japan. Previous discoveries of Phosphorosaurus mosasaurs have occurred along the East Coast of North America, the Pacific Coast of North America, Europe and North Africa, but this is the first to fill the gap between the Middle East and the Eastern Pacific, said Dr Takuya Konishi of the University of Cincinnati. Measuring about 10 feet 3 m long, this marine reptile lived during the Late Cretaceous period just before the last of the dinosaurs such as T.rex and Triceratops, said Dr Konishi. He was the lead author of a report published this week on Phosphorosaurus ponpetelegans in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. The paleontologists determined that this small mosasaur had binocular vision  its eyes were on the front of the face, providing depth perception. The long and laterally projecting jugal processes, when combined with a depressed as well as narrow snout, provide compelling evidence for well developed binocular vision for the new mosasaur, with BFoV an estimated binocular field of view of 35 degrees, they said. The forward facing eyes on Phosphorosaurus ponpetelegans provide depth perception to vision, and its common in birds of prey and other predatory mammals that dwell among us today, Dr Konishi added. The team believes Phosphorosaurus ponpetelegans a phosphorus lizard from an elegant creek hunted at night, much like the owl does compared with the daytime birds of prey such as eagles. The binocular vision in nocturnal animals doubles the number of photoreceptors to detect light. And, much like owls with their very large eyes to power those light receptors, the smaller mosasaur revealed very large eye sockets. Also, because fossils of lantern fish and squid like animals have been found from the Late Cretaceous of northern Japan, and because their modern counterparts are bioluminescent, Dr Konishi and his colleagues believe that Phosphorosaurus ponpetelegans may have specifically targeted those glowing fish and squids at night while their larger underwater cousins hunted in daytime. If this new mosasaur was a sit and wait hunter in the darkness of the sea and able to detect the light of these other animals, that would have been the perfect niche to coexist with the more established mosasaurs, Dr Konishi said.

The group, led by University of Utah paleontologist Dr Randall Irmis, applied radioactive isotope measurements to date zircon crystals found in the sediments of the Argentinian Cha\u00f1ares Formation. The paleontologists found that the formation, and therefore the fossils of early dinosauromorphs found in it, is 234 to 236 million years old Triassic period  5 to 10 million years younger than previous estimate. To discover that these early dinosaur relatives were geologically much younger than previously thought was totally unexpected, said Dr Irmis, who is a co author of a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. He and his colleagues collected two rock samples from the formation  one from the base of the level where fossils were preserved and one from near the formations top. The Cha\u00f1ares Formation contains tuffs, or volcanic ashes, that can be dated with great accuracy, said study lead author Dr Claudia Marsicano, of the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. So in this basin, not only are there many high quality, complete fossils that allow us to easily identify taxa, but there are also tuffs in between that allow us to date the entire column. The rock samples include volcanic ash that erupted from volcanoes at the same time the sediments were deposited. The samples were then crushed to extract zircon crystals from this ash. When these crystals formed during the Triassic Period, they only incorporated uranium over time, some of this uranium decayed into lead at an exact known rate. By measuring the uraniumlead ratio in each zircon crystal with a mass spectrometer, the team was able to determine the precise date age the crystals formed. The radioisotopic dating demonstrated that the base formation sample is no older than 236 million years old and the top layer is no older than 235 million years old, with a possibility of being as young as 234 million years old. This demonstrates that the time elapsed between the appearance of early dinosaur relatives and the origin of dinosaurs is much shorter than previously thought. The results also call the timelines of a wide variety of other fossil bearing formations across the world, all believed to be from the Middle Triassic Period, into question.

Palaeomerycid ruminants, now extinct, were strange three horned Eurasian mammals known through fossils from Spain to China. The first remains of palaeomerycids were originally described on the basis of middle Miocene fossils from Georgensm\u00fcnd, Germany. Subsequently, such fossils have been found in other parts of Europe and China. The group is particularly well known from the middle Miocene of the Iberian Peninsula, displaying a good diversity of forms. Some of these Spanish remains are among the best palaeomerycid specimens described. A team of German and Spanish paleontologists has now described the beautifully preserved remains of a new palaeomerycid species from the middle Miocene fossil site of La Retama, Cuenca province, Spain. The teams leading scientist, Dr Israel S\u00e1nchez of the National Museum of Natural History in Madrid, said the new species is called, Xenokeryx amidalae, after a character from Star Wars. Referred to the fictional character Padme Amidala from Star Wars, due to the striking resemblance that the occipital appendage of Xenokeryx bears to one of the hairstyles that the aforementioned character shows in The Phantom Menace feature film. A detailed description of Xenokeryx amidalae appears in the December 2 online edition of the journal PLoS ONE. Dr S\u00e1nchez and his colleagues also explored the phylogenetic relationships among known forms of palaeomerycids to understand their evolution and reassess their systematics. The paleontologists found that despite their apparent external similarities, Eurasian palaeomerycid ruminants are not closely related to North American dromomerycids distant relatives of deer, as some scientists have thought. We find that Eurasian palaeomerycids are not closely related to North American dromomerycids, thus rejecting the currently more accepted view of palaeomerycids as the Eurasian part of the dromomerycid lineage, Dr S\u00e1nchez and co authors said. Instead of this, palaeomerycids are nested with the African Miocene pecoran Propalaeoryx and with giraffoids. Establishing the place of palaeomerycids in the ruminant tree gives us insights into the evolutionary history of the large clade of pecoran ruminants that include giraffes Giraffa and Okapia as its only extant survivors, and shows us the amazing diversity of an ancient lineage that inhabited both Eurasia and Africa, Dr S\u00e1nchez added.

The Jehol Biota is a rich Cretaceous ecosystem preserved in a multi layered rock formation cropping out in the Chinese provinces of Liaoning, Hebei and Inner Mongolia. A huge variety of ancient organisms became fossilized there 125 million years ago. Over the course of the last two decades, a large number of turtle fossils were recovered from the Jehol Biota but very few of them were described. Dr Chang Fu Zhou of the Shenyang Normal University and Dr M\u00e1rton Rabi of the University of T\u00fcbingen and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences have now identified a new species of Jehol turtle and named it\u00a0Xiaochelys ningchengensis. According to a new paper published in the journal Scientific Reports, this new species is so unique that it also represents a new genus. Dr Rabi and Dr Zhou also investigated its possible relationship with todays chelonians turtles, tortoises, and terrapins. They wanted to test a hypothesis that the Jehol turtles belong to a lineage that eventually gave rise to todays sea turtles. According to our findings, the Jehol turtles are instead found on the lineage leading to the cryptodiran turtles, Dr Zhou said. The cryptodires  which also include sea turtles  are able to pull their heads and necks vertically into their shells using an S shaped motion. However, a placement of the Jehol turtles close to sea turtles on the family tree is only slightly less supported statistically. Therefore, the earliest known sea turtles are likely to have looked much like the species found in the Jehol Biota, Dr Rabi added. These well preserved fossils give us insights into the origin of cryptodires. About three quarters of todays turtles belong to that group, Dr Zhou said. It remains unclear, however, just how the main adaptations of sea turtles arose for a marine habitat. These evolutionary changes included the reduction of their skeleton and the development of large and rigid paddles which enable the creatures to swim in a style which is best described as underwater flight. The origin of sea turtles was a major morphological transition in vertebrate evolution but we still dont really understand how it happened, Dr Rabi said. It was a highly successful adaptation and it is truly depressing to see that the last surviving marine reptiles are threatened with extinction after more than 130 million years.

The discovery provides important evidence for the origins and evolution of the modern fruit. Peach Prunus persica is a universally known tree fruit with an annual production near 20 million tons. This fruit is widely thought to have originated in China, but the oldest evidence had been archeological records dating back 7,000 8,000 years. According to the team, led by Dr Tao Su of Xishuangbanna Tropical Garden and the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, the word peach has long appeared in Chinese literature, e.g., the books Shi Jing 1,100  600\u2009BC and Shi Ji 1st century BC. Despite the significant fossil record of Rosaceae and the genus Prunus, the origins of the peach and its unique features remain unknown, the researchers said. No wild population has been confirmed, and the long history of trade and complex genomics of peach cultivars present considerable obstacles. Prof. Peter Wilf, a team member and a paleontologist at Pennsylvania State University, added the peach is an important part of human history, and its important to understand how it became what it is today. If we know the origins of our resources we can make better use of them. Dr Su, Prof. Wilf and their colleagues discovered the fossilized peaches in Kunming, Yunnan, southwestern China, when some road construction exposed a rock outcrop from the late Pliocene. We found these peach endocarp fossils just exposed in the strata. It is really a fantastic finding, they said. The scientists identified the fossils, documented them as a new species of the genus Prunus, and named it P. kunmingensis. Its the first discovery of fossilized peaches, and it supports China being the home of the peach. Is the peach we see today something that resulted from artificial breeding under agriculture since prehistory, or did it evolve under natural selection? The answer is really both, Prof. Wilf said. Peaches evolved their modern morphology under natural selection, presumably involving large, frugivorous mammals such as primates. Much later, peach size and variety increased through domestication and breeding, the scientists explained. The findings were published November 26 in the journal Scientific Reports.

Dr Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist with the University of Edinburgh, and his colleagues identified the fossilized dinosaur footprints, large and small, in layers of rock, which would have been at the bottom of a shallow, salt water lagoon when the prints were made. We report the discovery of the most extensive dinosaur fossil site yet known in Scotland a coastal outcrop of the Duntulm Formation at Cairidh Ghlumaig, Skye that preserves numerous trackways of sauropod dinosaurs in multiple layers deposited in a lagoonal system, they wrote in a paper published this week in the Scottish Journal of Geology. The sauropod footprints were left in sediment nearly 170 million years ago Jurassic period. They are the first sauropod tracks to be found in Scotland. By analyzing their structure, Dr Brusatte and co authors found that the dinosaurs were early, distant relatives of more well known species, such as Brontosaurus and Diplodocus. The new tracksite from Skye is one of the most remarkable dinosaur discoveries ever made in Scotland, Dr Brusatte said. There are so many tracks crossing each other that it looks like a dinosaur disco preserved in stone. According to the team, the Isle of Skye dinosaurs likely grew to at least 50 feet 15 m in length and weighed more than 10 tons. Together with similar tracks found in other parts of the world, the Skye footprints reveal that sauropod dinosaurs spent lots of time in coastal areas and shallow water. It was previously thought that these massive dinosaurs were purely land dwellers. The new Skye tracks document multiple generations of sauropods living within the lagoonal environments of Jurassic Scotland, and along with other tracks found over the past two decades, suggest that sauropods may have frequented such environments, contrary to their image as land bound behemoths, the scientists said.

Research team leader Dr Tim Cleland of the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues demineralized a fragment of Brachylophosaurus canadensis leg bone. They then analyzed the demineralized bone with mass spectroscopy and found several distinct proteins from the cellular components of the blood vessels. One of these proteins, called myosin, is found in the smooth muscles associated with the walls of blood vessels. Dr Cleland and co authors confirmed their results by performing the same process with bones from chicken and ostrich, which are living relatives of the dinosaurs. In both the modern and ancient samples, peptide sequences matched those found in blood vessels. Peptide sequencing of Brachylophosaurus canadensis blood vessel extracts is consistent with peptides comprising extant archosaurian blood vessels and is not consistent with a bacterial, cellular slime mold, or fungal origin, the scientists wrote in a paper published November 23 in the Journal of Proteome Research. When all data are taken into consideration, the most parsimonious explanation is that these vessels, derived from demineralized dinosaur bone, are endogenous, they said. These data open the door for molecular characterization of biological components of other long extinct organisms. Dr Cleland added this study is the first direct analysis of blood vessels from an extinct organism, and provides us with an opportunity to understand what kinds of proteins and tissues can persist and how they change during fossilization.

Dr Nick Longrich, a paleontologist at the University of Bath, UK, encountered fossil in question in Yale Universitys Peabody Museum collections. The specimen  a fragment of a jaw bone  comes from a smaller cousin of the famous ceratopsian dinosaur Triceratops. According to a study published in the journal Cretaceous Research, this unusual specimen is the first ceratopsian dinosaur known from the Late Cretaceous period of eastern North America. The Black Creek ceratopsian represents a highly derived member of the Leptoceratopsidae, Dr Longrich said. Along with basal tyrannosauroids, hadrosaurines, ornithomimosaurs, and nodosaurs, it was part of a distinctive fauna that emerged during the Late Cretaceous in eastern North America. Because the fossil is incomplete, the paleontologist isnt able to identify the exact dinosaur species it belonged to. But the specimen shows a strange twist to the jaw, causing the teeth to curve downward and outwards in a beak shape. It is more slender than that of ceratopsid dinosaurs found in western North America, suggesting that these dinosaurs had a different diet to their western relatives, and had evolved along a distinct evolutionary path. During the Late Cretaceous period 100 to 66 million years ago, the land mass that is now North America was split in two continents by a sea, which ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean, Dr Longrich said. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia. However, few fossils of creatures from the eastern continent, Appalachia, have been found because these areas being densely vegetated, making it difficult to discover and excavate fossils. The presence of a highly specialized ceratopsian in eastern North America supports the hypothesis that Appalachia underwent an extended period of isolation during the Late Cretaceous, leading the evolution of a distinct dinosaur fauna dominated by basal tyrannosauroids, basal hadrosaurs, ornithimimosaurs, nodosaurs, and leptoceratopsids, Dr Longrich said. Appalachian vertebrate communities are most similar to those of Laramidia. However some taxa  including the Black Creek dinosaur and other leptoceratopsids  are also shared with western Europe, raising the possibility of a Late Cretaceous dispersal route connecting Appalachia and Europe.

The new findings, described in the journal Science Advances, show snakes did not lose their limbs in order to live in the sea, as was previously suggested. How snakes lost their legs has long been a mystery to scientists, but it seems that this happened when their ancestors became adept at burrowing, explained Dr Hongyu Yi of the University of Edinburgh, UK. Dr Yi and his colleague, Dr Mark Norell from the American Museum of Natural History, used CT scans to examine the bony inner ear of Dinilysia patagonica. We hypothesize that Dinilysia patagonica was a burrower and that crown snakes originated from burrowing ancestors. For an ecomorphic indicator for snake habits, we used the shape of the inner ear instead of anatomical features that are not often preserved in fossils, they said. The bony canals and cavities of Dinilysia patagonica, like those in the ears of modern burrowing snakes, controlled its hearing and balance. The scientists built 3D virtual models to compare the inner ears of the fossils with those of modern lizards and snakes. They found a distinctive structure within the inner ear of animals that actively burrow, which may help them detect prey and predators. This shape was not present in modern snakes that live in water or above ground. A burrowing life style predated modern snakes, but it remained as the main, if not exclusive, habit for basal lineages among crown snakes, Dr Yi and Dr Norell said. Both Dinilysia patagonica and the hypothetical ancestor of crown snakes have a large vestibule that is associated with low frequency hearing. This suggests that ancestrally, crown snakes were able to detect prey and predator via substrate vibrations. The findings help paleontologists fill gaps in the story of snake evolution, and confirm Dinilysia patagonica as the largest burrowing snake ever known. With a snout tail length exceeding 1.8 m, Dinilysia patagonica is the largest known burrowing snake, living or extinct, the paleontologists said. The findings also offer clues about a hypothetical ancestral species from which all modern snakes descended.

Known from a single specimen, Bathygnathus borealis has a long and intriguing taxonomic history. It is the second vertebrate fossil named from Canada Dendrepeton acadianum was named a few months earlier and the first non mammalian synapsid ever found. Originally collected on Prince Edward Island, Canada, in 1845, the Bathygnathus specimen was not formally named until 1853, and described in 1854 as the dentary of a bipedal saurian. Subsequently, it was erroneously considered a dinosaur until the specimen was recognized as a theriodont in 1876, and later identified as the partial snout of a sphenacodontid, Prof. Robert Reisz from the University of Toronto and his colleagues wrote in a paper in the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences. Using family trees and imaging techniques to see the internal anatomy of the fossil, Prof. Reisz and co authors found that the eight preserved teeth linked the fossil to the Dimetrodon group  the first terrestrial animal to have ziphodont teeth. These are blade like teeth with tiny serrations along the front and back of the teeth, similar to a steak knife, Prof. Reisz said. The roots of these teeth are very long, around double the length of the crowns. This type of tooth is very effective for biting and ripping flesh from prey. Dimetrodon borealis is actually more closely related to mammals than it is to dinosaurs. In fact, its believed they went extinct some 40 million years before the dinosaurs, said team member Dr Kirstin Brink, also of the University of Toronto.

Museum and Simon Fraser University. The fossilized remains of a previously unknown horntail wood wasp species were discovered in the McAbee Fossil Beds near Cache Creek, British Columbia, Canada. According to a report published last month in the journal Canadian Entomologist, the specimen  named Ypresiosirex orthosemos  also represents a completely new genus. The fossil horntail wood wasp resembles its modern relatives and is in remarkable condition. In terms of size it is gigantic, measuring almost 3 inches. Horntail wood wasps are forest pests today their young bore tunnels through wood to create gardens in which they grow the fungus that they eat, Dr Archibald and Dr Rasnitsyn said. A secretion the wasp then produces weakens the trees immune system, and the fungus emits plant poisons, eventually killing it. All of the elements that their modern relatives prefer today were in place in our region by the time of Ypresiosirex orthosemos, they said. Many of the trees and other plants that modern horntail wasp young burrow in have been found as fossils in the same locations as the ancient wasps, including fir, pine, spruce, hemlock, sequoia, cedar and possibly juniper, as well as a number of their preferred flowering plants such as maple, beech, hickory, ash, poplar, elm, and possibly oak. The climate was right for these insects, too, Dr Archibald and Dr Rasnitsyn said. Although the ancient forest grew during a phase of Earths history when much of the globe experienced tropical heat, because the southern interior of British Columbia was an upland of some significant elevation, the average temperature in the McAbee forest would have been much like that of modern Vancouver, temperatures that wasps find agreeable. The major difference is that the ancient winters were much milder, with few, if any, frost days across the region. In the same paper, Dr Archibald and Dr Rasnitsyn also described two new genera and three new species of sawflies from Republic, Washington, and McAbee, British Columbia.

The fossil forests in Svalbard were formed mainly of lycopod trees, better known for growing millions of years later in coal swamps that eventually turned into coal deposits. The forests grew near the equator during the Late Devonian, according to the paleontologists  Dr Chris Berry of Cardiff University and Prof. John Marshall of the University of Southampton. They were extremely dense, with very small gaps around between each of the trees, which probably reached roughly 13 feet 4 m high. In situ trees are represented by internal casts of arborescent lycopsids with cormose bases and small ribbon like roots occurring in dense stands spaced 8 inches 20 cm apart, identified as Protolepidodendropsis pulchra, Dr Berry and Prof. Marshall wrote in a paper published recently in the journal Geology. These fossil forests shows us what the vegetation and landscape were like on the equator 380 million years ago, as the first trees were beginning to appear on the Earth, Dr Berry said. The Middle to early Late Devonian transition from diminutive plants to the first forests is a key episode in terrestrialization, the scientists explained. The two major plant groups currently recognized in such transitional forests are pseudosporochnaleans small to medium trees showing some morphological similarity to living tree ferns and palms and archaeopteridaleans trees with woody trunks and leafy branches probably related to living conifers. We report a new type of transitional in situ Devonian forest based on lycopsid fossils from the Plantekl\u00f8fta Formation in Munindalen, Svalbard. The newly discovered forests could provide an insight into the cause of a 15 fold reduction in levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere around that time. During the Devonian period, it is widely believed that there was a huge drop in the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, from 15 times the present amount to something approaching current levels, Dr Berry said. The evolution of tree sized vegetation is the most likely cause of this dramatic drop in carbon dioxide because the plants were absorbing carbon dioxide through photosynthesis to build their tissues, and also through the process of forming soils.

The team, led by Prof. Rachel Wood of the University of Edinburghs School of GeoSciences, studied well preserved fossils of Namacalathus hermanastes  an extinct species of marine animal that lived during the Ediacaran period, approximately 550 million years ago  from limestones of the Nama Group, Namibia. The fossils reveal that Namacalathus hermanastes possessed a rigid skeleton made of calcium carbonate. Namacalathus hermanastes had an accretionary growth skeletal wall composed of a calcareous foliated ultrastructure together with columnar microlamellar inflections, Prof. Wood and co authors said. N. hermanastes additionally displays an internal organic rich wall layer similar to that found in brachiopods and an internal budding being expressed in a symmetrical, bilateral pattern. Until now, the oldest evidence of complex animals  which succeeded more primitive creatures that often resembled sponges or coral  came from the Cambrian Period, which began around 541 million years ago. Paleontologists had long suspected that complex animals had existed before then but, until now, they had no proof. This fossil has been known for a long time, and was assumed to have been a primitive animal, such as a sponge or coral, Prof. Wood said. This study suggests that it was, in fact, more advanced, he added. We have suspected that these complex animals were present in the Ediacaran, but this study provides the first proof. Genetic family tree data suggested that complex animals  known as bilaterians  evolved prior to the Cambrian period. The new findings suggest that they may have lived as early as 550 million years ago, during the late Ediacaran period. The results were published online November 4 in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

The extant black footed tree rat Mesembriomys gouldii, one of the largest murids found in Australia by John Gould from Mammals of Australia, vol. III, plate 4, part of the 3 volumes. The island of Timor, situated at the eastern end of the Indonesia archipelago, played host to an incredible diversity of giant rats spanning the late Quaternary, according to team leader Dr Julien Louys of the Australian National University. At least eight species of giant rats, representing four genera, have been identified by Dr Louys and co authors. Six of the species are entirely new to science. The biggest one was about 5 kg, about ten times the size of modern rats, Dr Louys said. Most of the rat remains were found in and immediately below archaeological deposits dated at 43,300  44,700 years. These are the largest known rats to have ever existed, Dr Louys said. They are what you would call megafauna. Just to put that in perspective, a large modern rat would be 500 g, he added. The earliest records of humans on the island date to 46,000 years ago, and they lived with Timors giant rats for thousands of years. Evidence of butchery from the earliest archaeological deposits to the late Holocene indicates giant murids were regular prey items for humans for tens of thousands of years, the scientists said. Direct dating indicates that the rats probably became extinct about 1,000 years ago. Their persistence through the Last Glacial Maximum, moderate environmental disturbances, and disruption by introduced species echoes the ecological responses of smaller mammals found on continents and islands with long and complex histories, Dr Louys and co authors said.

Almost all of our knowledge about land animals from this time, comes from a handful of regions in North America and western Europe, which were located near the equator. Now we finally have information about what kinds of animals were present in areas farther to the south, and their similarities and differences to the animals living near the equator, said Dr Kenneth Angielczyk from the Field Museum of Natural History, a team member and a co author of a paper in the journal Nature Communications. In the paper, Dr Angielczyk and his colleagues from the United States, Germany, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and the UK, described two new species of ancient carnivorous amphibians called dvinosaurs Dvinosauria. One of the new dvinosaur species, Timonya annae, was a small, fully aquatic amphibian with fangs and gills, looking something like a cross between a modern Mexican salamander and an eel. The other new species is Procuhy nazarienis, an amphibian whose name in the Timbira language of its Brazilian homeland means fire frog. In the same region as where the fossils of Timonya annae and Procuhy nazarienis were uncovered, the palenontologists also discovered fossils of Captorhinus aguti a small, herbivorous lizard like reptile that until now has only been found far away in North America and a collie sized amphibian whose closest relatives lived in later times in southern Africa. The fact that these species have also been found in modern day Brazil helps paleontologists paint a picture of the ways that animals spread during the Permian and how they colonized new areas. Fossils from classic areas in North America and Europe have been studied for over a century, but there are long standing questions about how different animal groups dispersed to other areas that we cant answer using just those fossils, Dr Angielczyk said. Exploration in understudied areas, such as northeastern Brazil, gives us a snapshot of life elsewhere that we can use for comparisons, he said. In turn, we can see which animals were dispersing into new areas, particularly as an ice age was ending in the southern continents and environmental conditions were becoming more favorable for reptiles and amphibians.

At 18 feet 5.5 m long, the new creature is among the largest of the carnivorous, two legged dinosaurs called dromaeosaurids, or raptors. This new predatory dinosaur fills the body size gap between smaller theropods and large tyrannosaurs that lived at this time, said team member Dr David Burnham, a paleontologist at the University of Kansas and a co author of a paper in the journal Paleontological Contributions. The dinosaur represents both a new genus and species, which Dr Burnham and his colleagues have named Dakotaraptor steini. Dakota, referring to the geographic location of the discovery as well as the Dakota First Nations Tribe, plus raptor, Latin for plunderer, they explained. The specific name honors paleontologist Walter W. Stein. The skeletal remains of an adult Dakotaraptor steini were extracted from rocks in the Hell Creek Formation in South Dakota in 2005. Other isolated bones of the species, as well as isolated teeth, were discovered at another location within the same quarry. This Cretaceous period raptor would have been lightly built and probably just as agile as the vicious smaller theropods, such as the Velociraptor, said lead author Dr Robert DePalma of the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History. The both fossils showed evidence of quill knobs where feathers would have been attached to the forearm of the dinosaur. This also demonstrates that flightlessness evolved several times in this lineage leading to modern birds. According to the team, Dakotaraptor steini would have been occasionally in direct competition with smaller tyrannosaurid dinosaurs such as young Tyrannosaurus rex or Nanotyrannus lancensis, which, at an adult length of 20  30 feet 6  9 m, were not much larger than the new species. The presence of this new predator expands our record of theropod diversity in latest Cretaceous Laramidia, and radically changes paleoecological reconstructions of the Hell Creek Formation, the scientists said. Dakotaraptor steini is also the third giant dromaeosaurid from the North American Cretaceous, and the most recent in the fossil record worldwide.

Dr Lautenschlager looked at Tyrannosaurus rex  a large sized meat eating theropod with a massively built skull and long teeth Allosaurus fragilis  a more lightly built but carnivorous theropod and Erlikosaurus andrewsi  a closely related but herbivorous member of the theropod family. Theropod dinosaurs, such a Tyrannosaurus rex or Allosaurus fragilis, are often depicted with widely opened jaws, presumably to emphasize their carnivorous nature, said Dr Stephan Lautenschlager of the University of Bristols School of Earth Sciences. Yet, up to now, no studies have actually focused on the relation between jaw musculature, feeding style and the maximal possible jaw gape. In his study, Dr Lautenschlager found that the feeding style and dietary preferences of theropod dinosaurs was closely linked to how wide they could open their jaws. All muscles, including those used for closing and opening the jaw, can only stretch a certain amount before they tear, the scientist said. This considerably limits how wide an animal can open its jaws and therefore how and on what it can feed. In order to fully understand the relation between muscle strain and jaw gape, Dr Lautenschlager simulated jaw opening and closing, while measuring the length changes in the digital muscles. Tyrannosaurus rex, Allosaurus fragilis and Erlikosaurus andrewsi were also compared to their living relatives, crocodiles and birds, for which muscle strain and maximal jaw gape are known. The study found that the two carnivorous theropod species were capable of a wide gape up to 90 degrees, while the plant eater was limited to small gape around 45 degrees. Between the two meat eaters, results show that Tyrannosaurus rex could produce a sustained muscle force for a wide range of jaw angles, which would be necessary for biting through meat and skin and crushing bone. We know from living animals that carnivores are usually capable of larger jaw gapes than herbivores, and it is interesting to see that this also appears to be the case in theropod dinosaurs, Dr Lautenschlager said. The results of this study were published online today in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

The new ape species, Pliobates cataloniae, challenges current views on the last common ancestor of the two groups extant hominoids, according to a paper published in the journal Science. We used to think that small apes evolved from larger bodied apes, but Pliobates cataloniae tells us that small and large apes may have co existed since hominoids originated, said Dr Sergio Alm\u00e9cija of the George Washington University and the Autonomous University of Barcelona, a team member and a co author of the paper. Alternatively, Pliobates cataloniae might indicate that great apes evolved from gibbon size ape ancestors. The incomplete skeleton of Pliobates cataloniae was found in 2011 in the Vall\u00e8s Pened\u00e8s Basin, northeast Iberian Peninsula, and was composed of 70 fossil remains. The fossil remains belong to an adult female that weighed between 4 and 5 kg, consumed soft fruits and moved through the forest canopy by climbing and suspending below branches, the paleontologists said. The discovery of Pliobates cataloniae fills a gap in the fossil record, giving scientists another piece of information about the evolution of great and small apes. They previously thought that great apes were present before small apes, mainly due to the lack of small apes and ancient gibbons in the fossil record. The newly discovered extinct ape has forced them to consider the role that small apes played in hominoid evolution. These remains clearly belong to an ape, but they are so small, Dr Alm\u00e9cija said. Then we realized, maybe we are looking at this the wrong way. Maybe some early ape ancestors were smaller than we thought.

The tyrannosaur long bone was recovered from the uppermost Cretaceous Lance Formation. The bone was found at the surface near a thin bonebed within a sandstone unit, explained Loma Linda University paleontologist Matthew McLain. The grooves were clearly those of an animal pulling the flesh off the bone  pulling in a direction perpendicular to the bone, in the same way humans eat a piece of fried chicken. But one groove stood out. It was located at the larger end of the bone and contained smaller parallel grooves caused by the diners head turning, so that the serrated edges of its teeth dragged across the bone, said McLain, who will be presenting the discovery on November 1, 2015, at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Baltimore. Serrated teeth rule out crocodiles and point directly to a theropod dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex, he said. The fact that the only large theropods found in the Lance Formation are two tyrannosaurs  Tyrannosaurus rex or Nanotyrannus lancensis  eliminates all interpretations but cannibalism. This has to be a tyrannosaur. Theres just nothing else that has such big teeth, McLain said. The direction of the grooves is consistent with getting flesh from bones off an animal that was quite dead at the time. The bones dont reveal whether the cannibal was scavenging or was also the killer of the tyrannosaur, McLain said. To our knowledge, this is the first description of tyrannosaur cannibalism in the Lance Formation, he said.

The partial skeleton of Ornithomimus sp. was discovered in the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta, Canada, in 2009. It is remarkable in the extent and quality of preservation of integumentary structures including feathers, according to a study published in the journal Cretaceous Research on October 28, 2015. This new specimen  the only third known feathered Ornithomimus specimen  is shedding light on the dinosaurs evolutionary adaptation to different environments. We are getting the newest information on what these dinosaurs may have looked like, how they maintained body temperatures, and the stages of feather evolution, said Aaron van der Reest, a student at the University of Alberta and lead author on the study. The plumage pattern in Ornithomimus is similar to that of Struthio camelus ostrich and other large palaeognaths, indicating a probable function in thermoregulation, the scientists said. We now know what the plumage looked like on the tail, and that from the mid femur down, it had bare skin, van der Reest said. This is the first report of such preserved skin forming a web from the femoral shaft to the abdomen, never before seen in non avian dinosaurs. Ostriches use bare skin to thermoregulate. Because the plumage on this specimen is virtually identical to that of an ostrich, we can infer that Ornithomimus was likely doing the same thing, using feathered regions on their body to maintain body temperature. It wouldve looked a lot like an ostrich, van der Reest said. In fact, this group of dinosaurs  known as ornithomimids  is commonly referred to as ostrich mimics. This specimen also tightens the linkages between dinosaurs and birds, in particular with respect to theropods, said co author Dr Alexander Wolfe, of the University of Albertas Department of Biological Sciences. There are so many components of the morphology of this fossil as well as the chemistry of the feathers that are essentially indistinguishable from modern birds. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists: Pleistocene Hyper-Carnivores Kept Giant Plant-Eaters in Check", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Oct 27, 2015", "doc": "For several decades, scientists have wondered how Pleistocene ecosystems 2.5 million to 11,700 years ago survived despite the presence of huge herbivores, such as mammoths, mastodons and giant ground sloths. Now, a team of researchers  led by a scientist from the University of California, Los Angeles UCLA  argues that the ecosystems were effectively saved by enormous predators hyper carnivores that helped keep the population of large plant eaters in check. Using several different techniques and data sources, Prof. Blaire Van Valkenburgh of UCLAs Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and her colleagues from the United States, South Africa and the UK, have found that the hyper carnivores such as lions, saber tooth cats and hyenas were very capable of killing young mammoths, mastodons and other species. Their findings are reported in a paper published online by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on October 26, 2015. Based on observations of living giant herbivores, such as elephants, rhinos, giraffes and hippos, scientists have generally thought that these species were largely immune to predation, mainly because of their large size as adults and strong maternal protection of very young offspring, Prof. Van Valkenburgh said. Data on modern lion kills of elephants indicates that larger prides are more successful and we argue that Pleistocene carnivore species probably formed larger prides and packs than are typically observed today  making it easier for them to attack and kill fairly large juveniles and young adult huge herbivores. Based on a series of mathematical models for the sizes of predators and prey in the late Pleistocene age, the scientists conclude that the largest cave hyena might have been able to take down a 5 year old juvenile mastodon weighing more than a ton. Hunting in packs, those hyenas could possibly bring down a 9 year old mastodon weighing two tons, Prof. Van Valkenburgh and co authors said. Their analysis estimated size ranges for Pleistocene predators based on the fossil record, including teeth. Well established formulas allow scientists to make a reasonable estimate of an animals size based on just the first molar. And in the fossil record, the one thing weve got a lot of is teeth, Prof. Van Valkenburgh said. The team developed formulas for the relationship of shoulder height to body mass from data published for modern captive elephants to estimate how large some of the herbivores found in fossil evidence would have been. Its hard to weigh an elephant you need a truck scale. And truck scales arent the easiest thing to lug around the African savannah, so field researchers monitor shoulder heights in tracing a growing elephants size, said co author Dr V. Louise Roth of Duke University. The difficulty is that, even with the best measurements, modern adult elephants with the same shoulder height may vary by as much as two times in body mass. Nonetheless, the team developed a range for what some of these shaggy plant eaters would weigh. From this, they calculated whether hyper carnivores might be able to capture an herbivore. Because there is no way to infer from the scant fossil evidence whether the carnivores hunted in packs, the scientists relied on estimated prey sizes and modeled the capacity of single predators and predators in groups to take them down. They conclude that juvenile mastodons and mammoths would indeed have been susceptible, especially if the carnivores were socially organized. Hunting in packs  as modern lions, hyenas and wolves still do  would have made even larger juveniles susceptible. Larger pack sizes, which may have been more common in the Pleistocene, further enhance hunting success, Prof. Van Valkenburgh said. Many scientists had thought that the populations of mammoths, mastodons and giant ground sloths were limited through evolution by changes in reproductive timing in response to shortages in resources like food and water. Todays large predators benefit their ecosystems in part by providing carcasses that feed an array of smaller species. The same was true during the Pleistocene, when keeping mega herbivore populations in check meant that there was more vegetation for smaller mammals and birds, the scientists said. The predators might even have had indirect effects on river ecosystems, because the banks of the rivers were not being denuded by mega herbivores and less likely to erode.

Named Arvinachelys goldeni, the remains of the weird turtle were found in Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, Utah. The turtles scientific name derives from arvina, a Latin word for pig fat or bacon, and chelys, Latin for tortoise, according to paleontologist Dr Joshua Lively, formerly of the Natural History Museum of Utah and now at the University of Texas at Austin, who is an author on the paper. And goldeni honors Jerry Golden, a volunteer fossil preparator at the Natural History Museum of Utah, who prepared the new holotype specimen. Arvinachelys goldeni lived in the Cretaceous period about 76 million years ago. The species grew up to two feet 60 cm in length and lived in lakes and rivers. Unlike any turtle ever found, its broad snout has two bony nasal openings. All other turtles have just one external nasal opening in their skulls the division between their nostrils is only fleshy. Its one of the weirdest turtles that ever lived, Dr Lively said. When Arvinachelys goldeni was alive, southern Utah looked more like present day Louisiana. The climate was wet and hot, and the landscape was dominated by rivers, bayous and lowland flood plains. It lived alongside tyrannosaurs, armored ankylosaurs, giant duck billed dinosaurs such as Gryposaurus and Parasaurolophus. The discovery also fills a gap in understanding the evolution of turtles. During the time of Arvinachelys goldeni, western North America was a huge island continent, Laramidia. A sea stretching from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico separated Laramidia from eastern North America. During the Late Cretaceous period, dinosaurs of southern Laramidia seem to have diversified in isolation from their relatives in the northern part of the continent. The apparent confinement of the newly discovered and other species of turtles to southern Laramidia fits that same pattern. It remains a mystery what kept northern and southern populations isolated from each other. The assumption has always been that organisms would be able to range over broad areas, Dr Lively said. A combination of rising sea levels and persistent changes in the climate might have created barriers to dispersal during the Cretaceous period. Joshua R. Lively. 2015.

The new species, Hakawai melvillei, lived approximately 17.5 million years ago early Miocene, a time when New Zealand was covered in subtropical forests and crocodiles roamed parts of the South Island. According to a paper published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, Hakawai melvillei was a representative of a large group of birds that comprises the South American seedsnipes Thinocoridae and the Australian Plains wanderer Pedionomidae. We were excited to discover that the fossil shorebird was not a typical wader, but more like an ancestral Plains wanderer, with some seedsnipe like features, said Dr Venesa De Pietri of Canterbury Museum, lead author of the paper. The Plains wanderer and seedsnipes are unusual shorebirds as they have adapted well to living on the land. Were happy to have found a fossil bird that provides a key morphological link between the two groups, Dr De Pietri said. The discovery of Hakawai melvillei has confirmed our thinking that the ancestors of the Plains wanderer and seedsnipes were wading birds, like most other shorebirds. It has also confirmed previous research Ive undertaken, with colleagues, that the Plains wanderer and seedsnipes evolved their terrestrial habits independently. The discovery sheds light on evolutionary processes at work when South America, Antarctica, Australia, and New Zealand were part of the southern supercontinent of Gondwana. Hakawai melvillei, the Australian Plains wanderer and the South American seedsnipe are all thought to have originated in East Gondwana. The new species probably became endemic to New Zealand when it drifted apart from the rest of Gondwana. The discovery adds to an emerging story of New Zealands important role in the evolution of birds in the Southern Hemisphere, said senior author Dr Trevor Worthy of Flinders University. Unfortunately, like crocodiles, turtles, and some tropical birds, which once inhabited New Zealand, the lineage represented by Hakawai melvillei is long gone. Were not sure what happened, but climatic and geographic changes during that time may have been partly responsible for its demise.

The team, led by Prof. Robert Eagle of the University of California, Los Angeles, believes the ancient reptiles were probably more active than modern day alligators and crocodiles, which can be energetic, but only for brief spurts. The evidence also shows that some dinosaurs had lower body temperatures than modern birds, their only living relatives, and were probably less active. Dr Eagle and his colleagues examined fossilized dinosaur eggshells from Argentina and Mongolia. Analyzing the shells chemistry allowed them to determine the temperatures at which the eggshells formed. This technique tells you about the internal body temperature of the female dinosaur when she was ovulating, said co author Dr Aradhna Tripati, a scientist at the Natural History Museum of Denmark and the University of Brest. This presents the first direct measurements of theropod body temperatures. The results were published online October 13 in the journal Nature Communications. The Mongolia shells, which are 71 million to 75 million years old, are from oviraptorid theropods  small dinosaurs that were related to Tyrannosaurus rex and birds. The eggshells from Argentine are from large titanosaur sauropods that lived 80 million years ago. The isotopic composition of the eggshells showed that oviraptorid dinosaurs had body temperatures of 90 degrees Fahrenheit 32 degrees Celsius  decidedly cooler than modern mammals and birds. The body temperatures of the larger sauropods were 100 degrees Fahrenheit 38 degrees Celsius. This finding  that larger dinosaurs maintained body temperatures like ours whereas smaller ones more closely resembled modern reptiles  has implications for our understanding of dinosaur physiology. Measuring cooler temperatures in small dinosaurs is the first evidence to suggest that at least some of them had lower basal metabolisms than most modern mammals and birds, and therefore the emergence of modern mechanisms of endothermy hadnt occurred in these dinosaurs, said study senior author Prof. John Eiler from California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California. Paleontologists have long debated whether dinosaurs were endotherms or ectotherms. The research indicates that the answer could lie somewhere in between. Some dinosaurs were not fully endotherms like modern birds. They may have been intermediate  somewhere between modern alligators and crocodiles, and modern birds. Thats the implication for the oviraptorid theropods, Prof. Eagle said. This could mean that they produced some heat internally and elevated their body temperatures above that of the environment, but didnt maintain as high temperatures or as controlled temperatures as modern birds. If dinosaurs were endothermic to a degree, they had more capacity to run around searching for food than alligators would. The team also analyzed fossil soils, including minerals that formed in the upper layers of soils on which the oviraptorid theropod nests were built. That enabled them to estimate that the environmental temperature in Mongolia shortly before the dinosaurs went extinct was 79 degrees Fahrenheit 26 degrees Celsius. The oviraptorid dinosaur body temperatures were higher than the environmental temperatures  suggesting they were not truly cold blooded, but intermediate, Dr Tripati said.

The Dragons Tomb dinosaur locality was discovered in 1947 in the Nemegt Formation of Mongolias Gobi Desert. The bone bed at this site has yielded numerous articulated skeletons of Saurolophus angustirostris. This dinosaur is particularly abundant in the whole Nemegt Formation, comprising approximately 20 percent of all vertebrate fossils found. In a new report published in the journal PLoS ONE, paleontologists describe three or four perinatal specimens of Saurolophus angustirostris and two associated eggshell fragments. The young dinosaurs were likely part of a nest originally located on a river sandbank. The skull length of these Saurolophus angustirostris was around 5 percent that of the largest known S. angustirostris specimens, indicating that these specimens were in the earliest development stages. The perinatal bones already resembled Saurolophus angustirostris characteristics, including the upwardly directed snout, the paleontologists explained. The specimens did not yet have the characteristic cranial crest at the top of the head and areas of the skull the cervical neural arches were not yet fused, which suggest they may be in the earliest stages of the development of S. angustirostris. The poorly developed crest in Saurolophus angustirostris babies provides evidence of ontogenetic crest growth within the Saurolophini tribe, said lead author Dr Leonard Dewaele, of Ghent University and the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. The Saurolophini are the only Saurolophinae to bear supra cranial crests as adults. The paleontologists cant tell whether Saurolophus angustirostris babies were still in the eggs or had just hatched when they died, but they were apparently already dead and partly decomposed when they were buried by river sediment during the wet summer season. The fossilized eggshell fragments associated with the perinatal individuals closely resemble those found from Saurolophus angustirostris relatives in Mongolia. The team suggests these specimens may bridge a gap in our knowledge of the development of Saurolophus angustirostris.

According to the team, the discovery pushes back the earliest record of preserved mammalian hair structures and inner organs by more than 60 million years. The specimen, named Spinolestes xenarthrosus, was fossilized with remarkably intact guard hairs, underfur, tiny hedgehog like spines and even evidence of a fungal hair infection. Spinolestes xenarthrosus is a spectacular find. It is stunning to see almost perfectly preserved skin and hair structures fossilized in microscopic detail in such an old fossil, said Dr Zhe Xi Luo of the University of Chicago. This Cretaceous furball displays the entire structural diversity of modern mammalian skin and hairs. Spinolestes xenarthrosus lived in what is now Spain in the Cretaceous period, about 125 million years ago. It belonged to Eutriconodonta triconodonts, an order of early mammals The animal when alive was about 9.5 inches 24 cm long and weighed 50 to 70 grams, about the size of a modern day juvenile rat. Its teeth and skeletal features indicate it was a ground dweller that ate insects. Its soft tissues, with discernable microscopic structures, were preserved through a process known as phosphatic fossilization. Individual hair follicles and bulbs, as well as the composition of individual hair shafts, could be identified using an electron scanning microscope. According to the paleontologists, Spinolestes xenarthrosus had remarkably modern mammalian hair and skin structures, such as compound follicles in which multiple hairs emerge from the same pore. It had small spines around a tenth of a millimeter in diameter on its back. We are familiar with these characteristics in modern spiny mice from Africa and Asia Minor. If a predator grabs them by the back, the spines detach from the skin. The mouse can escape and the attacker is left with nothing more than a mouthful of spines, said Prof. Thomas Martin of the University of Bonn, Germany. The scientists even found abnormally truncated hairs that are evidence of a fungal skin infection known as dermatophytosis, which is widely seen among living mammals. Hairs and hair related integumentary structures are fundamental to the livelihood of mammals, and this fossil shows that an ancestral, long extinct lineage had grown these structures in exactly the same way that modern mammals do, Dr Luo said. Spinolestes xenarthrosus gives us a spectacular revelation about this central aspect of mammalian biology. The finding comes from the Las Hoyas Quarry in east central Spain, which has primarily been known up to now for its well preserved bird and reptile fossils. However, in 2011, the paleontologists encountered the fossilized skeleton of a previously unknown mammal there. Spinolestes xenarthrosus is also the first example of a Mesozoic mammal in which soft tissues in the thoracic and abdominal cavities are fossilized. The paleontologists noted microscopic bronchiole structures of the lung, as well as iron rich residues associated with the liver. These areas were separated by a curved boundary that is thought to be a muscular diaphragm for respiration. This represents the earliest known record of mammalian organ systems. The fossil of Spinolestes xenarthrosus contains a large external ear, the earliest known example in the mammalian fossil record, as well as dermal scutes  plate like structures made of skin keratin. The animal had extra articulations between vertebrae, which strengthened its spinal column  modern day mammals such as armored shrews and armadillos possess similar articulations. The scientists speculate that this might provide a clue as to the animals lifestyle. Similar structures are found today in armadillos and anteaters but also in the African hero shrew. For instance, the hero shrew uses its strong back to break off palm fronds from the trunk of the tree. In this way, it can reach insect larvae living between the attachment points of the fronds and the trunk, Prof. Martin said. He added 125 million years ago, Spinolestes xenarthrosus was very well adapted to its ecological niche  through horny scutes and spines on its back as well as through its reinforced spine. The fossil thus joins the ranks of an entire range of newer findings. We have to revise our thinking. Mammals were indeed very small during the time of the dinosaurs. But they were certainly not primitive. The discovery will be reported in the online edition of the journal Nature on October 15, 2015.

The team, headed by Dr Luis M. Chiappe of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, studied the exceptionally well preserved right wing of a 125 million year old enantiornithine bird Lower Cretaceous from the limestones of Las Hoyas, Spain. Beyond the bones preserved in the fossil, the tiny wing of this bird reveals details of a complex network of muscles that in modern birds controls the fine adjustments of the wings main feathers, allowing birds to master the sky. The presence of these structures in the wing of such a primitive bird supports the notion that at least some of the most ancient birds were capable of performing aerodynamic feats in a fashion similar to those of many living birds. Its very surprising that despite being skeletally quite different from their modern counterparts, these primitive birds show striking similarities in their soft anatomy, said Guillermo Naval\u00f3n, a Ph.D. student at the University of Bristol. The anatomical match between the fibers preserved in the fossil and those that characterize the wings of living birds strongly indicates that some of the earliest birds were capable of aerodynamic prowess like many present day birds, Dr Chiappe added. Primitive birds may have flown over the heads of dinosaurs but some aspects of the precise flight modes of these early fliers still remain unclear.

The study, published online in the journal Royal Society Open Science, shows the specifics of the evolutionary transformation in extinct species within the giraffe family. First, only the front portion of the C3 vertebra lengthened in one group of species, explained study senior author Dr Nikos Solounias from the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine. The second stage was the elongation of the back portion of the C3 neck vertebra. The modern giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis is the only species that underwent both stages, which is why it has a remarkably long neck, he said. Dr Solounias and his colleagues at the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine studied 71 fossils of nine extinct and two living species in the giraffe family. We also found that the most primitive giraffe already started off with a slightly elongated neck, said co author Melinda Danowitz. The lengthening started before the giraffe family was even created 16 million years ago. But the main discovery came after the scientists analyzed anatomical features of the various fossils and compared them to the evolutionary tree. They found the cranial end of the vertebra stretched initially around 7 million years ago in an extinct relative of giraffe known as Samotherium. That was followed by a second stage of elongation on the back or caudal portion around one million years ago. As the modern day giraffes neck was getting longer, the neck of another member of the giraffe family, the okapi Okapia johnstoni, was shortening. The species is the only other living member of the giraffe family. Yet, rather than evolving a long neck, this species is one of four with a secondarily shortened neck, placing it on a different evolutionary pathway, Dr Danowitz said.

The newly discovered creature belongs to the order Desmostylia, a group of extinct marine mammals whose closest living relatives are elephants, sea cows and manatees. Desmostylian mammals were large bodied herbivores with enhanced adaptations for life in water and bulk aquatic feeding. They lived around the margins of the North Pacific Ocean from the Oligocene until the end of the Miocene, 32.5 to 10.5 million years ago. Unlike whales and seals, but like manatees, they were vegetarians. They rooted around coastlines, ripping up vegetation, such as marine algae, sea grass and other near shore plants. They probably swam like polar bears, using their strong front limbs to power along, and walked on land a bit, lumbering like a sloth. The new desmostylian genus and species was named Ounalashkastylus tomidai by a team of paleontologists from Japan, Canada and the United States. Ounalashka means near the peninsula in the Aleut language of the indigenous people of the Aleutian Islands. Stylus is from the Latin for column and refers to the shape of cusps in the teeth, explained team member Prof. Louis Jacob of Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Tomida honors distinguished Japanese vertebrate paleontologist Yukimitsu Tomida. A detailed description of Ounalashkastylus tomidai appears in the special issue of the Historical Biology An International Journal of Paleobiology. The extinct mammal had a long snout and tusks. It also possessed a unique tooth and jaw structure that indicates it was not only a vegetarian, but literally sucked vegetation from shorelines like a vacuum cleaner. The new animal made us realize that desmostylians do not chew like any other animal. They clench their teeth, root up plants and suck them in, Prof. Jacob said. To eat, the animals buttressed their lower jaw with their teeth against the upper jaw, and used the powerful muscles that attached there, along with the shape of the roof of their mouth, to suction feed vegetation from coastal bottoms. Big muscles in the neck would help to power their tusks, and big muscles in the throat would help with suction. He added no other mammal eats like that. The enamel rings on the teeth show wear and polish, but they dont reveal consistent patterns related to habitual chewing motions. The Unalaska fossils represent at least four individuals, and one is a baby. The baby tells us they had a breeding population up there. They must have stayed in sheltered areas to protect the young from surf and currents, Prof. Jacobs said. In addition, the baby also tells us that this area along the Alaska coast was biologically productive enough to make it a good place for raising a family, said co author Dr Anthony Fiorillo of the Perot Museum of Nature and Science and Southern Methodist University. The discovery of Ounalashkastylus tomidai indicates the desmostylian group was larger and more diverse than previously known.

The newly discovered mammal, Kimbetopsalis simmonsae, comes from fossil rich beds of the Nacimiento Formation, New Mexico. According to the UK and American paleontologists who studied this new mammal, it was a member of a group of extinct small, furry mammals called the multituberculates. These rodent like creatures, which originated some 100 million years before the dinosaurs were killed off, were distinctive in having strange and complex teeth multituberculate refers to the multiple rows of cusps found on the animals teeth. Their sharp incisors and molars with lots of cusps were suited to their diet of plants and leaves. The group survived the events that led to the demise of dinosaurs, and spread through what is now Asia and North America. These mammals finally died out about 35 million years ago, when they were replaced by emerging rodents. Kimbetopsalis simmonsae was about the size of a beaver and may have been an evolutionary ancestor of \u202dthe bigger sized multituberculate mammal Taeniolabis taoensis weighed up to 100 kg. The species description was published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society by Dr Thomas Williamson of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science and co authors. Finding this new mammal was a pleasant surprise, Dr Williamson said. It helps fill an important gap in the record of this group of mammals. Its interesting that this odd, now extinct group, was among the few to survive the mass extinction and thrive in the aftermath. It may be because they were among the few mammals that were already well suited to eating plants when the extinction came, he said. This new species helps to show just how fast they were evolving to take advantage of conditions in the post extinction world. We could think of Kimbetopsalis simmonsae as a primeval beaver, which lived only a few hundred thousand years after the asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs, said co author Dr Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh, UK. The asteroid caused apocalyptic environmental change, but it seems like mammals began to recover pretty quickly afterwards.

The fish, named Rhegmaspis xiphoidea, belongs to an extinct group of jawless marine and freshwater fish called galeaspids, characterized by their big and bizarre head shields. The species swam in Devonian period seas about 410 million years ago, long before dinosaurs lived on Earth, according to a study published in the journal Vertebrata PalAsiatica. It had a torpedo shaped head shield with a breathing hole on top and a sword like nose. The complete fish would have been 2 to 2.8 inches 5 7 cm long when it was alive. Dr Zhi Kun Gai of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing and co authors made the discovery in rocks on the Posongchong Formation in Yunnan Province, China. The fossil specimens of Rhegmaspis xiphoidea that the paleontologists used to characterize this new genus and species come from multiple individuals and include complete head shields and one incomplete endocast of a skull. As a streamlined jawless fish, Rhegmaspis xiphoidea displays an adaptation for a suprabenthic lifestyle with more active feeding behavior among galeaspids, Dr Gai said. The new form not only enriches the diversity of the Huananaspiformes, but also provides evidence for the last adaptive radiation of galeaspids by occupying an unexploited ecological niche during the Pragian of the Early Devonian.

The new measurements of Deccan volcanic activity indicate a dramatic increase in the rate of eruption of the volcanoes within 50,000 years of the Chicxulub impact. The team, led by Prof. Paul Renne of the University of California Berkeley, used high resolution argon dating of local igneous minerals. Based on our dating of the lavas, we can be pretty certain that the volcanism and the impact occurred within 50,000 years of the extinction, so it becomes somewhat artificial to distinguish between them as killing mechanisms both phenomena were clearly at work at the same time, explained Prof. Renne, lead author of a paper published in the journal Science. It is going to be basically impossible to ascribe actual atmospheric effects to one or the other. They both happened at the same time. The data, combined with the layering of rock, reveal that some subsections of the Deccan Traps region were already active before the asteroidcomet hit. Following the collision, the mean eruption frequency of a particular subsection decreased dramatically, but the lava volume per single eruptive event increased, causing the mean magma eruption rate to roughly double. The transition from high frequency, low volume eruptions to low frequency, high volume eruptions suggests a fundamental change in the magma plumbing system, Prof. Renne and his colleagues said. This large volume of magma continued for 500,000 years after the end Cretaceous mass extinction, which is similar to the timescale between extinction and the initial recovery of marine ecosystems. Therefore, the extinction may have resulted from the combined effects of both the asteroid collision and increased volcanic activity. If our high precision dates continue to pin these three events  the impact, the extinction and the major pulse of volcanism  closer and closer together, people are going to have to accept the likelihood of a connection among them, said Prof. Mark Richards, also from the University of California Berkeley. The scenario we are suggesting  that the impact triggered the volcanism  does in fact reconcile what had previously appeared to be an unimaginable coincidence.

The discovery was announced in the latest issue of the Journal of Medical Entomology. Dr Poinar determined that the flea, named Atopopsyllus cionus, is entirely new to science. It was preserved in a piece of 20 million year old amber from amber mines in the northern mountain range Cordillera Septentrional of the Dominican Republic. Its basic characteristics are so strange that it deserves its own genus, Dr Poinar said. And in fact, the genus name the scientist has applied to the insect means strange flea in Greek. The specimen also shows the connection between insects and pathogenic microorganisms. Ive spent a lot of time looking for pathogens that are vectored by insects in amber. I was quite excited when we found pathogens inside the flea in the anal area, Dr Poinar said. We found bacteria that have the characteristics of bubonic plague bacteria Yersinia pestis. We cant say theyre plague bacteria. All we can say is their morphology is similar to that which is shown to be associated with plague. If indeed the fossil bacteria are related to plague bacteria, the discovery would show that this scourge, which killed more than half the population of Europe in the 14th century, actually had been around for millions of years before that, traveled around much of the world, and predates the human race. They are a coccobacillus bacteria they are seen in both rod and nearly spherical shapes and are similar to those of Yersinia pestis. Of the pathogenic bacteria transmitted by fleas today, only Yersinia has such shapes. Aside from physical characteristics of the fossil bacteria that are similar to plague bacteria, their location in the rectum of the flea is known to occur in modern plague bacteria, Dr Poinar said. And in this fossil, the presence of similar bacteria in a dried droplet on the proboscis of the flea is consistent with the method of transmission of plague bacteria by modern fleas. These findings are in conflict with modern genomic studies indicating that the flea plague vertebrate cycle evolved only in the past 20,000 years, rather than 20 million. However, today there are several strains of Yersinia pestis, and there is evidence that past outbreaks of this disease were caused by still different strains, some of which are extinct today. While human strains of Yersinia could well have evolved some 10,000 to 20,000 years ago, ancient Yersinia strains that evolved as rodent parasites could have appeared long before humans existed. These ancient strains would certainly be extinct by now, Dr Poinar said. The researcher also found trypanosomes in the specimen. So we know that this flea was vectoring at least two pathogens. It shows that even back at that time, pathogens were established in fleas in the West Indies. They could have affected rodents because we found rodent hair in the amber. This shows the antiquity of the relationship between vector, host, and pathogen, he explained.

The team, headed by Dr Jakob Vinther of the University of Bristol, UK, determined the color of two species of bat  Palaeochiropteryx sp. and Hassianycteris sp., which lived in Eocene, 56 33.9 million years ago. By studying microscopic spherical and oblong shaped structures in the fossils, the scientists found that the bats were reddish brown in color. Microscopic structures traditionally believed to be fossilized bacteria are in fact melanosomes  organelles within cells that contain melanin, the pigment that gives colors to hair, feathers, skin, and eyes, Dr Vinther and co authors explained. Fossil melanosomes were first described in a fossil feather in 2008 by Dr Vinther. Since then, the shapes of melanosomes have been used to look at how marine reptiles are related and identify colors in dinosaurs and, now, mammals. Very importantly, we see that the different melanins are found in organelles of different shapes reddish melanosomes are shaped like little meatballs, while black melanosomes are shaped like little sausages and we can see that this trend is also present in the fossils, Dr Vinther said. This means that this correlation of melanin color to shape is an ancient invention, which we can use to easily tell color from fossils by simply looking at the melanosomes shape. In addition to shape, melanosomes are chemically distinct. In order to identify the origin of these structures, the team replicated the conditions under which the fossils formed using high pressure, high temperature autoclave experiments. They showed that the fossils contain fossilized melanin by using Time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy, which had changed in chemical composition over time. By incorporating these experiments, we were able to see how melanin chemically changes over millions of years, establishing a really exciting new way of unlocking information previously inaccessible in fossils, said team member Caitlin Colleary, a PhD student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. This is a great leap forward in our understanding of how fossils are preserved. We now know how melanin is preserved and we have the methods to confidently detect it, Dr Vinther added. The study was published online September 28 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "}, {"title": " New Study Sheds Light on Origin of Enamel", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Sep 24, 2015", "doc": "According to a new study, published this week in the journal Nature, enamel evolved in the skin and colonized the teeth much later. Enamel is the hardest substance produced by the human body, composed almost entirely of the mineral apatite calcium phosphate deposited on a substrate of three unique enamel matrix proteins. Like other land vertebrates humans only have teeth in the mouth, but certain fishes such as sharks also have tiny tooth like scales dermal denticles on the outer surface of the body. In many fossil bony fishes, and a few archaic living ones such as the spotted gar Lepisosteus oculatus, the scales are covered with an enamel like tissue called ganoine. A group of scientists from Uppsala University in Sweden and the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in China investigated the genome of the spotted gar and found that it contains genes for two of our three enamel matrix proteins the first to be identified from a ray finned bony fish. Furthermore, these genes are expressed in the skin, strongly suggesting that ganoine is a form of enamel. But where did enamel originate  in the mouth, in the skin, or both at once? The answer to that question is provided by two prehistoric fishes  Psarolepis romeri from the Devonian of China and Andreolepis from the Silurian of Sweden. In Psarolepis romeri the scales and the denticles of the face are covered with enamel, but there is no enamel on the teeth in Andreolepis only the scales carry enamel. We show that Psarolepis romeri, a bony fish from the Early Devonian period, combines enamel covered dermal odontodes on scales and skull bones with teeth of naked dentine, and that Lepisosteus oculatus has enam and ambn genes that are expressed in the skin, probably associated with ganoine formation, the scientists wrote in the Nature paper. The fossil evidence, further supported by the Silurian bony fish Andreolepis, which has enamel covered scales but teeth and odontodes on its dermal bones made of naked dentine, indicates that this tissue originated on the dermal skeleton, probably on the scales. Prof. Per Ahlberg of Uppsala University, senior author on the study, explained Psarolepis romeri and Andreolepis are among the earliest bony fishes, so we believe that their lack of tooth enamel is primitive and not a specialization. It seems that enamel originated in the skin, where we call it ganoine, and only colonized the teeth at a later point. The study is the first to combine novel paleontological and genomic data in a single analysis to explore tissue evolution.

The team, directed by Dr Gilbert Price of the University of Queensland, unearthed the first evidence that Australias first human inhabitants and giant apex predator lizards had overlapped. Our jaws dropped when we found a tiny fossil from a giant lizard during a two meter deep excavation in one of the Capricorn Caves, near Rockhampton, Queensland said Dr Price, lead author of a paper to be published in the October 2015 issue of the journal Quaternary Science Reviews. The one centimeter bone, an osteoderm, came from under the lizards skin and is the youngest record of a giant lizard on the entire continent. The scientists used radiocarbon and uranium thorium techniques to date the bone as about 50,000 years old, coinciding with the arrival of Australias first human inhabitants. The new monitor fossil is, minimally, 30,000 years younger than the previous youngest reliably dated record for giant lizards in Australia and for the first time, demonstrates that on a continental scale, humans and giant lizards overlapped in time, they said. We cant tell if the bone is from a Komodo dragon  which once roamed Australia  or an even bigger species like the extinct Megalania monitor lizard Megalania prisca, which weighed about 500 kg and grew up to 20 feet 6 m long, Dr Price said. Even 30 foot 9 m long inland crocodiles roamed Australia during the last Ice Age in the Pleistocene geological period, he added. We unequivocally demonstrate that humans and giant monitor lizards overlapped temporally in Australia, and thus, humans can only now be considered potential drivers for their extinction, the scientists concluded.

The new lineage, named Pseudomegachasma, is represented by two extinct species  Pseudomegachasma casei formerly known as Eorhincodon casei from RFs Belgorod and Volgograd provinces and P. comanchensis formerly Megachasma comanchensis from the U.S. These sharks were 16 20 feet 5 6 m long and had small teeth very similar to the modern day megamouth shark Megachasma pelagios. Pseudomegachasma means false megamouth shark due to its dental features superficially nearly identical to the modern day, plankton eating megamouth shark, explained Prof. Shimada, who is the lead author of a paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. E. casei and M. comanchensis are two Cretaceous taxa initially described as putative planktivorous elasmobranchs, but the type specimens of these two taxa were subsequently reinterpreted to represent taphonomically abraded teeth of an odontaspidid, Johnlongia, Prof. Shimada and co authors wrote in the paper. We redescribe the type materials of E. casei and M. comanchensis and describe additional specimens of these species from other Late Cretaceous localities. These specimens demonstrate that i the two fossil taxa are valid species ii they warrant the establishment of a new genus of presumed planktivorous sharks, Pseudomegachasma. They added the new genus is sister to Johnlongia and together constitute a new subfamily Johnlonginae, tentatively placed in the family Odontaspididae. Pseudomegachasma sharks lived in warm oceans during the age of the dinosaurs about 100 million years ago. Pseudomegachasma would represent the oldest known plankton feeding shark in the fossil record, Prof. Shimada said. These sharks would have evolved independent of the four known lineages of modern day planktivorous cartilaginous fishes the megamouth sharks, basking sharks, whale sharks, and manta rays.

The new dinosaur, scientifically named Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis means ancient grazer of the Colville River was nearly 30 feet long and lived 69 million years ago in the Upper Cretaceous. Its skeletal remains were found along the Colville River in a geological formation known as the Prince Creek Formation. The remains were analyzed by a team of paleontologists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks, Florida State University and the University of Alaska Museum. According to the team, Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis was the northernmost dinosaur known to have ever lived. The majority of the bones of this species were collected from the Liscomb Bonebed. In this particular area, most of the skeletons were from juvenile dinosaurs, about 9 feet long and 3 feet tall at the hip. The paleontologists believe a herd of juvenile Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis was killed suddenly to create this deposit of remains. At the time Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis lived, the Prince Creek Formation was located well above the paleo Arctic circle, about 80 degrees north latitude. Arctic Alaska was covered in trees because Earths climate was much warmer as a whole. But, because it was so far north, the species likely contended with months of winter darkness, even if it wasnt as cold as a modern day winter. They lived in a world where the average temperature was about 43 degrees Fahrenheit 6 degrees Celsius, and they probably saw snow. Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, according to the paleontologists, is most closely related to Edmontosaurus, a hadrosaurid dinosaur that lived 70 million years ago in Alberta, Montana and South Dakota. But, the combination of features found in the new species was not present in Edmontosaurus or in any other species of duck billed dinosaurs. In particular, Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis had very unique skeletal structures in the area of the skull, especially around the mouth. Because many of the bones from our Alaskan species were from younger individuals, a challenge of this study was figuring out if the differences with other hadrosaurs was just because they were young, or if they were really a different species, said Dr Patrick Druckenmiller of the University of Alaska Fairbanks and the University of Alaska Museum, co author of a paper published in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. The discovery of Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis further clarifies the faunal composition of the Prince Creek Formation and contributes to a growing body of evidence that the paleo Arctic hosted a distinct and endemic polar, early Maastrichtian dinosaurian fauna, the scientists said.

Named Serenichthys kowiensis, the new speices is Africas earliest known coelacanth, according to paleontologists Prof. Michael Coates of the University of Chicago and Dr Robert Gess from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Coelacanths are believed to have arisen during the Devonian period 420 million years ago, however only five species of Devonian coelacanths have previously been described. None of these came from Africa, but rather from North America, Europe, China and Australia. Serenichthys kowiensis gives important additional information on the early evolution of coelacanths. According to our evolutionary analysis, it is the Devonian species that most closely resembles the line leading to modern coelacanths, said Gess, first author of a paper published online in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society of London. Several specimens of Serenichthys kowiensis were collected from the Late Devonian Waterloo Farm locality. Around 360 million years ago, Africa was part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, made up of Africa, India, Australia, Antarctica and South America. At that time, the rocks of Waterloo Farm were forming along the shores of the semi enclosed Agulhas Sea, not far from the South Pole. Remarkably, all of the delicate whole fish impressions represent juveniles, Dr Gess said. This suggests that Serenichthys kowiensis was using a shallow, waterweed filled embayment of the estuary as a nursery, as many fish do today. He added this earliest known record of a coelacanth nursery foreshadows a much younger counterpart, known from the 300 million year old Mazon Creek beds of Illinois in the U.S. This glimpse into the early life history of ancient coelacanths raises further questions about the life history of the modern coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae, which is known to bear live young, but whether they, too, are clustered in nurseries remains unknown, Prof. Coates said.

Bunostegos akokanensis belongs to Pareiasauria pareiasaurs, a group of plant eating reptiles that lived in the arid regions of the supercontinent Pangaea modern day Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa during the middle to late Permian, about 265  252 million years ago. Most pareiasaurs had bony knobs on their skulls, but Bunostegos akokanensis sported the largest, most bulbous ones ever discovered. In life, these were probably skin covered horns like those on the heads of modern giraffes. To date all of the known pareiasaurs were sprawlers whose limbs would jut out from the side of the body and then continue out or slant down from the elbow. Prof. Sidor and co authors expected Bunostegos akokanensis would be a sprawler, too, but the bones of the animals forelimbs tell a different story. A lot of the animals that lived around the time had a similar upright or semi upright hind limb posture, but whats interesting and special about Bunostegos akokanensis is the forelimb, in that its anatomy is sprawling precluding and seemingly directed underneath its body  unlike anything else at the time, said Morgan Turner of Brown University, team member and lead author on the study published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. The elements and features within the forelimb bones wont allow a sprawling posture. That is unique. The findings allowed the team to characterize how Bunostegos akokanensis might have looked standing like a cow, and about the same size. The paleontologists examined much of the skeleton of several individuals. The findings that matter most, however, are all in the forelimbs, Turner explained. In particular, four observations make the case that Bunostegos stood differently than all the rest, with the legs entirely beneath the body.

Nicknamed Lightning Claw, the new dinosaur lived roughly 110 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous period. It belongs to a group of large carnivorous theropod dinosaurs called Megaraptora megaraptorid theropods. The species grew up to 20 feet 6 m in length. It is the largest and only the second theropod dinosaur in Australia known from more than a single bone. The partial skeleton, including a foot bone, parts of the hip, ribs, forearm, and a giant claw from the hand, was discovered by miners Rob and Debbie Brogan in an underground mine at the Carters Rush opal field, 18.6 miles 30 km southwest of the town of Lightning Ridge, north central New South Wales. It was analyzed by a team of paleontologists from Australia and Italy, led by Dr Phil Bell of the University of New England. Some of the bones were recognized and manually removed by miners and eventually donated to the Australian Opal Centre in 2005, Dr Bell and co authors wrote in a paper published in the journal Gondwana Research. An unknown number of bones were not recognized and presumably destroyed prior to or during excavation of what was almost certainly a more complete skeleton than is currently represented. Dr Bell said I immediately recognized this fossil was something new. When I compared it to other Australian and South American dinosaurs, it was clear it was a megaraptorid which is relatively rare group of dinosaurs, mostly known from Argentina. The hand claw of the dinosaur would have been 10 inches 25 cm in length and would have been used like a grappling hook to catch its prey. What is fascinating about this discovery is it changes the popular notion that Australian dinosaurs came from ancestors derived from Africa and South America  instead the Lightning Claw appears to be the ancestor of all megaraptorids, meaning this group appeared first in Australia, Dr Bell said. This specimen provides new evidence that Australia played an active role in the evolution and radiation of at least one group of apex theropods. Significantly, the Australian origin of megaraptorid theropods is echoed by eusuchian crocodylomorphs wherein Isisfordia duncani from the earliest latest Lower Cretaceous of Queensland suggests the origin of this clade also has an Australian root, the scientists said.

Santanachelys gaffneyi is the oldest known sea turtle  this sentence from Wikipedia is no longer up to date. We described a fossil sea turtle from Colombia that is about 10 million years older, Dr Cadena said. The turtle described by us as Desmatochelys padillai originates from Cretaceous sediments and is at least 120 million years old. The partial skeleton of Desmatochelys padillai, with a length of nearly 6.5 feet 2 m, shows all of the characteristic traits of modern marine turtles, the paleontologists report online today in the journal PaleoBios. Sea turtles descended from terrestrial and freshwater turtles that arose 230 million years ago. During the Cretaceous period, they split into land and sea dwellers, Dr Cadena said. Fossil evidence from this time period is very sparse, however, and the exact time of the split is difficult to verify, he added. This lends a special importance to every fossil discovery that can contribute to clarifying the phylogeny of the sea turtles. The fossilized turtle shells and bones of Desmatochelys padillai were collected from two sites near the community of Villa de Leyva in Colombia.

The discovery was made after the team found a fossil tibia belonging to the species in an underwater cave in Altagracia Province, Dominican Republic. The Hispaniola monkey is a capuchin sized primate from the island of Hispaniola that went extinct around four hundred years ago. It was tree dwelling and lived largely on a diet of fruit and leaves. Very little was known about the native monkey from this island. Prior to our discoveries in Altagracia we knew almost nothing even though this species was first described by Renato R\u00edmoli back in 1977, said Dr Siobh\u00e1n Cooke of Northeastern Illinois University, a team member and a co author on a study that was published August 29, 2015 in the Journal of Human Evolution. Antillothrix bernensis is one of two species of extinct primate on Hispaniola. Previously discovered primate material has all been dated to within the last 10,000 years, said co author Dr Melissa Tallman of Grand Valley State University. The new material is morphologically consistent with the previously collected material, but is dated to 1.3 million years ago. The scientists used 3D geometric morphometrics to confirm that the fossil tibia does indeed belong to the Hispaniola monkey, a primate that we now know existed on the island relatively unchanged for over one million years. This process helped them reconstruct how the small primate might have moved about in its environment and allowed the comparison of relatively young examples of Antillothrix bernensis bones to the newly discovered million year old specimen. The presence of endemic new world monkeys on the Caribbean islands is one the great questions of biogeography and our work on these fossils shows Antillothrix bernensis existed on Hispaniola relatively morphologically unchanged for over a million years, said co author Dr Helen Green of the University of Melbourne. By establishing the age of these fossils we have changed the understanding of primate evolution in this region. Many times when a long lived species is discovered, there is a shift in its morphology over time, Dr Tallman added. For these primates, at least in the tibia, they remained remarkably stable morphologically. They obviously adapted to their island environment in such a way that was flexible enough that it allowed them to persist for more than one million years. They were likely still around when humans first colonized the Greater Antillean Islands.

While Eunotosaurus africanus lacks the iconic turtle shell, its wide ribs and distinctively circular torso are the first indications that this ancient animal represents an important clue in a long unsolved mystery the origin of turtles. In a study published in the journal Nature, the scientists focus their attention on the skull of Eunotosaurus africanus. Their findings indicated that the complex anatomy of the head houses convincing evidence of the important role played by this species in the history of turtle evolution. Our previous studies showed that Eunotosaurus africanus possessed structures that likely represent the first steps in the evolution of the turtle shell, but what those studies lacked was a detailed analysis of the skull, said co author Dr Tyler Lyson of the Denver Museum of Science and Nature. Using high resolution computed tomography, the scientists digitally dissected the bones and internal structures of multiple Eunotosaurus skulls, all of which are housed in South African museums. They then incorporated the observations into a new analysis of the reptile tree of life. One of the studys findings is that the skull of Eunotosaurus africanus has a pair of openings set behind the eyes that allowed the jaw muscles to lengthen and flex during chewing. Known as the diapsid condition, this pair of openings is also found in lizards, snakes, crocodilians, and birds. The skull of modern turtles is anapsid without openings, with the chamber housing the jaw muscles fully enclosed by bone. The anapsid diapsid distinction strongly influenced the long held notion that turtles are the remnants of an ancient reptile lineage and not closely related to modern lizards, crocodiles, and birds. The new data reject this hypothesis. If turtles are closely related to the other living reptiles then we would expect the fossil record to produce early turtle relatives with diapsid skulls, said lead author Dr Gaberiel Bever from the New York Institute of Technology.  That expectation remained unfulfilled for a long time, but with some help from technology and a lot of hard work on our part, we can now draw the well supported and satisfying conclusion that Eunotosaurus africanus is the diapsid turtle that earlier studies predicted would be discovered. In linking turtles to their diapsid ancestry, the skull of Eunotosaurus africanus also reveals how the evidence of that ancestry became obscured during later stages of turtle evolution. The skull of Eunotosaurus africanus grows in such a way that its diapsid nature is obvious in juveniles but almost completely obscured in adults, Dr Bever said. If that same growth trajectory was accelerated in subsequent generations, then the original diapsid skull of the turtle ancestor would eventually be replaced by an anapsid skull, which is what we find in modern turtles.

The fossil, which is that of a new genus and species, was found on the Caribbean coast near the town of Pi\u00f1a. It consists of half a skull, lower jaw with an almost entire set of conical teeth, right shoulder blade and two small bones from the flipper. In comparison with other river dolphins, the shape and size of these parts suggest that the specimen may have been more than 9 feet 2.7 m in length. Dr Nicholas Pyenson from the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History and co authors named the new dolphin Isthminia panamensis. Isthm  reflects the type specimens provenance from the Isthmus of Panama and the crucial role that the formation of this isthmus played in Earth history and evolution of the biota of the Americas, Dr Pyenson and his colleagues wrote in a paper published in the journal PeerJ. The feminine generic epithet  inia reflects its similarities to the living Amazon River dolphin. The species epithet,\u00a0panamensis, recognizes the Republic of Panama, its people, and the many generations of scientists who have studied its geological and biological histories. We discovered this new fossil in marine rocks, and many of the features of its skull and jaws point to it having been a marine inhabitant, like modern oceanic dolphins, Dr Pyenson said. Today there are only five species of river dolphins  the South Asian river dolphin Platanista gangetica, Amazon river dolphin Inia geoffrensis, Araguaian river dolphin Inia araguaiaensis, Bolivian river dolphin Inia boliviensis and La Plata dolphin Pontoporia blainvillei  all living in freshwater or coastal ecosystems. Each of the species show a common solution to the problem of adapting away from marine to freshwater habitats by converging upon a body plan that includes broad, paddle like flippers, flexible necks and heads with particularly long, narrow snouts  all the better to navigate and hunt in rivers. But fossil evidence suggests that river dolphins ancestors were widespread around the globe. Isthminia panamensis was clearly one of them, and its fossil remains have helped the paleontologists understand something less clear when in their evolutionary tract did river dolphins transition from the saltwater of the ocean to the freshwater of rivers? Isthminia panamensis is actually the closest relative of the living Amazon river dolphin. While whales and dolphins long ago evolved from terrestrial ancestors to fully marine mammals, river dolphins represent a reverse movement by returning inland to freshwater ecosystems, said senior author Dr Aaron ODea of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama. As such, fossil specimens may tell stories not just of the evolution these aquatic animals, but also of the changing geographies and ecosystems of the past.

The creature, Pentecopterus decorahensis, is the oldest known species of eurypterid sea scorpion  a group of aquatic arthropods that are ancestors of modern spiders, lobsters, and ticks. The discovery published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology was made by paleontologists from Yale University and the University of Iowa. This shows that eurypterids evolved some 10 million years earlier than we thought, and the relationship of the new animal to other eurypterids shows that they must have been very diverse during this early time of their evolution, even though they are very rare in the fossil record, said lead author Dr James Lamsdell of Yale University. Dr Lamsdell and co authors named the ancient monster after the penteconter  an ancient Greek warship that the species resembles in outline and parallels in its predatory behavior. Pentecopterus decorahensis is large and predatory, and eurypterids must have been important predators in early Palaeozoic ecosystems, Dr Lamsdell said. The creature had a long head shield, a narrow body, and large, grasping limbs for trapping prey. Pentecopterus decorahensis is incredibly bizarre. The shape of the paddle  the leg which it would use to swim  is unique, as is the shape of the head. Its also big  over 6 feet 1.5 m long, Dr Lamsdell added. Perhaps most surprising is the fantastic way it is preserved  the exoskeleton is compressed on the rock but can be peeled off and studied under a microscope. This shows an amazing amount of detail, such as the patterns of small hairs on the legs. At times it seems like you are studying the shed skin of a modern animal  an incredibly exciting opportunity for any paleontologist. "}, {"title": " Scientists Find Evidence of Ancient Microbial Life in Sub-Seafloor Mantle Rocks", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Sep 1, 2015", "doc": "Traces of ancient microbial communities have been found in rock samples of Earths mantle from a seafloor hydrothermal system that was active more than 100 million years ago during the Lower Cretaceous  the earlier of the two major divisions of the Cretaceous period  when the supercontinent Pangaea was breaking apart and the Atlantic Ocean was just about to open. This discovery, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, confirms a long standing hypothesis that interactions between mantle rocks and seawater can create potential for life even in hard rocks deep below the ocean floor. We were initially looking at how seawater interacts with mantle rocks, and how that process generates hydrogen, said lead author Dr Frieder Klein of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. But during our analysis of the rock samples, we discovered organic rich inclusions that contained lipids, proteins and amino acids fossilized in the surrounding minerals. This study focused on mantle rocks that were originally exposed to seawater approximately 125 million years ago when a large rift split Pangaea. The rift, which eventually evolved into the Atlantic Ocean, pulled mantle rocks from Earths interior to the seafloor, where they underwent chemical reactions with seawater, transforming the seawater into a hydrothermal fluid. The hydrothermal fluid likely had a high pH and was depleted in carbon and electron acceptors. These extreme chemical conditions can be challenging for microbes, Dr Klein explained. However, the hydrothermal fluid contained hydrogen and methane and seawater contains dissolved carbon and electron acceptors. So when you mix the two in just the right proportions, you can have the ingredients to support life. The rock samples analyzed by Dr Klein and his colleagues were originally drilled from the Iberian continental margin off the coast of Spain and Portugal in 1993. During that expedition scientists drilled through almost 2,300 feet 700 m of mud and sediment deposited onto to the ocean floor to reach the ancient seafloor created during the break up of Pangaea and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The samples had been stored in core repositories at room temperature for more than 20 years, before Dr Kleins team began their investigation and discovered the fossilized microbial remains. Colonies of bacteria and archaea were feeding off the seawater hydrothermal fluid mix and became engulfed in the minerals growing in the fractured rock. This kept them completely isolated from the environment. The minerals proved to be the ultimate storage containers for these organisms, preserving their lipids and proteins for over 100 million years, Dr Klein said. In the lab, samples from the rock interior had to be extracted since the outside of the drill core was stored under non sterile conditions. So the scientists took careful steps to ensure the integrity of the sample interior wasnt compromised, and then analyzed the rocks with microscopes, a confocal Raman spectrometer and a range of isotope techniques. While Raman spectroscopy enabled the team to verify the presence of amino acids, proteins and lipids in the samples, it did not provide enough detailed information to correlate them with other hydrothermal systems. The lipids were of particular interest to the researchers since they tend to be better preserved over long timescales, and have been studied in a wide range of seafloor environments. They ran the lipids through an advanced liquid chromatography based mass spectrometer system to separate out and identify their biochemical components. The analysis led to a remarkable discovery the lipids from the Iberian margin match up with those from the Lost City hydrothermal field, which was discovered in 2000 in the Mid Atlantic Ridge during an expedition on board the WHOI operated research vessel Atlantis. This is significant because scientists believe the Lost City is a present day analog to ancient hydrothermal systems on early Earth. Confirmation that life is possible in mantle rocks deep below the seafloor may have important implications for understanding subseafloor life across a wide range of geologic environments, Dr Klein said. All the ingredients necessary to drive these ecosystems were made entirely from scratch. Similar systems have likely existed throughout most of Earths history to the present day and possibly existed on other water bearing rocky planetary bodies, such as Jupiters moon Europa. The results reinforce the idea that life springs up anywhere there is water, even in seemingly hostile geological environments  a tantalizing prospect as scientists find more and more water elsewhere in the Solar System.

The typical ankylosaur had a wide armored body and a flexible tail. But one group  ankylosaurids  also had a distinctive tail club composed of stiff, interlocking vertebrae the handle and large, bulbous osteoderms the knob  a special kind of bone formed in the skin thats unique to armored dinosaurs. According to a new study published in the Journal of Anatomy, the handle arrived first on the scene, and the knob followed. In this study, Prof Philip Currie from the University of Alberta, Canada, and Dr Victoria Arbour of North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences compared Jurassic ankylosaurs to those from the early and late Cretaceous, tracing the tails evolution from flexible to fearsome. The paleontologists looked at a number of early ankylosaurids including Liaoningosaurus which lived 122 million years ago Gobisaurus, which lived 90 million years ago and Pinacosaurus, which lived 75 million years ago and is the earliest specimen with a complete tail club, to determine which of three possible evolutionary paths was most likely. There are three ways the tail could have evolved, said Dr Arbour, who is the lead author on the study. The knob could have evolved first, in which case youd see ankylosaurids with osteoderms enveloping the end of the tail, but with the tail remaining flexible, she added. The handle could have evolved first, meaning you would see early ankylosaurids with overlapping or fused tail vertebrae. Or the knob and handle could have evolved in tandem, in which case youd see ankylosaurids with both structures, but there could have been other differences like shorter handles or smaller knobs. By comparing the tails of the specimens, the scientists saw that by the early Cretaceous, ankylosaurs had begun to develop stiff tails with fused vertebrae. The knob appeared in the late Cretaceous. While its possible that some of the species could still have developed the handle and knob in tandem, it seems most likely that the tail stiffened prior to the growth of the osteoderm knob, in order to maximize the tails effectiveness as a weapon, Dr Arbour said.

Iguanas are one of the most diverse groups of extant lizards, spanning from acrodontan iguanians those with teeth fused to the top of their jaws dominating the Old World to non acrodontans in the New World, as well as Madagascar and a few Pacific islands. Gueragama sulamericana is the first acrodontan found in South America, suggesting both groups of ancient iguanas roamed throughout Pangaea before its final breakup. The roughly 1,700 species of iguanas are almost without exception restricted to the New World, primarily the southern United States down to the tip of South America, said Dr Michael Caldwell of the University of Alberta, Canada, a co author of a paper published in the journal Nature Communications. And yet, the iguanas closest relatives  including chameleons and bearded dragons all hail from the Old World. According to Dr Caldwell and his colleagues, the Upper Cretaceous Gueragama sulamericana is a missing link in the sense of the paleobiogeography and possibly the origins of the group. Its pretty good evidence to suggest that back in the lower part of the Cretaceous, the southern part of Pangaea was still a kind of single continental chunk, Dr Caldwell said. Distributions of plants and animals from the Upper Cretaceous reflect the ancestry of Pangaea when it was whole. Dr Caldwell explained this Gueragama sulamericana fossil indicates that the group is old, that its probably Southern Pangaean in its origin, and that after the breakup, the acrodontans and chameleon group dominated in the Old World, and the iguanid side arose out of this acrodontan lineage that was left alone in South America. South America remained isolated until about 5 million years ago. Thats when it bumps into North America, and we see this exchange of organisms north and south, he added. It was kind of like a floating Noahs Ark for a very long time, about 100 million years. This is an Old World lizard in the New World at a time when we werent expecting to find it. It answers a few questions about iguanid lizards and their origin.

The recent research findings show that during the last Ice Age, woolly mammoths were the most widely distributed large mammals, thus rightfully serving as a flagship species of the glacial era, said Prof Kahlke, who authored a paper published in the journal Quaternary International. He summarized the mammoths distribution during the most recent Ice Age 110,000  12,000 years ago on a worldwide map, and determined a total distribution area of 33,301,000 sq. km for these extinct giants. From Portugal in the southwest across Central and Eastern Europe, Mongolia, Northern China, South Korea and Japan up to Northeastern Siberia, and thence to the American Midwest and Eastern Canada, from the shelf regions of the Arctic Ocean and Northwestern Europe to the bottom of the Adriatic Sea and to the mountains of Crimea the fossil remains of woolly mammoths have been found everywhere, Prof Kahlke said. We related the computed distribution area to the real land surface at that time, thus generating the most precise map to date regarding the global habitats of the woolly mammoth. Such detailed knowledge regarding the distribution area is not even available for many species of animals alive today. The generated map is based on decades of surveys of thousands of excavation sites on three continents. Even sites under water, off the North American Atlantic shore and the North Sea, were taken into account. Due to the lower sea levels during the Ice Age  a large volume of water was bound in glaciers  these areas had fallen dry and were also inhabited by Mammuthus primigenius, Prof Kahlke said. Only the extinct steppe bison Bison priscus had a widespread distribution similar to that of the woolly mammoth. The bison were clearly more variable than the woolly mammoths, he said. Obviously, the mammoths had a higher tolerance toward various environmental factors and they were able to successfully settle in a variety of rather different open landscapes. But there were certain factors that limited the distribution of Mammuthus primigenius glaciers, mountain chains, semi deserts and deserts, as well as changes in sea level and shifts in vegetation placed restrictions on the species distribution area. The analysis of these limiting factors is useful in understanding the distribution of fossil species and their extinction  as with the mammoths toward the end of the last Ice Age. In addition, the data aid in comprehending current changes in the distribution areas of recent animal species, Prof Kahlke said.

The specimen, according to the team, represents both the earliest baboon ever found and the only non hominin primate yet recovered from Malapa. Modern baboons are typically divided into a number of populations recognized as either species or subspecies spread all throughout sub Saharan Africa and into the Arabian Peninsula. Despite their evolutionary success, modern baboon origins in the fossil record have not well understood or agreed upon. According to molecular clock studies, baboons are estimated to have diverged from their closest relatives by 1.8 to 2.2 million years ago however, until now, most fossil specimens known within this time range have been either too fragmentary to be definitive or too primitive to be confirmed as members of the living species Papio hamadryas, said Dr Gilbert, who is the first author on the study published in the journal PLoS ONE. The new specimen of Papio angusticeps  found during excavations for an early human ancestor known as Australopithecus sediba  helps to confirm the suggestion of previous researchers that Papio angusticeps may, in fact, be an early population of Papio hamadryas. If you placed a number of Papio angusticeps specimens into a modern osteology collection, I dont think youd be able pick them out as any different from those of modern baboons from East and South Africa, Dr Gilbert said. Furthermore, the estimated age of the specimen, 2.026  2.36 million years, is in almost perfect agreement with molecular clock analyses for the initial appearance of modern baboons. Thus, the specimen may help to solve the evolutionary origins of these highly successful animals and confirm the estimates of molecular studies. In addition, because monkeys are widely recognized as key time sensitive elements in the fossil record, the fact that the Malapa Papio angusticeps specimen is well dated allows future studies to better estimate the age of fossil sites where the species is found. South African early hominin sites, in particular, may be able to achieve more accurate age estimates on the basis of these new findings. "}, {"title": " Canids Evolved with Climate Change, Says New Study", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Aug 19, 2015", "doc": "A new study of North American canid fossils published in the journal Nature Communications suggests that the evolutionary path of the family Canidae dogs and relatives can be a direct consequence of climate change. The climate in North Americas heartland back around 40 million years ago was warm and wooded. North American canids of the time, fossils show, were small animals that would have looked more like mongooses than any dogs alive today and were well adapted to that habitat. Their forelimbs were not specialized for running, retaining the flexibility to grapple with whatever meal unwittingly walked by. But beginning just a few million years later, the global climate began cooling considerably and in North America the Rocky Mountains had reached a threshold of growth that made the continental interior much drier. The forests slowly gave way to open grasslands. To find out if this transition affected the evolution of North American canids, Dr Borja Figueirido from the University of Malaga in Spain and co authors examined the fossil elbows and teeth of 32 canid species spanning the period from 40 million years ago to 2 million years ago. At the same time that climate change was opening up the vegetation, canids were evolving from ambushers to pursuit pounce predators like modern coyotes or foxes  and ultimately to those dogged, follow a caribou for a whole day pursuers like wolves in the high latitudes, the scientists said. The elbow is a really good proxy for what carnivores are doing with their forelimbs, which tells their entire locomotion repertoire, added Prof Christine Janis of Brown University, senior author on the study. The telltale change in those elbows has to do with the structure of the base where the humerus articulates with the forearm, changing from one where the front paws could swivel for grabbing and wrestling prey to one with an always downward facing structure specialized for endurance running. Modern cats still rely on ambush rather than the chase cheetahs are the exception and have the forelimbs to match, but canines signed up for lengthier pursuits, Prof Janis said. In addition, the canids teeth trended toward greater durability, consistent with the need to chow down on prey that had been rolled around in the grit of the savannah, rather than a damp, leafy forest floor. The study suggests that predators do not merely evolve as an arms race response to their prey. They dont develop forelimbs for speedy running just because the deer and the antelope run faster. While the herbivores of this time were evolving longer legs, the predator evolution tracked in time directly with the climate related changes to habitat rather than to the anatomy of their prey species. If predators evolved with climate change over the last 40 million years, then they likely will have to continue in response to the human created climate change underway now, the scientists concluded.

The piece of amber containing the fossil is hemispheric in shape, measuring 20 mm in length, 8 mm in greatest width and 8 mm in depth. It came from an amber mine in the northern mountain range of the Dominican Republic, between Puerto Plata and Santiago. I was shocked when I first saw it in amber. There are very few salamander fossils of any type, and no one has ever found a salamander preserved in amber, said Prof George Poinar, Jr., of Oregon State University, lead author of a paper published in the journal Palaeodiversity. And finding it in Dominican amber was especially unexpected, because today no salamanders, even living ones, have ever been found in that region. The salamander, named Palaeoplethodon hispaniolae, belonged to Plethodontidae  a widespread family of salamanders that today is still very common in North America, particularly the Appalachian Mountains. It had back and front legs lacking distinct toes, just almost complete webbing with little bumps on them. As such, it might not have been as prolific a climber as some modern species and it probably lived in small trees or tropical flowering plants, Prof Poinar said. This image shows what Palaeoplethodon hispaniolae might have looked like in real life. Drawing by George Poinar, Jr.  Oregon State University. The discovery of this fossil shows there once were salamanders in the Caribbean, but its still a mystery why they all went extinct. They may have been killed by some climatic event, or were vulnerable to some type of predator. Also a mystery is how salamanders got there to begin with. The physical evidence suggests the fossil represents an early lineage of phethodon salamanders that evolved in tropical America, Prof Poinar said. The lineage of Palaeoplethodon hispaniolae may go back 40 60 million years ago when the Proto Greater Antilles, that now include islands such as Cuba, Jamaica, Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, were still joined to North and South America. Salamanders may have stayed on the islands as they began their tectonic drift across the Caribbean Sea. They also may have crossed a land bridge during periods of low sea level, or its possible a few specimens could have floated in on debris, riding a log across the ocean, Prof Poinar said.

Montsechia vidalii grew 125 to 130 million years ago in the freshwater lakes in what are now mountainous regions of Spain, and was a contemporary of dinosaurs such as the brachiosaurus and iguanodon. The age of the plant is based upon comparisons to other fossils in the same area, notably the freshwater algae charophytes. Fossils of Montsechia vidalii were first discovered more than a century ago in the limestone deposits of the Iberian Range in central Spain. Also previously proposed as one of the earliest flowering plants is Archaefructus sinensis, an aquatic plant found in China. Based on our new analysis, we know now that Montsechia vidalii is contemporaneous, if not more ancient, than Archaefructus sinensis, said Prof David Dilcher of Indiana University, senior author on the study published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The fossils used in the study were poorly understood and even misinterpreted during previous analyses. Prof Donald Les from the University of Connecticut, who was not involved in the study, added the reinterpretation of these fossils provides a fascinating new perspective on a major mystery in plant biology. The conclusions are based upon careful analyses of more than 1,000 fossilized remains of Montsechia vidalii. The precise, painstaking analysis of fossilized structures remains crucial to paleobotany, in contrast to other biological fields, due to the current inability to know the molecular characters of ancient plants from millions of years ago, Prof Dilcher said. This careful examination was important to Montsechia vidalii since most modern observers might not even recognize the fossil as a flowering plant. Montsechia vidalii possesses no obvious flower parts, such as petals or nectar producing structures for attracting insects, and lives out its entire life cycle under water, Prof Dilcher explained. The fruit contains a single seed  the defining characteristic of an angiosperm  which is borne upside down. In terms of appearance, Montsechia vidalii resembles its most modern descendent, identified in the study as Ceratophyllum, Prof Dilcher said. Also known as coontails or hornworts, Ceratophyllum is a dark green aquatic plant whose coarse, tufty leaves make it a popular decoration in modern aquariums and ponds. The team plans to learn more about the species connecting Montsechia vidalii and Ceratophyllum, as well as delve deeper into when precisely other species of angiosperms branched off from their ancient forefathers.

Rangeomorphs were some of the earliest complex organisms on Earth, and have been considered to be some of the first animals  although its difficult for scientists to be entirely sure. They thrived in the oceans during the Ediacaran period, between 580 and 541 million years ago, and could reach up to 6.5 feet 2 m in length, although most were around 4 inches 10 cm. Looking like trees or ferns, they did not appear to have mouths, organs, or means of moving, and probably absorbed nutrients from the water around them. Like many of the life forms during the Ediacaran, rangeomorphs mysteriously disappeared at the start of the Cambrian period, which began about 540 million years ago, so it has been difficult to link rangeomorphs to any modern organisms, or to figure out how they lived, what they ate and how they reproduced. Rangeomorphs dont look like anything else in the fossil record, which is why theyre such a mystery. But weve developed a whole new way of looking at them, which has helped us understand them a lot better  most interestingly, how they reproduced, said Dr Emily Mitchell from the University of Cambridge, UK, who is the lead author of a paper published in the journal Nature. Using statistical techniques to assess the distribution of populations of a rangeomorph called Fractofusus, Dr Mitchell and co authors observed that larger grandparent rangeomorphs were randomly distributed in their environment, and were surrounded by distinct patterns of smaller parents and children. These patterns strongly resemble the biological clustering observed in modern plants, and suggest a dual mode of reproduction the grandparents being the product of ejected waterborne propagules, while the parents and children grew from runners sent out by the older generation, like strawberry plants. Reproduction in this way made rangeomorphs highly successful, since they could both colonize new areas and rapidly spread once they got there, Dr Mitchell said. The capacity of these organisms to switch between two distinct modes of reproduction shows just how sophisticated their underlying biology was, which is remarkable at a point in time when most other forms of life were incredibly simple.

The teeth of theropod dinosaurs are characterized by ziphodonty, the presence of serrations on their cutting edges. The only reptile living today that has the same superficial tooth structure is the Komodo dragon Varanus komodoensis. What is so fascinating to me is that all animal teeth are made from the same building blocks, but the way the blocks fit together to form the structure of the tooth greatly affects how that animal processes food. The hidden complexity of the tooth structure in theropods suggests that they were more efficient at handling prey than previously thought, likely contributing to their success, said Dr Kirstin Brink from the University of Toronto Mississauga, who is the first author on the study. Dr Brink and co authors found that the unique arrangement of tooth tissues did not develop in response to these carnivores chewing hard materials. They determined this by examining samples of dinosaur teeth that had not yet broken through the gums, as well as samples from mature dinosaur teeth. Unlike humans, reptiles grow new teeth throughout their lifetimes. What is startling and amazing about this work is that Dr Brink was able to take teeth with these steak knife like serrations and find a way to make cuts to obtain sections along the cutting edge of these teeth, said co author Prof Robert Reisz, also from the University of Toronto Mississauga. If you dont cut them right, you dont get the information. This brought about a developmental explanation for the tooth formation the serrations are even more spectacular and permanent. The paleontologists used a scanning electron microscope and a synchrotron to do a thorough examination and analysis of tooth slices from eight carnivorous theropods, including Tyrannosaurus rex, Allosaurus, Coelophysis and Gorgosaurus. We present the first model for the development of ziphodont teeth in theropods through histological, SEM, and SR FTIR analyses, revealing that structures previously hypothesized to prevent tooth breakage instead first evolved to shape and maintain the characteristic denticles through the life of the tooth, they wrote in the paper. We show that this novel complex of dental morphology and tissues characterizes Theropoda, with the exception of species with modified feeding behaviors, suggesting that these characters are important for facilitating the hypercarnivorous diet of most theropods. This adaptation may have played an important role in the initial radiation and subsequent success of theropods as terrestrial apex predators.

The snake, named Tetrapodophis amplectus, lived during the Early Cretaceous, around 110 million years ago. At the time, South America was united with Africa as part of a supercontinent known as Gondwana. The presence of the oldest definitive snake fossil on the ancient supercontinent suggests that snakes may originally have evolved there, and only became widespread much more recently. The specimen is a juvenile and very small, measuring just 8 inches 20 cm from head to toe, although it may have grown much larger. It lacks the long, laterally compressed tail typically found in aquatic animals, suggesting that snakes did not evolve from marine ancestors. But the most remarkable thing about this snake is the presence of two sets of legs. The front legs are very small, about 0.4 inches 1 cm long, but have little elbows and wrists and hands that are just five millimeters in length. The back legs are slightly longer and the feet are larger than the hands and could have been used to grasp its prey. It is generally accepted that snakes evolved from lizards at some point in the distant past. What scientists dont know yet is when they evolved, why they evolved, and what type of lizard they evolved from, said Dr Martill, first author of a paper published in the journal Science. This fossil answers some very important questions, for example it now seems clear to us that snakes evolved from burrowing lizards, not from marine lizards. Tetrapodophis amplectus would have lived on the bank of a salt lake, surrounded by succulent plants. The snake would probably have lived on a diet of small amphibians and lizards, trying to avoid the dinosaurs and pterosaurs that lived there. Tetrapodophis amplectus is a perfect little snake, except it has these little arms and legs, and they have these strange long fingers and toes, added co author Dr Nick Longrich from the University of Bath, UK. The hands and feet are very specialized for grasping. So when snakes stopped walking and started slithering, the legs didnt just become useless little vestiges  they started using them for something else. Were not entirely sure what that would be, but they may have been used for grasping prey, or perhaps mates. Interestingly, the snake also has the remains of its last meal in its guts, including some fragments of bone. The prey was probably a salamander, showing that snakes were carnivorous much earlier in evolutionary history than previously believed. The preservation of the little snake is absolutely exquisite. The skeleton is fully articulated. Details of the bones are clearly visible and impressions of soft tissues such as scales and the trachea are preserved, said Germany paleontologist Dr Helmut Tischlinger, co author on the study.

By contrast, extreme cold periods, such as the last glacial maximum, do not appear to correspond with these extinctions. They came to their conclusions after detecting a pattern, a decade ago, in ancient DNA studies suggesting the rapid disappearance of large species. At first they thought these were related to intense cold snaps. However, as more fossil DNA became available from museum specimen collections and through improvements in carbon dating and temperature records that showed better resolution through time, they were surprised to find the opposite. It became increasingly clear that rapid warming, not sudden cold snaps, was the cause of the extinctions during the last glacial maximum. The results, published online in the journal Science, help explain the sudden disappearance of mammoths and giant sloths that became extinct around 11,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age. Its important to recognise that man still played an important role in the disappearance of the major mega fauna species, said study co author Prof Chris Turney from the University of New South Wales. The abrupt warming of the climate caused massive changes to the environment that set the extinction events in motion, but the rise of humans applied the coup de gr\u00e2ce to a population that was already under stress. Even without the presence of humans we saw mass extinctions,\u00a0Prof Cooper added. When you add the modern addition of human pressures and fragmenting of the environment to the rapid changes brought by global warming, it raises serious concerns about the future of our environment. In addition, the new statistical methods used to interrogate the datasets and the new data itself has created an extraordinarily precise record of climate change and species movement over the Pleistocene.

The new dinosaur, named Zhenyuanlong suni, belonged to a family of feathered meat eaters that was widespread during the Cretaceous period. The species is a close cousin of the famous Velociraptor and is the largest dinosaur ever to have a set of bird like wings. The near complete skeleton of Zhenyuanlong suni was studied by paleontologists Dr Steve Brusatte from of the University of Edinburgh, UK, and Prof Junchang L\u00fc from the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences Institute of Geology. Zhenyuanlong suni grew to more than 5 feet 1.5 meters in length. Its wings were very short compared with other dinosaurs in the same family and consisted of multiple layers of large feathers  complex structures made up of fine branches stemming from a central shaft. Although larger feathered dinosaurs have been identified before, none have possessed such complex wings made up of quill pen like feathers, the paleontologists said. Despite having bird like wings, Zhenyuanlong suni probably could not fly, at least not using the same type of powerful muscle driven flight as modern birds. It is unclear what function the short wings served. This new dinosaur is one of the closest cousins of Velociraptor, but it looks just like a bird. Its a dinosaur with huge wings made up of quill pen feathers, just like an eagle or a vulture, said Dr Brusatte, who is a co author of a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports. The movies have it wrong  this is what Velociraptor would have looked like too. Prof L\u00fc added the western part of Liaoning Province in China is one of the most famous places in the world for finding dinosaurs. The first feathered dinosaurs were found here and now our discovery of Zhenyuanlong suni indicates that there is an even higher diversity of feathered dinosaurs than we thought. Its amazing that new feathered dinosaurs are still being found.

The generic name Wendiceratops means Wendys horned face, and celebrates renowned Alberta fossil hunter Wendy Sloboda. This is a well deserved honor for Sloboda, who has discovered hundreds of important fossils in the last three decades, including several new species, said Dr David Evans of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Canada, who is a co author of the study published in the journal PLoS ONE. Wendy Sloboda has a sixth sense for discovering important fossils. She is easily one of the very best dinosaur hunters in the world, he added. Wendiceratops pinhornensis is described from over 200 bones representing the remains of at least four individuals, three adults and one juvenile, collected from the lower part of the Oldman Formation middle Campanian. The dinosaur lived 79 million years ago Cretaceous period, making it one of the oldest known members of Ceratopsidae, a family of large bodied horned dinosaurs that includes the famous Triceratops. It was approximately 20 feet 6 meters long and weighed more than 1,000 kg. It was an herbivore, and would crop low lying plants with a parrot like beak, and slice them up with dozens of leaf shaped teeth. The dinosaur also had a fantastically adorned skull, particularly for an early member of Ceratopsidae. Its most distinctive feature is a series of forward curling hook like horns along the margin of the wide, shield like frill that projects from the back of its skull. Wendiceratops pinhornensis ranks among other recent discoveries in having some of the most spectacular skull ornamentation in the horned dinosaur group. Full size skeleton of Wendiceratops pinhornensis on display at the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada. Photo credit Brian Boyle. Wendiceratops helps us understand the early evolution of skull ornamentation in an iconic group of dinosaurs characterized by their horned faces, Dr Evans said. The discovery of Wendiceratops pinhornensis also adds to a growing body of research which suggests high diversity of ceratopsid dinosaurs likely associated with a rapid evolutionary radiation in the group. The wide frill of Wendiceratops pinhornensis is ringed by numerous curled horns, the nose had a large, upright horn, and its likely there were horns over the eyes too. The number of gnarly frill projections and horns makes it one of the most striking horned dinosaurs ever found, Dr Evans said.

Victoriapithecus first made headlines in 1997 when its fossilized skull was discovered on Maboko Island in Lake Victoria, Kenya, where it lived approximately 15 million years ago. As fossils from this era are rare, Victoriapithecus skull was one of the only clues to the early brain evolution of Old World monkeys. Before it was studied, paleontologists didnt know if primate brains got bigger first and then more complex, or vice versa. Thanks to high resolution X ray imaging, Lauren Gonzales of Duke University and co authors have peered inside Victoriapithecus cranial cavity and created a 3D computer model of what the primates brain likely looked like. Micro CT scans of its skull show that the monkey had a small brain relative to its body. The scientists calculated its brain volume to be about 36 cubic cm, which is less than half the volume of monkeys of the same body size living today. If similar sized monkeys have brains the size of oranges, the brain of this particular male was more akin to a plum. Despite its puny proportions, the monkeys brain was surprisingly complex. In the part of the primate family tree that includes apes and humans, the thinking is that brains got bigger and then they get more folded and complex. But this study is some of the hardest proof that in monkeys, the order of events was reversed  complexity came first and bigger brains came later, said Ms Gonzales, lead author of the paper reporting the results in the journal Nature Communications this week. The CT scans revealed numerous distinctive wrinkles and folds, and the olfactory bulb part of the brain used to perceive and analyze smells was three times larger than expected. Victoriapithecus probably had a better sense of smell than many monkeys and apes living today. In living higher primates you find the opposite the brain is very big, and the olfactory bulb is very small, presumably because as their vision got better their sense of smell got worse. But instead of a tradeoff between smell and sight, Victoriapithecus might have retained both capabilities, Ms Gonzales said. The findings are important because they offer new clues to how primate brains changed over time, and during a period from which there are very few fossils. The results also lend support to claims that the small brain of the human ancestor Homo floresiensis, whose 18,000 year old skull was discovered on a remote Indonesian island in 2003, isnt as remarkable as it might seem. In spite of their pint sized brains, Homo floresiensis was able to make fire and use stone tools to kill and butcher large animals.  Lauren A. Gonzales et al. 2015.

The new dinosaur belongs to a group of feathered dinosaurs known as oviraptors. It has been given the official name Huanansaurus ganzhouensis. The genus name refers to Huanan in Chinese Pinyin, which means southern China, because the dinosaur was discovered in Ganzhou of Jiangxi Province. The species name refers to the locality of Ganzhou. Huanansaurus ganzhouensis fossilized skeleton with a nearly complete skull was discovered and analyzed by paleontologists from Uppsala University in Sweden, Institute of Geology and the Henan Geological Museum in China, Hokkaido University in Japan, and the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources in South Korea. The specimen has a nearly complete skull including lower jaws. Seven cervical vertebrae are preserved the first four are almost complete whereas the last three are only preserved as fragments or impressions, the scientists wrote in the paper published in the journal Scientific Reports. The partial humerus, ulna, radius and complete hand of the right arm, the left hand, a small portion of the distal end of the right femur, the proximal end of the right tibia, and the distal portion of the right pes are preserved. Huanansaurus ganzhouensis was a small two legged dinosaur with a parrot like beak and a crest on top of its skull. But it had a different jaw structure than most oviraptorid dinosaurs. This new dinosaur was a cousin of the Mongolian Citipati and lived in the Upper Cretaceous epoch, about 72 million years ago. The most closely related to Huanansaurus is Citipati, which was found approximately 3,000\u2009km northeast in the Djadokhta Formation at Ankylosaur Flats, Mongolia, the paleontologists wrote in the paper.

The prehistoric creature, named Babibasiliscus alxi, belongs to a lizard family called Corytophanidae also known as casquehead or helmeted lizards. The evolutionary history of this group remains poorly understood, due to the small number of fossils available for study. Modern casquehead lizards live in an area stretching from southern Mexico to northern South America, flourishing in the higher temperatures found at the equator. According to Dr Jack Conrad from NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine and the American Museum of Natural History, author of the study published in the journal PLoS ONE, Babibasilscus alxi may represent the earliest clear member of Corytophanidae. A new fossil corytophanid from the Bridger Formation represents the sister taxon to extant Laemanctus, Dr Conrad wrote in the PLoS ONE paper. Although modern corytophanids are restricted to Central and South America, I posit that the group had a EuramericanLaurasian origin and became restricted to lower latitudes after post Eocene global cooling. Measuring two feet 60 cm long, the lizard was likely active during the day and spent a lot of time in trees. A ridge of bone on the skull gave it an angry look while providing shade for its eyes. Each small tooth had three points suitable for eating snakes, lizards, fish, insects and plants, but with a fairly large cheekbone, Babibasiliscus alxi may have enjoyed larger prey items as well. The lizard may have skimmed the surfaces of lush, watery habitats in Wyoming, which at the time probably had a climate matching todays tropics. Along with Geiseltaliellus from roughly coeval rocks in central Europe, the new find further documents the tropical fauna present during greenhouse conditions in the northern mid latitudes approximately 50 million years ago. Given our current period of global climate fluctuation, looking to the fossil record offers an important opportunity to observe what is possible, and may give us an idea of what to expect from our dynamic Earth, Dr Conrad said.

The saber toothed cat lived in the Americas until going extinct about 10,000 years ago. The cats are famous for their protruding canines, which could grow to be about 7 inches 18 cm long. Although fossils are available to paleontologists, very little is known about the ages at which the animals reached key developmental stages. Timing of development is critical for many aspects of vertebrate ecology and evolution. Changes in the timing of life history events can have major effects on an organisms adult features and final appearance, said study co author Dr Robert Feranec of the New York State Museum. For extinct species, we can usually only determine the relative sequence of developmental events. For predators such as big cats, an important determinant of an individuals full hunting ability is the time required to grow their weapons  their teeth. This is especially crucial for understanding saber toothed predators such as Smilodon, added co author Dr Jack Tseng from the American Museum of Natural History. Using saber toothed cat fossils recovered from Rancho La Brea in Los Angeles, the scientists combined data from stable oxygen isotope analyses, micro computed tomography, and previous studies to establish the eruption rate for the saber toothed cats permanent upper canines and to calculate the timing of other growth events. The scientists estimate that the permanent dentition of saber toothed cats was fully erupted by 14 to 22 months, with the exception of the upper canines. These werent fully developed until about 3 years of age, which is delayed in comparison to similar sized living members of the cat family. The eruption rate of the saber toothed cats permanent upper canines was 6 mm per month, double the growth rate of African lions teeth. The paleontologists suggest that the technique used in the study could be applied to a variety of extinct species to better understand the manner and rate by which different animals grew, for example, by looking at the tusks of extinct elephants or marine mammals. Despite having canine crown heights that were more than twice those of the lion, it didnt require twice as much time to develop its canines, said study first author Dr Aleksander Wysocki of Clemson University.

The specimen, now named Sefapanosaurus zastronensis, was found in the 1930s in the Upper Triassic Lower Jurassic Elliot Formation near the town of Zastron, in the Free State Province of South Africa, about 30 km west of the Lesotho border. A few years ago it was studied and considered to represent the remains of another South African dinosaur, Aardonyx. However, upon further study, close scrutiny of the fossilized bones has revealed that it is a completely new species of dinosaur. Sefapanosaurus zastronensis is among the early members of the group that gave rise to the later long necked giants of the Mesozoic. The medium sized dinosaur is a member of the growing list of transitional sauropodomorph dinosaurs from Argentina and South Africa that are increasingly telling us about how they diversified, said Dr Alejandro Otero of the CONICET in La Plata, Argentina, and the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, lead author on the study published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnaean Society. Sefapanosaurus zastronensis helps to fill the gap between the earliest sauropodomorphs and the gigantic sauropods, he added. According to the team, one of the most distinctive features of Sefapanosaurus zastronensis is that one of its ankle bones, the astragalus, is shaped like a cross. This new animal shines a spotlight on southern Africa and shows us just how much more we have to learn about the ecosystems of the past, even here in our own backyard, said study senior author Dr Jonah Choiniere of the University of the Witwatersrand.

The ancient creature, Collinsium ciliosum Hairy Collins Monster, belongs to a poorly understood group of legged worm like animals called Lobopodia. It had a soft and squishy body, 6 pairs of feather like front legs, and 9 pairs of rear legs ending in claws. Since the rear legs were not well suited for walking along the ocean floor, it is likely that the worm eked out an existence by clinging onto sponges or other hard substances by its back claws, while sieving out its food with the front legs. Given its sedentary lifestyle and soft body, Collinsium ciliosum would have been a sitting duck for any predators, so it developed an impressive defense mechanism as many as 72 sharp and pointy spikes of various sizes covering its body, making it one of the earliest soft bodied animals to develop armor for protection. The fossil specimens of Collinsium ciliosum were found in the Xiaoshiba deposit near Kunming, Yunnan Province, southern China. According to the scientists,\u00a0Collinsium ciliosum is a distant ancestor of modern velvet worms, a small group of squishy animals resembling legged worms that live in tropical forests. Modern velvet worms are all pretty similar in terms of their general body organization and not that exciting in terms of their lifestyle. But during the Cambrian, the distant relatives of velvet worms were stunningly diverse and came in a surprising variety of bizarre shapes and sizes, said Dr Javier Ortega Hern\u00e1ndez from the University of Cambridge, UK, a co author of the paper published today in the journal PNAS. The species resembles Hallucigenia, another otherworldly Cambrian fossil, albeit one which has been the subject of much more study. Animals during the Cambrian were incredibly diverse, with lots of interesting behaviors and modes of living, Dr Ortega Hern\u00e1ndez said. Collinsium ciliosum was one of these evolutionary experiments  one which ultimately failed as they have no living direct ancestors  but its amazing to see how specialized many animals were hundreds of millions of years ago.

According to the team, this extinct creature, named Pappochelys, is a missing link in the evolutionary history of turtles. The mystery of how the turtle got its shell has been a long standing question in evolutionary biology. In the case of Pappochelys, we see that its belly was protected by an array of rod like bones, some of which are already fused to each other, said team member Dr Hans Dieter Sues of the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. Such a stage in the evolution of the turtle shell had long been predicted by embryological research on present day turtles but had never been observed in fossils  until now. Dr Sues and his colleague, Dr Rainer Schoch of the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, studied more than a dozen specimens of Pappochelys that were collected beginning in 2006. Pappochelys was about 8 inches 20 cm in length and lived in a tropical environment along the shores of a lake in what is now southern Germany. The reptile used its small, peg like teeth to feed on insects and worms and had a long tail, possibly to help with swimming. The scientists said that the discovery of this species confirms that the belly portion of the turtle shell, called the plastron, formed through the fusion of rib like structures and parts of the shoulder girdle. The physical traits of Pappochelys make it a clear intermediate between two of the earliest known turtles, Eunotosaurus and Odontochelys. Eunotosaurus, considered the oldest precursor of turtles, dates back to 260 million years ago and lived in present day South Africa. It had many characteristics only found in turtles, including broad ribs and a lack of intercostal muscles, which attach between the rib bones. Eunotosaurus also had a long slender tail. By comparison, Odontochelys lived in present day China 220 million years ago and had a fully developed plastron, a long tail and jaws with small teeth. Pappochelys fits neatly between these two turtle precursors at 240 million years, sharing some characteristics with Eunotosaurus but having only a partially fused plastron. Features in the skull of Pappochelys also provide critical evidence that turtles are most closely related to other modern reptiles, such as lizards and snakes. Previously, paleontologists believed that turtles may have descended from the earliest known reptiles. Dr Sues and Dr Schoch have documented the discovery of Pappochelys in a paper published in the journal Nature.

Arthropods, velvet worms and water bears all belong to a large group of animals known as ecdysozoans. Though Hallucigenia is not the common ancestor of all ecdysozoans, it is a precursor to velvet worms. While we know that the animals in this group are united by the fact that they molt, we havent been able to find many physical characteristics that unite them, said Dr Martin Smith of the University of Cambridge, lead author of the paper reporting the results in the journal Nature. Finding a previously unknown throat arrangement in Hallucigenia helped Dr Smith and his colleague, Dr Jean Bernard Caron, determine that velvet worms originally had the same configuration  but it was eventually lost through evolution. It turns out that the ancestors of molting animals were much more anatomically advanced than we ever could have imagined ring like, plate bearing worms with an armored throat and a mouth surrounded by spines. We previously thought that neither velvet worms nor their ancestors had teeth. But Hallucigenia tells us that actually, velvet worm ancestors had them, and living forms just lost their teeth over time, Dr Caron said. Hallucigenia was 10  50 mm in length and lived 505 million years ago during the Cambrian Explosion, a period of rapid evolution when most major animal groups first appear in the fossil record. At first, the animal threw scientists for a bit of a loop. When it was identified in the 1970s, it was reconstructed both backwards and upside down the spines along its back were originally thought to be legs, its legs were thought to be tentacles along its back, and its head was mistaken for its tail. Right side up and right way round, Hallucigenia still looks pretty strange it had pairs of lengthy spines along its back, seven pairs of legs ending in claws, and three pairs of tentacles along its neck. More significantly, Hallucigenias unearthly appearance has made it difficult to link it to modern animal groups and to find its home in the Tree of Life. A 2014 study by University of Cambridge paleontologists partially solved this problem by studying the structure of Hallucigenias claws, which helped definitively link it to modern velvet worms. In the new study, Drs Smith and Caron used electron microscopy to examine fossils from the collections of the Royal Ontario Museum and the Smithsonian Institution. Prior to our study there was still some uncertainty as to which end of the animal represented the head, and which the tail. A large balloon like orb at one end of the specimen was originally thought to be the head, but we can now demonstrate that this actually wasnt part of the body at all, but a dark stain representing decay fluids or gut contents that oozed out as the animal was flattened during burial, Dr Smith said.  Identifying this end as the tail led the team to revisit the fossils and dig away the sediment that was covering the head the animals died as they were buried in a mudslide, and their floppy head often ended up pointing down into the mud. This let us get the new images of the head. When we put the fossils in the electron microscope, we were initially hoping that we might find eyes, and were astonished when we also found the teeth smiling back at us, Dr Caron said. The new images show an elongated head with a pair of simple eyes, which sat above a mouth with a ring of teeth. In addition, Hallucigenias throat was lined with needle shaped teeth. The ring of teeth that surrounded the animals mouth probably helped to generate suction, flexing in and out, like a valve or a plunger, in order to suck its food into its throat. The scientists speculate that the teeth in the throat worked like a ratchet, keeping food from slipping out of the mouth each time it took another suck at its food. "}, {"title": " Why Early Dinosaurs Were Small and Rare in Tropics", "author": "Natali Anderson", "date": "Jun 16, 2015", "doc": "A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences sheds light on why early dinosaurs were small, rare and species poor in tropical latitudes throughout the Late Triassic Period 235 201 million years ago, a pattern persisting 30 million years after their origin and 10 15 million years after they became abundant at higher latitudes. For more than 30 million years after dinosaurs first appeared, they remained inexplicably rare near the equator, where only a few small bodied carnivorous species present. The age long absence of big plant eaters at low latitudes is one of the great, unanswered questions in paleontology. And now the mystery has a solution. The new findings suggest that the fluctuations, associated with high atmospheric carbon dioxide, may have prevented the establishment of a diverse community of large dinosaurs such as sauropods and their close relatives. These dinosaurs likely require a productive and stable environment to thrive, conditions not present in equatorial North America until the beginning of the Jurassic Period, about 200 million years ago. Our data suggest it was not a fun place. It was a time of climate extremes that went back and forth unpredictably and large, warm blooded dinosaurian herbivores werent able to exist nearer to the equator  there was not enough dependable plant food, explained study co author Dr Randall Irmis of the University of Utah and the Natural History Museum of Utah. Dr Irmis and his colleagues examined rocks and fossils that come from Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico, a site rich with fossils from the Late Triassic Period including the early carnivorous dinosaurs Coelophysis and Tawa hallae. The rocks at Ghost Ranch were deposited by rivers and streams between 205 215 million years ago at a time when this area was much closer to the equator. During the Late Triassic northern New Mexico was at a latitude comparable to the southernmost tip of India today. By focusing so much effort at a single region like Ghost Ranch, weve made one of the largest and most detailed collections of Late Triassic fossil vertebrates in North America. Additionally, our team was able to provide the first detailed paleoenvironmental analysis for rocks that produce early dinosaur fossils, said senior author Dr Alan Turner of Stony Brook University. The paleontologists reconstructed the deep past by analyzing several kinds of data fossils, charcoal left by ancient wildfires, and stable isotopes from organic matter and carbonate nodules that formed in ancient soils. Fossilized bones, pollen grains and fern spores revealed the types of animals and plants living at different times, marked by layers of sediment. Dinosaurs remained rare among the fossils from Ghost Ranch, accounting for less than 15 of vertebrate animal remains. They were outnumbered in diversity, abundance and body size by the reptiles known as Pseudosuchian archosaurs, the lineage that gave rise to crocodiles and alligators. The sparse dinosaurs consisted mostly of small, carnivorous theropods. Big, long necked dinosaurs, or sauropodomorphs  already the dominant plant eaters at higher latitudes  did not exist at the site or any other low latitude site in Triassic Pangaea, as far as the fossil record shows. The team found that wild climate swings during the Late Triassic Period correspond to changes in plant community structure, from a seed fern dominated system to a conifer dominated system, and that individual plant groups repeatedly alternated from rare to common through time. The conditions would have been something similar to the arid western United States today, although there would have been trees and smaller plants near streams and rivers and forests during humid times, said study lead author Dr Jessica Whiteside of the University of Southampton, UK. The fluctuating and harsh climate with widespread wild fires meant that only small two legged carnivorous dinosaurs, such as Coelophysis, could survive.

Dreadnoughtus schrani lived in the temperate forests of what is now the south of South America during Cretaceous, approximately 77 million years ago. More than a hundred bones and a single tooth representing two individuals of Dreadnoughtus schrani were recovered\u00a0in the period 2005 2009 from the Cerro Fortaleza Formation in Santa Cruz Province, Argentina, and later described as a new species of titanosaur by Dr Kenneth Lacovara of Drexel University and his colleagues. To estimate the mass of the prehistoric monster, Dr Lacovaras team used a scaling equation that predicts body mass based on the size of thigh and arm bones. This method produced a range of estimates with the average being a colossal 59.3 tons. Now, Dr Bates and his colleagues have re evaluated this estimate after it became clear that other sauropod dinosaurs, only marginally smaller than the giant, weighed considerably less than 60 tons. The paleontologists used a 3D skeletal modeling technique to examine body mass more directly. This method involves mathematically reconstructing a skin volume around bones of the dinosaur on a computer and then expanding that skin outline to account for muscle, fat and other tissues. They found that the mass of the Dreadnoughtus schrani was more likely to be between 30 and 40 tons, considerably less than originally thought. Our analysis suggests that only the lower estimates produced by previous methods are plausible. Estimates of 60 tons and above do not fit with our current understanding of the mass characteristics of living land animals, said Dr Bates, who is the first author of results published in the journal Biology Letters.

They used a scanning electron microscopy device to observe the structure, composition and location of the soft tissue inside the dinosaur fossil fragments. They then used a focused ion beam to slice into the samples and observe the internal structure of the fossils. The scientists examined part of a theropod dinosaur claw and identified tiny structures that look ovoid and with an inner denser core. These could potentially be red blood cells although the paleontologists caution that further evidence would be needed to confirm that the structures do not have another origin. The hope is that if red blood cells can be found in fossilized dinosaur fragments, this could help scientists to understand when dinosaurs evolved a warm blooded, bird like metabolism. Dr Bertazzo, Dr Maidment and their colleagues also examined the fossils using a transmission electron microscope to detect the fibrous structures. In one dinosaur fossil fragment, they found structures that looked fibrous and had a banded structure similar to the banding that can be seen in modern day collagen fibers. Further evidence would be needed to definitively conclude that the structures found originate from a preservation of collagen. If verified, the identification of collagen like structures could in the future provide a new independent line of evidence to show how various dinosaur groups are related to each other. We still need to do more research to confirm what it is that we are imaging in these dinosaur bone fragments, but the ancient tissue structures we have analyzed have some similarities to red blood cells and collagen fibers. If we can confirm that our initial observations are correct, then this could yield fresh insights into how these creatures once lived and evolved, said Dr Bertazzo, lead author on the study published in the journal Nature Communications. Our study is helping us to see that preserved soft tissue may be more widespread in dinosaur fossils than we originally thought, Dr Maidment added. Although remnants of soft tissues have previously been discovered in rare, exceptionally preserved fossils, what is particularly exciting about our study is that we have discovered structures reminiscent of blood cells and collagen fibers in scrappy, poorly preserved fossils. This suggests that this sort of soft tissue preservation might be widespread in fossils.

Today, reptilian teeth are constructed in such a way that they are used mostly for seizing food  whether plant or animal  and then crushing it. The teeth do not occlude like those of mammals. In essence they cant chew. The teeth of most herbivorous mammals self wear with use to create complex file surfaces for mincing plants. Its just been assumed that dinosaurs didnt do things like mammals, but in some ways, theyre actually more complex, said Prof Gregory Erickson of Florida State University, lead author on the study. Prof Erickson and his colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania, Lehigh University, American Museum of Natural History and the University of Florida, examined the teeth of Triceratops from museum specimens collected around North America. They discovered that the teeth were made of five layers of tissue. In contrast, plant eating horse and bison teeth, once considered the most complex ever to evolve, have four layers of tissue. Crocodiles and other reptiles have just two. Each of those tissues does something. Theyre not just there for looks, Prof Erickson explained. We show how Triceratops and its relatives evolved teeth that wore during feeding to create fullers recessed central regions on cutting blades on the chewing surfaces, the scientists wrote in the paper. This unique morphology served to reduce friction during feeding. It was achieved through the evolution of a complex suite of osseous dental tissues rivaling the complexity of mammalian dentitions. The question that remains is how prevalent complex dental structure was among dinosaurs and other reptiles. The paleontologists intend to explore this further by examining other reptilian dental records and structures.

The shark fossils were recovered in 2013 from the Lower Cretaceous Duck Creek Formation of Tarrant County, north central Texas. They then were analyzed by a team of paleontologists led by Dr Joseph Frederickson from the University of Oklahoma, Norman. These vertebrae represent a single animal of approximately 6.3 m 20 feet 8 inches in minimum total length, making this individual one of the largest documented sharks from the Early Cretaceous of North America, Dr Frederickson and his colleagues wrote in a paper published in the journal PLoS ONE. The scientists hypothesize that these fossils belong to the prehistoric lamniform shark Leptostyrax macrorhiza lived between 145 and 100 million years ago based on their size and co occurrence in two typical localities. However, without associated teeth, this identification cannot be confirmed, they wrote. This specimen has unique morphology undocumented in any other Cretaceous shark from North America, but shares large size with a contemporaneous vertebra from the Kiowa Shale of Kansas.

The prehistoric creature, named Regaliceratops peterhewsi, is a close relative of the familiar Triceratops and belongs to Ceratopsidae, a group of large bodied, plant eating dinosaurs that evolved in the Cretaceous period and were largely restricted to western North America. Ceratopsid dinosaurs are divided into two subgroups chasmosaurines, which include Triceratops and the new species, and centrosaurines. Centrosaurines went extinct several million years before the chasmosaurines, which went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous along with all the other dinosaurs. Characteristically, chasmosaurines have a small nose horn, large horns over their eyes, and shield like frills with simple scalloped edges. Regaliceratops peterhewsi is unexpected because it shows the exact opposite pattern large nose horn, small horns over the eyes, and elaborately decorated frills similar to centrosaurines. This demonstrates that at least one group of chasmosaurines evolved ornamentation similar to centrosaurines following their extinction. This new species is a chasmosaurine, but it has ornamentation more similar to centrosaurines. It also comes from a time period following the extinction of the centrosaurines, said Dr Caleb Brown, lead author on the study published in the journal Current Biology. Taken together, that makes this the first example of evolutionary convergence in horned dinosaurs, meaning that these two groups independently evolved similar features. The nearly intact skull of Regaliceratops peterhewsi was discovered by Calgary resident Peter Hews, a geologist in the petroleum industry, in southeastern Alberta in 2005. The specimen comes from a geographic region of Alberta where we have not found horned dinosaurs before, so from the onset we knew it was important, Dr Brown said. Despite the formal name, Dr Brown and his co author, Dr Donald Henderson, said theyve taken to calling this dinosaur by the nickname Hellboy after the comic book character. Its due to the difficulty collecting the specimen and for the challenging preparation process to remove it from the very hard rock in which it was encased, the scientists said. Upon discovery, it was instantly noticeable that this specimen was something that had never been seen before, especially considering its unlikely location and unique features. The paleontologists said they hope to uncover more specimens of Regaliceratops peterhewsi. Dr Brown added this discovery also suggests that there are likely more horned dinosaurs out there that we just have not found yet, so we will also be looking for other new species.

The ancient creature, named Clevosaurus sectumsemper, was smaller but extremely similar to the tuatara, a living fossil from New Zealand. Like some other members of its genus, which were found throughout the ancient world, Clevosaurus sectumsemper had self sharpening blade like teeth. With each bite the teeth are sharpened as they cut past each other very precisely. As a result, old individuals are left with sharp ridges of bone which they use as a cutting surface, Klein explained. The species name sectumsemper means always cut, and was chosen to reflect this. It is also a nod to the Harry Potter character Severus Snape, who made a spell called sectumsempra perhaps meaning sever forever. The new reptile has a specially adapted dentition that allows it to tackle much larger food than would usually be expected for such a small animal, the smallest of the clevosaurs, added team member Dr David Whiteside from the University of Bristols School of Earth Sciences. The fossils of Clevosaurus sectumsemper were discovered in the Woodleaze Quarry, South Gloucestershire, United Kingdom. In the Late Triassic, the hills of the South West of the UK formed an archipelago that was inhabited by small dinosaurs and relatives of the tuatara. The new species probably lived near the edge of one of the ancient archipelagos islands, in a relatively hostile environment, Klein said. This would explain why nearly all the bones come from one species, and why there is a relatively high occurrence of healed fractures such as one we found in a rib. Possibly the animals were fighting each other due to a limited food source or perhaps they preyed on each other and bones were broken, but some individuals survived and their broken bones healed, she said. The new species is described in a paper published online in the Proceedings of the Geologists Association.

A team of paleontologists led by Dr Ismar de Souza Carvalho of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro examined the skeleton, complete with feathers, unearthed from the Crato Formation, Araripe Basin, in 2011. The fossil represents an as yet unnamed prehistoric genus and species, and belongs to Enantiornithes  a group of early birds with teeth and clawed wings that eventually all went extinct. According to the team, the specimen was a juvenile with a head and body length of 2.4 inches 6 cm, with a 3 inch 7.6 cm long tail, and had long, ribbon like tail feathers unknown in living birds. One interesting thing of this small bird with the size of a hummingbird is the large feathers in the tail, said team member Dr Fernando Novas of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Until now, birds with this tail design were known to have lived only in what is modern day China. There are possible traces of original colors, which were important to the relationships among the members of this species, said Dr Novas, who is a co author of a paper published in the journal Nature Communications. The skeleton is covered by filamentous feathers, including approximately ten preserved secondary remiges anchored on the forearm, the paleontologists wrote in the paper. The base of the rachis central shaft of the feather bears a row of five granulate spots, which we interpret as remnants of an ornamental color pattern. The spots are distributed in a symmetrical paired line along both rectrices and shows comparable morphology, size, contour and color. On this basis, we hypothesize that these spots may reflect the color pattern of the feather and not a taphonomical artefact. The scientists said the specimen is the oldest bird fossil yet from Gondwana, the supercontinent that once encompassed South America, Antarctica, Africa, Australia and India. "}, {"title": " Dinosaurs Were Warm-Blooded, Scientist Suggests", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "May 29, 2015", "doc": "Dinosaurs were endothermic warm blooded like mammals, says paleontologist Dr Michael DEmic of Stony Brook University. In a 2014 study, a team of scientists led by Dr John Grady of the University of New Mexico suggested that non avian dinosaur metabolism was neither endothermic nor ectothermic cold blooded but an intermediate physiology termed mesothermic. Based on his knowledge of how dinosaurs grew, Dr DEmic re analyzed that study, which led him to the strikingly different conclusion that dinosaurs were more like mammals than reptiles in their growth and metabolism. The study that I re analyzed was remarkable for its breadth  the authors compiled an unprecedented dataset on growth and metabolism from studies of hundreds of living animals. Upon re analysis, it was apparent that dinosaurs werent just somewhat like living mammals in their physiology  they fit right within our understanding of what it means to be a warm blooded mammal, Dr DEmic said. He re analyzed the 2014 study from two aspects. First, the study had scaled yearly growth rates to daily ones in order to standardize comparisons. This is problematic, because many animals do not grow continuously throughout the year, generally slowing or pausing growth during colder, drier, or otherwise more stressful seasons, said Dr DEmic, author on the paper published in the journal Science. Therefore, the previous study underestimated dinosaur growth rates by failing to account for their uneven growth. Like most animals, dinosaurs slowed or paused their growth annually, as shown by rings in their bones analogous to tree rings. The growth rates were especially underestimated for larger animals and animals that live in very stressful or seasonal environments  both of which characterize dinosaurs. The second aspect of the re analysis with the original study takes into account that dinosaurs should be statistically analyzed within the same group as living birds, which are also warm blooded, because birds are descendants of Mesozoic dinosaurs. Separating what we commonly think of as dinosaurs from birds in a statistical analysis is generally inappropriate, because birds are dinosaurs  theyre just the dinosaurs that havent gone extinct. Re analyzing the data with birds as dinosaurs lends more support that dinosaurs were warm blooded, not occupants of a special, intermediate metabolic category.

The beaver Microtheriomys brevirhinus lived in what is now John Day Basin, Oregon, about 29 million years ago. The image is an artists rendering of the extinct giant beaver Castoroides sp., by Charles R. Knight, 1904. The newly discovered genera include the early beaver Microtheriomys brevirhinus the dwarf tree squirrel Miosciurus covensis the primitive pocket mouse Bursagnathus aterosseus the birch mouse Plesiosminthus fremdi an early relative of beavers, Allotypomys pictus Proapeomys condoni Apeomys whistleri Neoadjidaumo arctozophus Proheteromys latidens and Trogomys oregonensis. Of these ten new species, four represent completely new genera Allotypomys, Microtheriomys, Proapeomys, and Bursagnathus. This study fills some substantial gaps in our knowledge of past faunas, specifically smaller mammals, said Dr Samuels, who is a co author of the paper published in the Annals of Carnegie Museum. Some of the new species are really interesting in their own right, and will ultimately help improve our understanding of the evolution of beavers and pocket mice. These new rodents were collected through decades of collaborative work throughout the John Day Formation, Oregon. According to the paleontologists, Microtheriomys brevirhinus may be the distant ancestor of living beavers. Apeomys whistleri, Neoadjidaumo arctozophus, and Proapeomys condoni are early relatives of modern day pocket gophers and kangaroo rats. The pocket mouse Bursagnathus aterosseus is a possible ancestor of these abundant desert rodents. Some of the new rodents are closely related to species from the fossil record of Asia, and help document the dispersal of species across the Bering Land Bridge in the Oligocene, the scientists said. Several of the new species, like the beaver Microtheriomys brevirhinus and pocket mouse Bursagnathus aterosseus, will help inform studies of how living rodents have evolved. William W.

We infer that the most recent common ancestor of all snakes was a nocturnal, stealth hunting predator targeting relatively large prey, and most likely would have lived in forested ecosystems in the Southern Hemisphere, said Dr Allison Hsiang of Yale University, lead author on the study. Dr Hsiang and co authors assembled the most comprehensive dataset to date combining genetic and anatomical data from living and fossil snakes. This dataset allowed them to evaluate the early evolutionary history of snakes using cutting edge computational techniques, in order to generate the first analytical reconstruction of the common ancestor of all snakes. The results strongly suggest that snakes originated on land, rather than in the seas, as the oldest snake fossils currently known  Coniophis, Najash, and Dinilysia  are all terrestrial. Our analyses suggest that the most recent common ancestor of all living snakes would have already lost its forelimbs, but would still have had tiny hind limbs, with complete ankles and toes. It would have first evolved on land, instead of in the sea. Both of those insights resolve longstanding debates on the origin of snakes, said study co author Daniel Field, a PhD candidate at Yale University. Unlike modern snakes such as the boa constrictor, the ancestral snake had yet to evolve the ability to manipulate prey items much larger than its head, and could not yet constrict its prey, Dr Hsiang and Daniel Field added. As for whether snakes evolved on the ancient supercontinent Gondwana or Laurasia, the study suggests an intriguing possibility while the most recent common ancestor of living snakes likely originated in the Southern Hemisphere around 100 million years ago, the most recent common ancestor of all animals, living or extinct, that is more closely related to living snakes than to any other group may have inhabited Laurasia about 128.5 million years ago Early Cretaceous period. Snakes were around during the latter portion of the age of dinosaurs, which means that they, too, experienced the catastrophic bolide impact that marked the end of the Mesozoic era, resulting in the complete extinction of non avian dinosaurs, the paleontologists said. However, our results suggest that snakes actually did quite well for themselves in the wake of this extinction event henophidian snakes seem to undergo a major and extensive radiation following the extinction event. Most likely, the ancestors of modern henophidian snakes were able to take advantage of the relatively empty landscape left behind by the dinosaurs. They had free reign to fill up whatever empty niches they could, just as mammals did, after the demise of the formerly ecologically dominant dinosaurs.

Jasinski named the new species Saurornitholestes sullivani  after paleontologist Robert Sullivan who originally found the dinosaurs partial skull in the BistiDe Na Zin Wilderness Area of New Mexico in 1999. When first described, paleontologists believed it was a member of Saurornitholestes langstoni, a species of theropod dinosaurs in the Dromaeosauridae family. But when Jasinski began a comparative analysis of the specimen to other S. langstoni specimens, he found subtle differences. Notably, he observed that the surface of the skull corresponding with the brains olfactory bulb was unusually large. This feature means that Saurornitholestes sullivani had a relatively better sense of smell than other dromaeosaurid dinosaurs, including Velociraptor, Dromaeosaurus, and Bambiraptor. This keen olfaction may have made Saurornitholestes sullivani an intimidating predator as well, Jasinski said. Saurornitholestes sullivani was a relatively small dinosaur, less than 90 cm 3 feet tall and 1.80 m 6 feet in length. However, it would have been agile and fast, perhaps hunting in packs and using its acute sense of smell to track down prey. 75 million years ago, North America was split into two continents separated by an inland sea.\u00a0Saurornitholestes sullivani lived on the western shores in an area called Laramidia with numerous other dinosaurs.

Dr Ortega Hern\u00e1ndez looked at two types of arthropod ancestors from the middle Cambrian Burgess Shale in Canada  a soft bodied trilobite called Helmetia expansa and Odaraia alata, a bizarre creature resembling a submarine. He found that a hard plate, called the anterior sclerite, and eye like features at the front of their bodies were connected through nerve traces originating from the front part of the brain, which corresponds with how vision is controlled in modern arthropods. The new results also allowed new comparisons with anomalocaridids, a group of large swimming predators of the period, and found key similarities between the anterior sclerite and a plate on the top of the anomalocaridid head, suggesting that they had a common origin. Although it is widely agreed that anomalocaridids are early arthropod ancestors, their bodies are actually quite different. Thanks to the preserved brains in these fossils, it is now possible to recognize the anterior sclerite as a bridge between the head of anomalocaridids and that of more familiar jointed arthropods. The anterior sclerite has been lost in modern arthropods, as it most likely fused with other parts of the head during the evolutionary history of the group, said Dr Ortega Hern\u00e1ndez, who authored the paper in the journal Current Biology. What were seeing in these fossils is one of the major transitional steps between soft bodied worm like creatures and arthropods with hard exoskeletons and jointed limbs  this is a period of crucial transformation. The paleontologist observed that bright spots at the front of the bodies of Helmetia expansa and Odaraia alata, which are in fact simple photoreceptors, are embedded into the anterior sclerite. The photoreceptors are connected to the front part of the fossilized brain, very much like the arrangement in modern arthropods. In all likelihood these ancient brains processed information like in todays arthropods, and were crucial for interacting with the environment, detecting food, and escaping from predators. Heads have become more complex over time. But what were seeing here is an answer to the question of how arthropods changed their bodies from soft to hard. It gives us an improved understanding of the origins and complex evolutionary history of this highly successful group, Dr Ortega Hern\u00e1ndez said.

The new bird belongs to Ornithuromorpha, a clade of birds that contains all extinct and extant species but not the Mesozoic Enantiornithes. Until now the earliest record of this group was from the lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation 125\u2009million years ago, the middle phase in the evolution of the Jehol Biota  the most important and diverse fossil avifauna known to paleontologists. The bird, named Archaeornithura meemannae, represents a new genus and species, and its discovery was reported May 5 in the journal Nature. The genus name, Archaeornithura, is derived from Greek Archae and ornithura, meaning ancient ornithuromorph. The species name honors paleontologist Dr Meemann Chang, for her continuous support of the study of the Jehol Biota. Two partial skeletons of Archaeornithura meemannae were recovered from the Huajiying Formation in Sichakou basin, Fengning County, Hebei, northeastern China. The specimens preserve fairly advanced plumage including a well developed alula bastard wing and fan shaped rectrices. Both the alula and a fan shaped tail are aerodynamically important for living birds during slow flight and increases manoeuvrability, the paleontologists wrote in the paper. Bird fossils are extremely rare in the Mesozoic fossil record, and until the wealth of specimens discovered from Early Cretaceous deposits in northeastern China, very little was known about the early evolution of birds. The Jehol Biota encapsulates a unique window into the biology and morphology of the oldest known avifauna. Until now no ornithuromorphs had been described from the Huajiying Formation, which preserves very few fossil birds because diversity is low and geographic area is restricted, the Huajiying Formation is interpreted as the earliest stage in the diversification of the Jehol Biota. However, the discovery of a new species belonging to the specialized clade of waders  the Hongshanornithidae, indicates that ornithuromorphs themselves were already quite specialized at this point in their evolution. This also strongly supports inferences that this clade originated in a semi aquatic environment. The two specimens of Archaeornithura meemannae are housed in the Tianyu Natural History Museum of Shandong and are publicly accessible.

The prehistoric creature, scientifically named Yi qi, represents a new genus and species. It belongs to Scansoriopterygidae, an extinct family of maniraptorans theropod dinosaurs closely related to birds The genus and species names are derived from Mandarin Chinese Yi wing and qi strange, respectively, referring to the bizarre wings of this animal. The intended pronunciation of the name is roughly ee chee. Yi qi had a stubby head, featherless wings like in bats, long fingers and threadlike feather, which is quite different from the feather of any existing bird. Analysis of Yi qis flying ability shows it was capable of flying short distance between trees, or flying from tree tops to the ground, said Dr Xu, who is the lead author of the paper published in the journal Nature. Living in the mid period of Jurassic, Yi qi could be a pioneer in the evolution of flying ability, added Dr Xiaoting, who is the second author on the paper. Yi qi proves that the prehistoric life had various attempts in developing flying ability, many went into the dead ends, though the flying mode of existing birds seems to be the only one survived to date. The most striking feature of the dinosaur is the presence of an anomalous, slightly curved, distally tapered, rod like bone, which is morphologically unlike any normal theropod skeletal element. Indeed, no equivalent of the rod like bone is known in any other dinosaur even outside Theropoda, but similar structures are present in a diverse array of extant and extinct flying or gliding tetrapods like bats. A partial skeleton of Yi qi was recovered from the Tiaojishan Formation of Hebei Province, China The specimen was collected by a local farmer, but its provenance and authenticity have been confirmed by multiple lines of evidence including sedimentology, taphonomy and computed tomography data, the scientists wrote.

The new dinosaur, named Chilesaurus diegosuarezi, belongs to Tetanurae, a taxonomically and ecologically diverse group of theropod dinosaurs. The genus name, Chilesaurus, honors the country in which the ancient species was discovered. The species name, diegosuarezi, honors Diego Su\u00e1rez, the 7 y old boy who discovered the type specimen at the Toqui Formation in Ays\u00e9n, south of Chilean Patagonia. Since Diegos find, more than ten specimens have been excavated, including four complete skeletons. Chilesaurus diegosuarezi is the first complete dinosaur from the Jurassic Period found in Chile and represents one of the most complete and anatomically correct documented theropod dinosaurs from the southern hemisphere, said Dr Novas, lead author on the study published in the journal Nature. Although plant eating theropods have been recorded in North America and Asia, this is the first time a theropod with this characteristic has been found in a southern landmass. Dr Novas and co authors are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a platypus dinosaur because of its enigmatic combination of characters that include a proportionally small skull and feet more akin to primitive long necked dinosaurs. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but the new dinosaur shows that an herbivorous diet was acquired much earlier than thought. Chilesaurus diegosuarezi can be considered a platypus dinosaur because different parts of its body resemble those of other dinosaur groups due to mosaic convergent evolution. In this process, a region or regions of an organism resemble others of unrelated species because of a similar mode of life and evolutionary pressures, said co author Dr Mart\u00edn Ezcurra of the University of Birmingham, UK. Chilesaurus diegosuarezi shows how much data is still completely unknown about the early diversification of major dinosaur groups. According to the team, the dinosaur represents one of the most extreme cases of mosaic convergent evolution recorded in the history of life.

Stegosaurus is a genus of armored, herbivorous dinosaurs. They lived in what is now the western United States during the Late Jurassic, approximately 150 million years ago. They were 6  9 meters 20  30 feet long, had two staggered rows of bony plates along their back and two pairs of spikes at the end of their tail. The skull and brain were very small for such a large dinosaur. Some individuals had wide plates, some had tall, with the wide plates being up to 45  larger overall than the tall plates. According to the study by Saitta, M.Sc. student at the University of Bristols School of Earth Sciences, tall  and wide plated stegosaurs were not two distinct species, nor were they individuals of different age  they were actually males and females. Saitta examined five specimens of Stegosaurus mjosi with varied plates, excavated from a new quarry in Montana JRDI 5ES Quarry, in addition to previously excavated individuals of this species. CT scanning and microscope analysis of the stegosaur plates showed that the differences were not a result of growth, as the bone tissues had ceased growing in both varieties. As males typically invest more in their ornamentation, the larger, wide plates likely came from males. These broad plates would have provided a great display surface to attract mates, said Saitta, who is the author of the paper published in the journal PLoS ONE. The tall plates might have functioned as prickly predator deterrents in females. Stegosaurs may not have been the only dinosaur to exhibit sexual dimorphism. Other species showed huge crests or nose horns, which were potentially sexual features. Not only does the new study show that dinosaurs exhibited sexual dimorphism, it suggests that the ornamentation of at least some species was used for sexual display.

Osedax worms, also known as boneworms, zombie worms, or bone eating worms, were first discovered on a whale carcass in 2002. There are more than 10 species that can be found in oceans across the globe at depths of up to 4 km. They belong to the worm family Siboglinidae beard worms. Like all species in the family, they have no mouth, anus, or gut. Typically, bone eating worms grow up to 3 4 cm long. They consume whale bones, prompting many marine biologists to believe that they co evolved 45 million years ago, branching out from their cousins that used chemosynthesis to obtain food. But Dr Nicholas Higgs of Plymouth University, UK, and Dr Silvia Danise of the University of Georgia and Plymouth University, found that Osedax worms originated at least 100 million years ago, and subsisted on the bones of prehistoric reptiles such as plesiosaurs and sea turtles. The scientists studied fossil fragments taken from a plesiosaur unearthed in Cambridge, and a sea turtle found in Burham, UK. Using a computed tomography scanner, they were able to create a computer model of the bones, and found bore holes and cavities consistent with the burrowing technique of Osedax. The unusual adaptations and striking beauty of Osedax worms encapsulate the alien nature of deep sea life in public imagination, Dr Higgs said. And our discovery shows that these bone eating worms did not co evolve with whales, but that they also devoured the skeletons of large marine reptiles that dominated oceans in the age of the dinosaurs. Osedax, therefore, prevented many skeletons from becoming fossilized, which might hamper our knowledge of these extinct leviathans.

Sometimes referred to as the T. rex of the sea, mosasaurs were a group of predatory marine reptiles that inhabited all of the worlds oceans during the Late Cretaceous epoch, between 90 million and 66 million years ago. They went extinct during the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event 66 million years ago which killed all of the dinosaurs. The largest known mosasaur is Hainosaurus bernardi, which could reach 17 metres in length. Although their relationship to other reptiles is not completely certain, mosasaurs appear to be closely related to a group known as monitor lizards. Despite an extensive fossil record, surprisingly little is known about aspects of the breeding and birth of mosasaurs. Dr Behlke and his colleagues have gained new insights from young mosasaur specimens at the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History collected over a century ago that had previously been thought to belong to ancient marine birds. Their study, published in the journal Palaeontology, answers long held questions about the initial environment of mosasaurs. The paleontologists concluded that the Yale specimens  the youngest mosasaur specimens ever found  showed a variety of jaw and teeth features that are only found in mosasaurs. Also, the fossils Clidastes sp. were found in deposits in the open ocean. Really, the only bird like feature of the specimens is their small size, said co author Dr Aaron LeBlanc of the University of Toronto Mississauga. Coming across these tiny mosasaur specimens was really serendipitous, added study lead author Daniel Field of Yale University and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Its not every day that youre able to shed new light on the biology of animals that went extinct 66 million years ago.

Phorusrhacidae the so called terror birds were a group of extinct terrestrial carnivorous birds that are known mainly from the Cenozoic of South America, but also from the Plio Pleistocene of North America and the Eocene of Africa. These birds had a very large body mass, up to 70 kg, and were 0.9  2 meters in height. They were the predominant predators during the Cenozoic and certainly one of the most striking groups that lived during that period. The new species, named the Scaglias Magnificent Bird, is the most complete terror bird ever discovered, with almost 100 percent of the skeleton exquisitely preserved. The scientific name of the bird is Llallawavis scagliai. Llallawa means magnificent in the Quechua language in reference to the nature of the terror birds remains, and avis means bird. The species name honors Galileo Juan Scaglia 19151989, naturalist and director of the Museo Municipal de Ciencias Naturales Lorenzo Scaglia in Buenos Aires, Argentina, during 19401980. Llallawavis scagliai is a medium sized terror bird with an estimated body mass of 18 kg and estimated height of 1.2 m According to the paleontologists, the specimen reveals details of anatomy that rarely preserve in the fossil record, including the auditory region of the skull, voice box, complete trachea, bones for focussing the eye, and the complete palate, allowing an unprecedented understanding of the sensory capabilities of terror birds. The mean hearing estimated for this terror bird was below the average for living birds. This seems to indicate that\u00a0Llallawavis scagliai may have had a narrow, low vocalization frequency range, presumably used for intraspecific acoustic communication or prey detection, said Dr Federico Degrange of the Universidad Nacional de C\u00f3rdoba, CONICET and the Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias de la Tierra, Argentina, who is the lead author of the paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Find Evidence of Cannibalism in Tyrannosaurine Dinosaurs", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 9, 2015", "doc": "The evidence comes from paleontologists Dr David Hone of Queen Mary University of London and Dr Darren Tanke of the Royal Tyrrell Museum who analyzed a fossilized skull and a mandible of the tyrannosaurine dinosaur Daspletosaurus. Daspletosaurus was a large tyrannosaurine dinosaur that lived in what is now North America during the Late Cretaceous period, between 77 and 74 million years ago. Its one of the largest tyrannosaurs, and is closely related to the much larger and more recent Tyrannosaurus rex. Like other tyrannosaurine dinosaurs, Daspletosaurus was most likely both an active predator and scavenger. The individual of Daspletosaurus in question was excavated from the lower part of the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta, Canada. It was a sub adult in dinosaur terms  just under 6 m long and around 500 kg. Dr Hone and Dr Tanke found numerous injuries on its skull that occurred during life, at least some of which were likely inflicted by another Daspletosaurus. It was also bitten after death in an apparent event of scavenging by another tyrannosaur. Although not all of them can be attributed to bites, several are close in size and shape to the teeth of tyrannosaurs. In particular one bite to the back of the head had broken off part of the skull and left a circular tooth shaped puncture though the bone, the scientists said. The fact that alterations to the bones surface indicate healing means that these injuries were not fatal and the animal lived for some time after they were inflicted. This animal clearly had a tough life suffering numerous injuries across the head including some that must have been quite nasty. The most likely candidate to have done this is another member of the same species, suggesting some serious fights between these animals during their lives, said Dr Hone, who is the first author of the paper published in the journal PeerJ. There is no evidence that this Daspletosaurus died at the hands, or mouth, of another tyrannosaur. However, the preservation of the skull and other bones, and damage to the jaw bones show that after the specimen began to decay, a large tyrannosaur possibly Daspletosaurus bit into the animal and presumably ate at least part of it. Combat between large carnivorous dinosaurs is already known and there is already evidence for cannibalism in various groups, including tyrannosaurs. This is however an apparently unique record with evidence of both pre  and post mortem injuries to a single individual.

Now, a new study, led by Dr Emanuel Tschopp of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, the Museu da Lourinh\u00e3, Portugal, and the Universita di Torino, Italy, provides evidence that Brontosaurus is distinct from Apatosaurus and as such can now be reinstated as its own unique genus. Illustration of Brontosaurus in the water, and Diplodocus on land, by Charles R. Knight, 1897. Brontosaurus is one of the most charismatic dinosaurs of all time, inspiring generations of children thanks to its size and evocative name. However, as every paleontologist knows, Brontosaurus was in fact a misnomer, and it should be correctly referred to as Apatosaurus. At least, this is what paleontologists have believed since 1903, when it was decided that the differences between Brontosaurus excelsus and Apatosaurus were so minor that it was better to put them both in the same genus. Because Apatosaurus was named first, it was the one that was used under the rules of scientific naming. In fact, of course, the Brontosaurus was never really gone  it was simply treated as a species of the genus Apatosaurus  A. excelsus. So, while scientists thought the genus Brontosaurus was the same as Apatosaurus, they always agreed that the species excelsus was different from other Apatosaurus species. Now, Dr Tschopp and his colleagues have shown that Brontosaurus was a unique genus all along. Our research would not have been possible at this level of detail 15 or more years ago. In fact, until very recently, the claim that Brontosaurus was the same as Apatosaurus was completely reasonable, based on the knowledge we had, said Dr Tschopp, who is the first author of the paper published in the journal PeerJ. It is only with numerous new findings of dinosaurs similar to Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus in recent years that it has become possible to undertake a detailed reinvestigation of how different they actually were. The differences we found between Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus were at least as numerous as the ones between other closely related genera, and much more than what you normally find between species, said co author Dr Roger Benson of the University of Oxford, UK. Therefore, the scientists have concluded that its now possible to resurrect Brontosaurus as a genus distinct from Apatosaurus. Its the classic example of how science works. Especially when hypotheses are based on fragmentary fossils, it is possible for new finds to overthrow years of research, said study co author Prof Oct\u00e1vio Mateus of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa and the Museu da Lourinh\u00e3. "}, {"title": " Toxic Panthalassa May Have Triggered end-Triassic Mass Extinction, Scientists Say", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 3, 2015", "doc": "A mass extinction some 201 million years ago may have been triggered by changes in the biochemical balance of Panthalassa also known as the Panthalassic Ocean  the larger of the two oceans surrounding the supercontinent of Pangaea, according to a team of scientists led by Prof Jessica Whiteside from the University of Southampton, UK. Prof Whiteside and her colleagues from the United States, Australia, and Canada, have found strong evidence for a condition called marine photic zone euxinia PZE as a globally important extinction mechanism for the end Triassic extinction, also called Triassic Jurassic extinction 201.3 million years ago. PZE occurs when the sun lit surface waters of the ocean become devoid of oxygen and are poisoned by hydrogen sulfide  a by product of microorganisms that live without oxygen that is extremely toxic to most other life forms. Several previous studies have reported evidence of PZE from terrestrial and shallow environments during the latest Triassic, but the new study, published online in the journal Geology, is the first to provide such evidence from an open ocean setting, indicating these changes may have occurred on a global scale. Prof Whitesides team studied fossilized organic molecules extracted from sedimentary rocks that originally accumulated on the bottom of the north eastern Panthalassa, but are now exposed on the Queen Charlotte Islands, Canada. The scientists found molecules derived from photosynthesizing brown pigmented green sulfur bacteria  microorganisms that only exist under severely anoxic conditions  proving severe oxygen depletion and hydrogen sulfide poisoning of the upper ocean at the end of Triassic. They also documented marked changes in the nitrogen composition of organic matter, indicating that disruptions in marine nutrient cycles coincided with the development of low oxygen conditions. As tectonic plates shifted to break up Pangaea, huge volcanic rifts would have spewed carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures from the greenhouse effect, Prof Whiteside explained. The rapid rises in carbon dioxide would have triggered changes in ocean circulation, acidification and deoxygenation. These changes have the potential to disrupt nutrient cycles and alter food chains essential for the survival of marine ecosystems, she added. Our data now provide direct evidence that anoxic, and ultimately euxinic, conditions severely affected food chains. The same carbon dioxide rise that led to the oxygen depleted oceans also led to a mass extinction on land, and ultimately to the ecological take over by dinosaurs, although the mechanisms are still under study, Prof Whiteside said.

Cone snails  which include three small genera, Profundiconus, Californiconus, and Conasprella, and one large genus, Conus  are one of the most well studied groups of marine animals, and are represented by over 700 extant species. The diverse shell coloration patterns of these snails, which all belong to the venomous neogastropod family Conidae, have caused them to be coveted by shell collectors for centuries, and these patterns have even been the subjects of studies by computer modelers. Unlike their modern relatives, fossil cone shells often appear white and without a pattern when viewed in regular visible light. By placing these shells under UV light, the organic matter remaining in the shells fluoresces, revealing the original coloration patterns of the once living animals. However, it remains unclear which compounds in the shell matrix are emitting light when exposed to UV rays. Using this technique, Dr Hendricks of the San Jose State Universitys Department of Geology was able to view and document the shell coloration patterns of 28 different cone snail species that lived between 6.6 and 4.8 million years ago, 13 of which had not been previously described. Determining the coloration patterns of the ancient shells may be important for understanding their relationships to modern species. The scientist compared the preserved patterns with those of modern Caribbean cone snail shells and found that many of the fossils showed similar patterns, indicating that some modern species belong to lineages that survived in the Caribbean for millions of years. A striking exception in this study was the newly described species Conus carlottae, which has a shell covered by large polka dots, a pattern that is apparently extinct among modern cone snails, said Dr Hendricks, who is the author of the paper published in the journal PLoS ONE.

Fossils of fragile female scale insects are extremely rare. What is unique here is the age of the discovery 100 million year old evidence of brood care among insects has not been found until now, said team leader Dr Bo Wang of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is also the lead author of a paper published in the journal eLife. The fossil, named Wathondara kotejai, is from Kachin Province in northern Myanmar. It is the only Mesozoic 252 to 66 million years ago record of an adult female scale insect. The generic name refers to Wathondara  goddess of earth in Buddhist mythology from Southeast Asia, Dr Wang and co authors wrote in the paper. The species is named after the late Polish entomologist Jan Koteja in recognition of his significant contribution to the study of both extant and fossil scale insects. The 100 million year old piece of amber preserves an adult female with eggs, six first instar nymphs, and a weevil. It is polished in the form of a flattened ellipsoid cabochon, clear and transparent, with diameter about 11 mm, height about 5 mm, and weight about 0.8 g. Wathondara kotejai was trapped while carrying around 60 eggs and her first freshly hatched nymphs. The eggs and nymphs are encased in a wax coated egg sac on the abdomen. This primitive form of brood care protects young nymphs from wet and dry conditions and from natural enemies until they have acquired their own thin covering of wax. The behavior has been so successful for promoting the survival of offspring that it is still common in insects today. Young nymphs hatch inside the egg sac and remain there for a few days before emerging into the outside world. The findings may even offer an explanation for the early diversification of scale insects. Brood care could have been an important driver for the early radiation of scale insects, which occurred during the end of the Jurassic or earliest Cretaceous period during the Mesozoic era, Dr Wang said. The only other direct evidence of brood care is from Cenozoic ambers, the era that extends to the present and began about 65 million years ago with the extinction of the dinosaurs.

The newly discovered marine creature, named Yawunik kootenayi, lived during the middle Cambrian, approximately 508 million years ago. The species name, kootenayi, honors the Ktunaxa People, who have long inhabited the Kootenay area where the Marble Canyon locality was found. The genus name comes from Yawunik, a mythological figure described as a huge and fierce marine creature, killing and causing such mayhem that it triggered an epic hunt by other animals to bring the threat down. We wanted to acknowledge the Ktunaxa culture, and given the profile of Yawunik, it looked like a natural choice of name, said team member Cedric Aria, a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto. Yawunik is a central figure in the Ktunaxa creation story, and, as such, is a vital part of Ktunaxa oral history. I am ecstatic that the research team recognizes how important our history is in our territory, and chose to honor the Ktunaxa through this amazing discovery, added Donald Sam, Ktunaxa Nation Council Director of Traditional Knowledge and Language, who was not involved in the study. Yawunik kootenayi is expanding our perspective on the anatomy and predatory habits of the first arthropods, the group to which spiders and lobsters belong, Aria said. It has the signature features of an arthropod with its external skeleton, segmented body and jointed appendages, but lacks certain advanced traits present in groups that survived until the present day. We say that it belongs to the stem of arthropods. Yawunik kootenayi had evolved long frontal appendages that resemble the antennae of modern beetles or shrimps, though these appendages were composed of three long claws, two of which bore opposing rows of teeth that helped the animal catch its prey. The animal was capable of moving its frontal appendages backward and forward, spreading them out during an attack and then retracting them under its body when swimming. Coupled with the long, sensing whip like flagella extending from the tip of the claws, this makes the frontal appendages some of the most versatile and complex in all known arthropods. Unlike insects or crustaceans, Yawunik kootenayi did not possess additional appendages in the head that were specifically modified to process food, said Aria, who is the first author of the paper published online in the journal Palaeontology. Evolution resulted here in a combination of adaptations onto the frontal most appendage of this creature, maybe because such modifications were easier to acquire. We know that the larvae of certain crustaceans can use their antennae to both swim and gather food. But a large active predator such as a mantis shrimp has its sensory and grasping functions split up between appendages. Yawunik kootenayi and its relatives tell us about the condition existing before such a division of tasks among parts of the organism took place. Yawunik kootenayi is the most abundant of the large new species of the Marble Canyon site, and so, as a predator, it held a key position in the food network and had an important impact on this past ecosystem, said Dr Jean Bernard Caron of the University of Toronto. This animal is therefore important for the study of Marble Canyon, and shows how the site increases the significance of the Burgess Shale in understanding the dawn of animals.

The newly discovered species, named Metoposaurus algarvensis, belongs to an extinct genus of primitive amphibians known from the Triassic of Germany, Italy, Poland, and Portugal. These primitive salamander like creatures lived at the same time as the first dinosaurs began their dominance, which lasted for over 150 million years, and formed part of the ancestral stock from which modern amphibians  such as frogs and newts  evolved. Metoposaurus algarvensis was up to 2 meters 6.5 feet long. It lived much like crocodiles do today and fed mainly on fish. This new amphibian looks like something out of a bad monster movie. It was as long as a small car and had hundreds of sharp teeth in its big flat head, which kind of looks like a toilet seat when the jaws snap shut, said Dr Brusatte, the first author of a paper appearing in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. It was the type of fierce predator that the very first dinosaurs had to put up with if they strayed too close to the water, long before the glory days of Tyrannosaurus rex and Brachiosaurus. Most modern amphibians are pretty tiny and harmless. But back in the Triassic these giant predators would have made lakes and rivers pretty scary places to be, added Dr Richard Butler of the University of Birmingham, UK. Several specimens of Metoposaurus algarvensis were collected from a Late Triassic bonebed in Algarve, southern Portugal. They were found in a large bed of bones where up to several hundred of the creatures may have died when the lake they inhabited dried up. Only a fraction of the site  around 4 sq. meters  has been excavated so far, and Dr Brusatte and his colleagues are continuing work there in the hope of unearthing new fossils. According to the paleontologists, the genus Metoposaurus is currently represented by three European species M. diagnosticus, M. krasiejowensis, and the newly discovered M. algarvensis.

Fitting South American ungulates to the mammalian family tree has always been a major challenge for paleontologists, because anatomically they were these weird mosaics, explained Dr MacPhee, the senior author on the study, published in the journal Nature. The scientists analyzed fragments of collagen  a structural protein found in all animal bones  recovered from 48 fossils of South American ungulate mammals Toxodon platensis and Macrauchenia patachonica. They were able to conclusively show that the closest living relatives of these species were the Perissodactyla odd toed ungulates, a group that includes horses, rhinos, and tapirs. By selecting only the very best preserved bone specimens and with various improvements in proteomic analysis, we were able to obtain roughly 90 percent of the collagen sequence for both species. This opens the way for various other applications in paleontology and paleoanthropology, which we are currently exploring, said study lead author Frido Welker of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and the University of York. The results support the idea that the ancestors of Toxodon platensis and Macrauchenia patachonica came from North America more than 60 million years ago, probably just after the mass extinction that killed off non avian dinosaurs and many other vertebrates. Because the South American ungulates were such a large and varied group, it is not clear whether other lineages not studied by the team all had the same origin. People have been successful in retrieving collagen sequences from specimens dating up to 4 million years old, and this is just the start. On theoretical grounds, with material recovered from permafrost conditions, we might be able to reach back 10 million years, said co author Prof Matthew Collins of the University of York, UK.

The newly discovered creature, named Carnufex carolinensis, or the Carolina Butcher, is one of the worlds earliest and largest crocodylomorphs Crocodylomorpha, a group of creatures that includes modern and extinct crocodile relatives. It was about 9 feet 2.7 m long, walked on its hind legs, and likely preyed upon smaller inhabitants of North Carolina ecosystems such as armored reptiles and early mammal relatives. The fossilized skull, spine and upper forelimb of Carnufex carolinensis were collected from the Upper Triassic Pekin Formation in Chatham County, North Carolina. Fossils from this time period are extremely important to scientists because they record the earliest appearance of crocodylomorphs and theropod dinosaurs, two groups that first evolved in the Triassic period, yet managed to survive to the present day in the form of crocodiles and birds, said Dr Zanno, who is the first author of a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports. Dr Zanno and her colleagues suggest that Carnufex carolinensis may have filled one of North Americas top predator roles before dinosaurs arrived on the ancient supercontinent Pangea. Typical predators roaming Pangea included large bodied rauisuchids and poposauroids, fearsome cousins of ancient crocodiles that went extinct in the Triassic Period. In the Southern Hemisphere, these animals hunted alongside the earliest theropod dinosaurs, creating a predator pile up, Dr Zanno said. However, the discovery of Carnufex carolinensis indicates that in the north, large bodied crocodylomorphs, not dinosaurs, were adding to the diversity of top predator niches. Susan Drymala of North Carolina State University and the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, a co author of the discovery paper, added as theropod dinosaurs started to make it big, the ancestors of modern crocs initially took on a role similar to foxes or jackals, with small, sleek bodies and long limbs. If you want to picture these animals, just think of a modern day fox, but with alligator skin instead of fur.

Now a team of paleontologists from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX, the University of Potsdam in Germany, and the National Museums of Kenya, has tapped a fossil from the worlds most precisely dated beaked whale to pinpoint for the first time a date when East Africas mysterious elevation began. The fossil of the beaked whale family Ziphiidae, dating from 17 million years ago, was found about 740 km inland at an elevation of 620 m at Loperot in West Turkana, Kenya. At the time the whale was alive, it would have been swimming far inland up a river with a low gradient ranging from 24 to 37 m over more than 600 900 km. The whale was stranded up river at a time when east Africa was at sea level and was covered with forest and jungle, said Prof Louis Jacobs of Southern Methodist University, a co author of the paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. As that part of the continent rose up, that caused the climate to become drier and drier. So over millions of years, forest gave way to grasslands. Primates evolved to adapt to grasslands and dry country. And thats when  in human evolution  the primates started to walk upright. The Turkana whale would have lived in the open ocean, like its modern beaked cousins. In contrast to most whale fossils, which have been discovered in marine rocks, it was found in river deposits, known as fluvial sediments. The ancient large Anza River flowed in a southeastward direction to the Indian Ocean. The whale, probably disoriented, swam into the river and could not change its course, continuing well inland. The specimen is approximately 17 million years old and represents the oldest derived beaked whale known, consistent with molecular estimates of the emergence of modern straptoothed whales Mesoplodon, the scientists wrote in the PNAS paper. The whale traveled from the Indian Ocean inland along an eastward directed drainage system controlled by the Cretaceous Anza Graben and was stranded slightly above sea level. Surface uplift from near sea level coincides with paleoclimatic change from a humid environment to highly variable and much drier conditions, which altered biotic communities and drove evolution in east Africa, including that of primates. You dont usually find whales so far inland. Many of the known beaked whale fossils are dredged by fishermen from the bottom of the sea, Prof Jacobs said. Determining ancient land elevation is very difficult, but the whale provides one near sea level.

The newly discovered animal, named Aegirocassis benmoulae in honor of the Moroccan fossil hunter Mohamed Ben Moula who discovered the fossils, belongs to the extinct family Anomalocarididae or anomalocaridids, which first appeared 520 million years ago. This marine monster attained a size of at least 7 feet 2 m, ranking it among the biggest arthropods that ever lived. This would have been one of the largest animals alive at the time, said Dr Allison Daley of Oxford University, who is a co author of the paper published in the journal Nature. Aegirocassis benmoulae is a truly remarkable looking creature, added co author Dr Derek Briggs of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Yale Universitys Department of Geology and Geophysics. While most anomalocaridids were apex predators, similar to present day sharks that hunt other animals for food, Aegirocassis benmoulae is more like present day whales, which filter seawater to find their food. These animals are filling an ecological role that hadnt previously been filled by any other animal, Dr Daley said. While filter feeding is probably one of the oldest ways for animals to find food, previous filter feeders were smaller, and usually attached to the sea floor. We have found the oldest example of gigantism in a freely swimming filter feeder. Lead author Dr Peter Van Roy of Yale University added giant filter feeding sharks and whales arose at the time of a major plankton radiation, and Aegirocassis benmoulae represents a much, much older example of this trend. Dr Van Roy excavated an exceptionally well preserved 3D fossil of the new species. Most previous anomalocaridid fossils were flat, like a dried leaf pressed within the pages of a book. Without these 3D remains, we may never have got the insight into these animals anatomy that we did, Dr Daley said. Aegirocassis benmoulae had two pairs of swim flaps per body segment, rather than the one pair found in previous anomalocaridid fossils. The paleontologists show that the two pairs of swim flaps correspond the two branches of the double branched legs found in present day arthropods, but at a stage before they fused together into one leg. We were excited to discover that it shows features that have not been observed in older Cambrian anomalocaridids  not one but two sets of swimming flaps along the trunk, representing a stage in the evolution of the two branched limb, characteristic of modern arthropods such as shrimps, Dr Briggs said.

Calculating body mass in animals that have been dead for many millions of years has been difficult for paleontologists. There are two methods one relies on researchers taking measurements of limb bones and extrapolating body mass from a large dataset of living animals, while the other produces a 3D model of the animal and applies densities to body segments to calculate mass. However, both often have varying results. Dr Brassey and her colleagues are the first to combine both methods to calculate the body mass of an extinct creature to get an accurate measurement. They used this approach on a specimen of the Jurassic dinosaur Stegosaurus stenops, which was found in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation near Shell, Wyoming, in 2003. They have calculated that the dinosaur would have weighed 1,560 kg, similar in weight to a small rhino. This finding identifies just how important exceptionally complete specimens like this are for scientific research and collections, said team member Prof Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum, who is the senior author of the paper published in the journal Biology Letters. Dr Susannah Maidment of Imperial College London, a co author of the paper, said our study is the first to attempt different methods on the same animal, and has highlighted how and why different body mass estimation methods come up with different results. Since the specimen arrived at the Natural History Museum in December 2013 and before it went on permanent public display one year later, the team created the 3D model of the skeleton by scanning, photographing and measuring each of its 360 bones. Because this incredible specimen is so complete, we have been able to create a 3D digital model of the whole fossil and each of its 360 bones, which we can research in excellent detail without using any of the original bones, said Dr Brassey, who is the first author of the paper. We also took the skeletons leg bone circumference and compared it to a modern animal of similar size, and came up with matching estimates for the dinosaurs weight. In addition to the findings in this study, the data will underpin a series of future scientific studies, which will uncover more about the unusual lifestyle of Stegosaurus. Now we know the weight, we can start to find out more about its metabolism, feeding requirements and the growth rates of Stegosaurus, Prof Barrett explained. We can also use the same techniques on other complete fossils to find out much more about the wider ecology of dinosaurs.

The modern Amazon River basin contains the worlds richest biota, but the origins of this extraordinary diversity are really poorly understood, said team member Dr John Flynn the American Museum of Natural History. Because its a vast rain forest today, our exposure to rocks  and therefore, also to the fossils those rocks may preserve  is extremely limited. Before the Amazon basin had its river, which formed about 10.5 million years ago, it contained a massive wetland system, filled with lakes, embayments, swamps, and rivers that drained northward toward the Caribbean. Knowing the kind of life that existed at that time is crucial to understanding the history and origins of modern Amazonian biodiversity. But although invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans are abundant in Amazonian fossil deposits, evidence of vertebrates other than fish have been very rare. The fossils of the three newly identified caiman species  Gnatusuchus pebasensis, Kuttanacaiman iquitosensis, and Caiman wannlangstoni  were recovered from the Pebas Formation in northeastern Peru. The strangest of the three is Gnatusuchus pebasensis, a short faced caiman with globular teeth that is thought to have used its snout to shovel mud bottoms, digging for clams and other mollusks. Dr Flynn and his colleagues suggest that the rise of Gnatusuchus pebasensis and other shell crunching durophagous crocs is correlated with a peak in mollusk diversity and numbers, which disappeared when the mega wetlands transformed into the modern Amazon River drainage system. When we analyzed Gnatusuchus bones and realized that it was probably a head burrowing and shoveling caiman preying on mollusks living in muddy river and swamp bottoms, we knew it was a milestone for understanding proto Amazonian wetland feeding dynamics, said Rodolfo Salas Gismondi, a graduate student at the University of Montpellier, France, who is the first author of the paper published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The scientists suggest that with the inception of the Amazon River System, mollusk populations declined and durophagous crocs went extinct as caimans with a broader palate diversified into the generalist feeders that dominate modern Amazonian ecosystems. Today, six species of caimans live in the whole Amazon basin, although only three ever co exist in the same area and they rarely share the same habitats. This is in large contrast to their ancient relatives, the seven diverse species that lived together in the same place and time, the scientists said.

The newly discovered species has been named Ichthyosaurus anningae. The species name honors the British collector, and woman in science, Mary Anning, who first collected ichthyosaurs in the early 1800s. Mary worked tirelessly to bring the ichthyosaurs, among other fossils, to the attention of the scientific world. Mary and her brother, Joseph, discovered the first ichthyosaur specimen to be scientifically recognized, collected at Lyme Regis around 1811, explained Dean Lomax, who is the first author of the paper published online in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. It is an honor to name a new species, but to name it after somebody who is intertwined with such an important role in helping to sculpt the science of paleontology, especially in Britain, is something that Im very proud of. In fact, one of the specimens in our study was even found by Mary herself Science is awesome, he said. The type specimen of Ichthyosaurus anningae had been in the collections of Doncaster Museum and Art Gallery for more than 30 years until Dean Lomax realized it was a new species. He first examined the fossil in 2008 when he noticed several abnormalities in the bone structure which made him think he had something previously unidentified. After examining the specimen extensively, both Prof Massare and I identified several unusual features of the limb bones humerus and femur that were completely different to any other ichthyosaur known, Dean Lomax said. That became very exciting. After examining perhaps over a thousand specimens we found four others with the same features as the Doncaster fossil. The paleontologists also looked at the size and age of Ichthyosaurus anningae, and enabled a look at differences between males and females. This included comparison with other groups of extant and extinct reptiles, whose limb bones are different between sexes, something that had never before been applied to ichthyosaurs. Dean Lomax concluded this discovery shows that new species, and not only ichthyosaurs, are awaiting discovery in museum collections. Not all new discoveries are made in the field.

Now, a study led by Dr Eva St\u00fceken from the University of Washington has found evidence that 3.2 billion years ago, life was already pulling nitrogen out of the air and converting it into a form that could support large and diverse biosphere. Dr St\u00fceken and her colleagues from the University of Johannesburg in South Africa and the University of Washingtons Department of Earth  Space Sciences analyzed 52 rock samples ranging in age from 2.75 to 3.2 billion years old, collected in South Africa and northwestern Australia. The rocks were formed from sediment deposited on continental margins, so are free of chemical irregularities that would occur near an underwater volcano. They also formed before the atmosphere gained oxygen, 2.3  2.4 billion years ago, and so preserve chemical clues that have disappeared in modern rocks. Even the oldest samples, 3.2 billion years old showed chemical evidence that life was pulling nitrogen out of the air. The ratio of heavier to lighter nitrogen atoms fits the pattern of nitrogen fixing enzymes contained in single celled organisms, and does not match any chemical reactions that occur in the absence of life. Imagining that this really complicated process is so old, and has operated in the same way for 3.2 billion years, I think is fascinating. It suggests that these really complicated enzymes apparently formed really early, so maybe its not so difficult for these enzymes to evolve, said Dr St\u00fceken, the first author of a paper published in the journal Nature. Genetic analysis of nitrogen fixing enzymes has placed their origin at between 1.5 and 2.2 billion years ago. This is hard evidence that pushes it back a further billion years, said co author Prof Roger Buick of the University of Washington. Fixing nitrogen means breaking a tenacious triple bond that holds nitrogen atoms in pairs in the atmosphere and joining a single nitrogen to a molecule that is easier for living things to use. The chemical signature of the rocks suggests that nitrogen was being broken by an enzyme based on molybdenum, the most common of the three types of nitrogen fixing enzymes that exist now. Molybdenum is now abundant because oxygen reacts with rocks to wash it into the ocean, but its source on the ancient Earth is more mysterious. Dr St\u00fceken and her colleagues hypothesize that this may be further evidence that some early life may have existed in single celled layers on land, exhaling small amounts of oxygen that reacted with the rock to release molybdenum to the water. Well never find any direct evidence of land scum one cell thick, but this might be giving us indirect evidence that the land was inhabited. Microbes could have crawled out of the ocean and lived in a slime layer on the rocks on land, even before 3.2 billion years ago, Prof Buick said.

Eotaria crypta was tiny, with adults being only slightly larger than a sea otter and around the size of a juvenile New Zealand fur seal. Its fossilized partial jaw, with several well preserved teeth, was recovered from a 15 17 million year old rock formation in Southern California in the early 1980s, but until now had been misidentified as belonging to a walrus species, explained Robert Boessenecker from the University of Otago, the first author of a paper published in the journal\u00a0Biology Letters. The fossil was deposited in what is now the John D. Cooper Archaeological and Paleontological Center, where Mr Boessenecker found it while searching through its collections. He instantly realized that it was not the small walrus Neotherium but a tiny, early fur seal. This was very exciting as fur seals and sea lions have a limited fossil record that, up until now, extended back to about 10 12 million years ago. Yet we know that their fossil record must go back to around 16 17 million years ago or so, because walruses have a record reaching back that far. In paleontology, a gap like this is known as a ghost lineage, and Eotaria crypta has now eliminated it. Until now we had no fossil evidence for the first five million years of fur seal and sea lion evolution. Its extremely satisfying to have remedied that, Mr Boessenecker said. The mystery remains of why there has only been one of these fur seals ever found given that there have been extensive fossil excavations of similarly aged rocks in California. Japanese paleontologist Dr Naoki Kohno of the Natural History Museum and Institute in Chiba has previously proposed that the earliest fur seals lived in the open ocean and only rarely strayed into continental shelf areas where they would be more likely to be preserved as fossils. This hypothesis is supported by this fossil having been collected from rock formed by sediments deposited in what was then continental shelf, rather than extensively studied inland fossil sites, such as Sharktooth Hill, that formed in bays, Mr Boessenecker said. "}, {"title": " Two New Jurassic Mammals Discovered in China", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Feb 13, 2015", "doc": "A team of paleontologists from China and the United States has described two shrew sized mammals that lived during the Jurassic period, between 165 and 160 million years ago. The first fossil, Agilodocodon scansorius, is the earliest known tree dwelling mammaliaform long extinct relatives of modern mammals. Its skeletal features suggest it was an agile and active arboreal animal, with claws for climbing and teeth adapted for a tree sap diet. This adaptation is similar to the teeth of some modern New World monkeys, and is the earliest known evidence of gumnivorous feeding in mammaliaforms. The animal also had well developed, flexible elbows and wrist and ankle joints that allowed for much greater mobility, all characteristics of climbing mammals. Agilodocodon scansorius was found in lake sediments of the 165 million years old Daohugou Fossil Site of Inner Mongolia of China. The other fossil, named Docofossor brachydactylus, is the earliest known subterranean mammaliaform. This animal lived in burrows and fed on worms and insects. It also has distinct skeletal features that resemble patterns shaped by genes identified in living mammals, suggesting these genetic mechanisms operated long before the rise of modern mammals. Docofossor brachydactylus was found in lake sediments of the Jurassic Ganggou fossil site in Hebei Province of China. It had reduced bone segments in its fingers, leading to shortened but wide digits. African golden moles possess almost the exact same adaptation, which provides an evolutionary advantage for digging mammals. This characteristic is due to the fusion of bone joints during development  a process influenced by the genes BMP and GDF 5. Because of the many anatomical similarities, the scientists hypothesize that this genetic mechanism may have played a comparable role in early mammal evolution, as in the case of Docofossor brachydactylus. The spines and ribs of both animals also show evidence for the influence of genes seen in modern mammals. Agilodocodon scansorius has a sharp boundary between the thoracic ribcage to lumbar vertebrae that have no ribs. However, Docofossor brachydactylus shows a gradual thoracic to lumber transition. These shifting patterns of thoracic lumbar transition have been seen in modern mammals and are known to be regulated by the genes Hox 9 10 and Myf 5 6. That these ancient mammaliaforms had similar developmental patterns is an evidence that these gene networks could have functioned in a similar way long before true mammals evolved. Early mammals were once thought to have limited ecological opportunities to diversify during the dinosaur dominated Mesozoic era. However, Agilodocodon scansorius and Docofossor brachydactylus, and numerous other fossils  including Castorocauda, a swimming, fish eating mammaliaform discovered in 2006  provide strong evidence that ancestral mammals adapted to wide ranging environments despite competition from dinosaurs. Agilodocodon scansorius and Docofossor brachydactylus are reported in two separate papers published in the journal Science paper 1  paper 2. We know that modern mammals are spectacularly diverse, but it was unknown whether early mammals managed to diversify in the same way, said Prof Zhe Xi Luo from the University of Chicago, who is a co author on both papers. These new fossils help demonstrate that early mammals did indeed have a wide range of ecological diversity.

The characteristics of the teeth of these early monkeys provide the first evidence that South American monkeys actually have an African ancestry. Until now, the oldest fossil records of New World monkeys  monkeys found in South America and Central America  have come from Salla, Bolivia and date to 26 million years ago Late Oligocene epoch. The new fossils indicate that monkeys first arrived in South America at least 36 million years ago. South America was an island continent for millions of years. Geographically isolated from Africa as a result of plate tectonics more than 65 million years ago, this continent witnessed the evolution of many unfamiliar groups of animals and plants. From time to time, animals more familiar to us today managed to arrive to this island landmass, their remains appearing abruptly in the fossil record. Yet, the earliest phases of the evolutionary history of monkeys in South America have remained cloaked in mystery. Long thought to have managed a long transatlantic journey from Africa, evidence for this hypothesis was difficult to support without fossil data. Dr Campbell and his co authors discovered the first of the new fossils in 2010, but because it was so strange to South America, it took an additional two years to realize that it was from a primitive monkey. Mounting evidence came as a result of further efforts to identify tiny fossils associated with the first find. Dr Campbell, who is a corresponding author of the paper published in the journal Nature, said these fossils push back the colonization of South America by monkeys by at least 10 million years.

Ergot has played roles as a medicine, a toxin, and a hallucinogen been implicated in everything from disease epidemics to the Salem witch trials and more recently provided the drug LSD. Apparently both ergot and the grasses that now form most of the diet for the human race evolved together. It seems like ergot has been involved with animals and humans almost forever, and now we know that this fungus literally dates back to the earliest evolution of grasses, said Dr Poinar, who is the first author of a paper accepted for publication in the journal Palaeodiversity. The newly discovered amber fossil dates about 100 million years ago to the middle Cretaceous, when the land was still dominated by dinosaurs and conifers, but the earliest flowering plants, grasses and small mammals were beginning to evolve. This is an important discovery that helps us understand the timeline of grass development, which now forms the basis of the human food supply in such crops as corn, rice or wheat. But it also shows that this parasitic fungus may have been around almost as long as the grasses themselves, as both a toxin and natural hallucinogen. Theres no doubt in my mind that it would have been eaten by sauropod dinosaurs, although we cant know what exact effect it had on them.

Ecphora mollusks represent an extinct group of gastropods that lived from the late Oligocene to the Pliocene. They are known for an unusual reddish brown shell color. This coloration is preserved in fossilized remains, unlike the fossilized shells of many other fossilized mollusks from the Calvert Cliffs region, Maryland, which have turned chalky white over the millions of years since they housed living creatures. Shells are made from crystalline compounds of calcium carbonate interleaved with an organic matrix of proteins and sugars proteins and sugars. These proteins are called shell binding proteins by scientists, because they help hold the components of the shell together. They also contain pigments, such as those responsible for the reddish brown appearance of the Ecphora shell. These pigments can bind to proteins to form a pigment protein complex. The fact that the coloration of fossilized Ecphora shells is so well preserved suggested to Dr Hazen and his colleagues that shell proteins bound to these pigments in a complex might also be preserved. They were amazed to find that the shells, once dissolved in dilute acid, released intact thin sheets of shell proteins more than a 1 cm across. Chemical analysis including spectroscopy and electron microscopy of these sheets revealed that they are indeed shell proteins that were preserved for up to 15 million years. These are some of the oldest and best preserved examples of a protein ever observed in a fossil shell, said Dr Hazen, who is the senior author of a paper published in the journal Geochemical Perspectives Letters. Remarkably, the proteins share characteristics with modern mollusk shell proteins. They both produce thin, flexible sheets of residue thats the same color as the original shell after being dissolved in acid. Of the 11 amino acids found in the resulting residue, aspartate and glutamate are prominent, which is typical of modern shell proteins. Further study of these proteins could be used for genetic analysis to trace the evolution of mollusks through the ages, as well as potentially to learn about the ecology of the Chesapeake Bay during the era in which Ecphora thrived.

Discovered in 2008, Josephoartigasia monesi is the largest fossil rodent ever found. This species was about 3 meters in length and had an estimated body mass of approximately 1,000 kg. In a new study, Dr Cox and his colleagues used computer modeling to estimate how powerful the bite of the species could be. The study involved CT scanning the Josephoartigasia monesi specimen and making a virtual reconstruction of its skull. This was then subjected to finite element analysis, an engineering technique that predicts stress and strain in a complex geometric object. The scientists found that, although the Josephoartigasia monesis bite forces were very large  around 1400 N, similar to that of a tiger, its incisors would have been able to withstand almost three times that force. We concluded that the rodent must have used its incisors for activities other than biting, such as digging in the ground for food, or defending itself from predators, said Dr Cox, the first author of a paper published in the Journal of Anatomy. This is very similar to how a modern day elephant uses its tusks.

William Schopf from the University of California, Los Angeles, has discovered a type of deep sea microorganism that appears not to have evolved over 2.3 billion years. Prof Schopf and his colleagues examined a mud inhabiting sulfur cycling microbial community that is 1.8 billion years old and was preserved in rocks from the Western Australian Duck Creek Formation. Using innovative techniques, including confocal laser scanning microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, they found that the bacteria are essentially identical both to\u00a0an older fossil community 2,300 million years old from the same region and to modern microbial biotas discovered off the coast of South America in 2007. It seems astounding that life has not evolved for more than 2 billion years  nearly half the history of the Earth. Given that evolution is a fact, this lack of evolution needs to be explained, said Prof Schopf, who is the first author on the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The researchers said that the organisms lack of evolution actually supports Charles Darwins theory of evolution. Prof Schopf explained the rule of biology is not to evolve unless the physical or biological environment changes, which is consistent with Darwin. The environment in which these microorganisms live has remained essentially unchanged for 3 billion years. These microorganisms are well adapted to their simple, very stable physical and biological environment. If they were in an environment that did not change but they nevertheless evolved, that would have shown that our understanding of Darwinian evolution was seriously flawed. He said the findings therefore provide further scientific proof for Darwins work. The fossils the scientists analyzed date back to a substantial rise in Earths oxygen levels known as the Great Oxidation Event, which scientists believe occurred between 2.2 billion and 2.4 billion years ago. The event also produced a dramatic increase in sulfate and nitrate  the only nutrients the microorganisms would have needed to survive in their seawater mud environment  which the scientists say enabled the bacteria to thrive and multiply. The fossils are interpreted to document the impact of the mid Precambrian increase of atmospheric oxygen, a world changing event that altered the history of life, the scientists wrote in the PNAS paper. Although the apparent 2 billion year long stasis of such sulfur cycling ecosystems is consistent with the null hypothesis required of Darwinian evolution, additional evidence will be needed to establish this aspect of evolutionary theory.

The new dinosaur, named Qijianglong guokr means Dragon of Qijiang, belongs to Mamenchisauridae, a family of dinosaurs known for their extremely long necks sometimes measuring up to half the length of their bodies. The neck vertebrae and the head of the dinosaur were found near Qijiang, Chongqing Municipality, southern China. It is rare to find a head and neck of a long necked dinosaur together because the head is so small and easily detached after the animal dies, said Tetsuto Miyashita, a PhD student at the University of Alberta and a co author of the paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Qijianglong guokr was about 15 meters in length. It had neck vertebrae that were filled with air, making the neck relatively lightweight despite its enormous size. Interlocking joints between the vertebrae also indicate a surprisingly stiff neck that was much more mobile bending vertically than sideways, similar to a construction crane. Qijianglong guokr is a cool animal. If you imagine a big animal that is half neck, you can see that evolution can do quite extraordinary things, Miyashita said. Mamenchisaurids are only found in Asia, but the discovery of Qijianglong guokr reveals that there could be as many differences among mamenchisaurids as there are between long necked dinosaurs from different continents. Qijianglong guokr shows that long necked dinosaurs diversified in unique ways in Asia during Jurassic times  something very special was going on in that continent. Nowhere else we can find dinosaurs with longer necks than those in China. The new dinosaur tells us that these extreme species thrived in isolation from the rest of the world, Miyashita said. Mamenchisaurids evolved into many different forms when other long necked dinosaurs went extinct in Asia. It is still a mystery why mamenchisaurids did not migrate to other continents. It is possible that the dinosaurs were once isolated as a result of a large barrier such as a sea, and lost in competition with invading species when the land connection was restored later. The skeleton of Qijianglong guokr is now housed in a local museum in Qijiang.

The discovery is changing the way scientists think about the origin of snakes, and how and when it happened. The previous oldest known fossil snakes date from the Upper Cretaceous 100 million year ago and are both morphologically and phylogenetically diverse, indicating that snakes underwent a much earlier origin and adaptive radiation. A new paper in the journal Nature Communications reports on fossils of four legged snakes named Eophis underwoodi, Portugalophis lignites, Diablophis gilmorei and Parviraptor estesi that extend the record backwards in time by an additional 70 million years. One of the four newly discovered species, Eophis underwoodi, is the worlds oldest known snake. It lived during the Bathonian stage of the Middle Jurassic, about 167 million years ago. Its fragmentary remains were recovered from Kirtlington Cement Works Quarry in Oxfordshire, England. Portugalophis lignites lived during the Kimmeridgian stage of the Upper Jurassic, between 157 and 152 million years ago. Its fossils were discovered in coal deposits near Guimarota, Portugal. The North American species, Diablophis gilmorei, was found in river deposits from some distance inland in western Colorado. It lived during the Kimmeridgian stage of the Upper Jurassic. The fossils of Parviraptor estesi were found in Durlston Bay, Dorset, England. The species lived during the Berriasian stage of the Early Cretaceous, between 145 and 140 million years ago. According to Prof Caldwell and his colleagues, their study makes it clear that the sudden appearance of snakes some 100 million years ago reflects a gap in the fossil record, not an explosive radiation of early snakes. From 167 to 100 million years ago, snakes were radiating and evolving toward the elongated, limb reduced body shape characterizing the now well known, 100 90 million year old, marine snakes from the West Bank, Lebanon and Argentina, that still possess small but well developed rear limbs, Prof Caldwell said. The identification of definitive snake skull features reveals that the fossils  previously associated with other non snake lizard remains  represent a much earlier time frame for the first appearance of snakes. Based on the new evidence and through comparison to living legless lizards that are not snakes, the paper explores the novel idea that the evolution of the characteristic snake skull and its parts appeared long before snakes lost their legs. The distribution of these newly identified oldest snakes, and the anatomy of the skull and skeletal elements, makes it clear that even older snake fossils are waiting to be found.

The new archosaur, named Nundasuchus songeaensis, is a 2.7 m long predatory reptile with steak knife like teeth and bony plates on the back. The name Nundasuchus songeaensis is Swahili mixed with Greek. The basic meaning of Nundasuchus is predator crocodile Nunda meaning predator in Swahili and suchus a reference to a crocodile in Greek, explained Dr Nesbitt, who is the first author of a paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. The songeaensis comes from the town, Songea, near where we found the bones, he said. Nundasuchus songeaensis is not a dinosaur, but one of the large reptiles that lived before dinosaurs took over the world. It was heavy bodied with limbs under its body like a dinosaur, but with bony plates on its back like a crocodilian. Nundasuchus songeaensis represents one of the more complete early Middle Triassic archosaurs from southern Pangea and is part of a previously unrecognized early and diverse archosauriform assemblage. The age of the reptile and the combination of character states that it possesses elucidate a number of interesting points about early archosaur evolution. The archosaur represents a new combination of character states that are not found together in previously known archosauriforms and would not have been predicted by our current vision of archosaur systematics. The partial skeleton of the reptile was unearthed in southwestern Tanzania in 2007. Although a large number of skeleton bones were found, most of the skull was not recovered despite three trips to the site and more than 1,000 hours spent painstakingly piecing the bones back together and cleaning them, Dr Nesbitt said. Theres such a huge gap in our understanding around the time when the common ancestor of birds and crocodilians was alive  there isnt a lot out there in the fossil record from that part of the reptile family tree, he said.

Post natal parental care seems to have evolved numerous times in vertebrates, with evidence of a long evolutionary history in diapsids  a group of amniotes which developed holes in each side of the skull about 300 million years ago and from which all existing lizards, snakes and birds are descended. However, evidence of this behavior is extremely rare in the fossil record and is only reported for pelycosaurs and two types of dinosaurs. The new study, published in the Geosciences Journal, presents evidence of post natal parental care in Philydrosaurus, a semi aquatic diapsid reptile that lived in what is now China during the Middle Jurassic. The specimen Dr Junchang Lu and his colleagues found is an apparent family group with an adult, surrounded by six juveniles of the same species. Given that the smaller individuals are of similar sizes, the paleontologists interpreted this as indicating an adult with its offspring, apparently from the same clutch. That Philydrosaurus shows parental care of the young after hatching suggests protection by the adult, presumably against predators. Their relatively small size would have meant that these reptiles were probably exposed to high predation pressure and strategies, such as live birth, and post natal parental care may have improved survival of the offspring, said co author Dr Charles Deeming from the University of Lincoln, UK. This specimen represents the oldest record of post natal parental care in diapsids to our knowledge and is the latest in an increasingly detailed collection of choristoderes exhibiting different levels of reproduction and parental care. A test of whether post natal parental care is an ancestral behavior that has persisted in the evolutionary development of amniotes will depend on future fossil discoveries.

During the time of dinosaurs, the waters of Scotland were prowled by big reptiles the size of motor boats. Their fossils are very rare, and only now, for the first time weve found a new species that was uniquely Scottish, said Dr Brusatte, who is the first author of a paper published in the Scottish Journal of Geology. The newfound species, named Dearcmhara shawcrossi, was a 4 meter long aquatic dolphin like reptile. It was near the top of the food chain and preyed on fish and other reptiles. Its specific name, shawcrossi, honors Brian Shawcross, an amateur enthusiast who recovered the creatures fossils from Bearreraig Bay on the Isle of Skye, in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland, in 1959. Dearcmhara  pronounced jark vara  is Scottish Gaelic for marine lizard, and pays homage to the history of Skye and the Hebrides, the paleontologists said. The species is one of the few to have ever been given a Gaelic name. They added it is likely that the specimens originate from the Bearreraig Sandstone Formation, assuming that the specimens were not transported to Bearreraig Bay from elsewhere by longshore drift. During the Jurassic period, much of Skye was under water. At the time, it was joined to the rest of what is now the United Kingdom and was part of a large island positioned between landmasses that gradually drifted apart and became Europe and North America. Skye is one of the few places in the world where fossils from the Middle Jurassic can be found, the scientists said. Discoveries made there could provide valuable insights into how marine reptiles evolved.

Dreadnoughtus schrani, a giant titanosaurian dinosaur from Argentina Dreadnoughtus schrani lived in temperate forests in what is now the south of South America during the Upper Cretaceous period, around 77 million years ago. This dinosaur was astoundingly huge  it weighed as much as a dozen African elephants or more than seven T. rexes. At about 26 m long and a mass of 59.3 tons, it is the largest land animal for which a body mass can be accurately calculated. 2. Pelagornis sandersi, the largest bird ever to fly Pelagornis sandersi is the largest flying bird yet discovered. At 6.4 m, the wingspan of this bird was about two times that of the Royal Albatross Diomedea exulans, the largest living flying bird. It lived in what is now North America approximately 28 million years ago. 3. Aquilops americanus, a small herbivorous dinosaur from Montana Aquilops americanus roamed what is now southern Montana during the Early Cretaceous epoch, about 108 million years ago. It belonged to a group of herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs called Ceratopsia, better known as horned dinosaurs. Aquilops americanus was about the size of a small cat, weighing around 1.6 kg and measuring around 60 cm in total length. Unlike its famous relatives, such as Triceratops, it lacked horns and a bony neck frill. It is the oldest species of horned dinosaur known from North America, about 40 million years older than the iconic horned dinosaur Triceratops, which weighed up to 4,000 times more. 4. Cartorhynchus lenticarpus, the first amphibious ichthyosaur Cartorhynchus lenticarpus, the smallest ichthyosaur to date, lived in the seas of what is now China during the upper Lower Triassic, approximately 248 million years ago. The preserved length of the specimen is 21.4 cm total body length is estimated to be only 40 cm. It represents a missing stage in the evolution of ichthyosaurs. Its amphibious characteristics include large flippers and flexible wrists, essential for crawling on the ground. 5. Tachiraptor admirabilis, a carnivorous dinosaur from Venezuela Tachiraptor admirabilis is a small bipedal theropod, with an estimated body length slightly over 1.5\u2009meters. It lived in what is now Venezuela during the earliest part of the Jurassic period, about 201 million years ago. It belonged to a sister group of Averostra, a large clade of theropod dinosaurs that is known primarily from the Middle Jurassic. 6. Ikrandraco avatar, a new species of pterosaur from China Named after the flying dragon like creatures from director James Camerons blockbuster 2009 movie Avatar, Ikrandraco avatar lived in what is now China during the Cretaceous period, about 120 millions years ago. It had a wingspan of about 2.5 meters and possessed a throat pouch similar to that of a pelican and probably fed on small fish from freshwater lakes, flying low over the water and catching prey by skimming its lower jaw into the water, and may have stored the fish in the pouch. 7. Atopodentatus unicus, a bizarre reptile from China Atopodentatus unicus lived in what is now China during the middle Triassic, between 247 and 242 million years ago. The reptile was about 3 m long and had a long body, short neck and special adaptations for a fully aquatic or semi aquatic lifestyle. The most distinguishing characteristic of Atopodentatus unicus is its bizarre mouth. On each side of the mouth, it had about 35 small needle like teeth in the front of the upper jaw, about 140 small needle like teeth in the rest of the upper jaw at least 100 in the horizontal portion and around 35 in the vertical portion, and more than 190 teeth in the lower jaw about 100 in the horizontal portion and 90 in the shovel headed anterior end. The teeth were covered by a layer of enamel. 8. Rhinorex condrupus, a new species of hadrosaur from Utah Rhinorex condrupus lived in swampy estuarial environments during the Cretaceous period, about 75 million years ago. It was about 9 meters long and weighed over 3,800 kg. Hadrosaurs are usually identified by bony crests that extended from the skull, but Rhinorex condrupus lacked a crest on the top of its head instead, it had a huge nose. 9. Leinkupal laticauda, a sauropod dinosaur from Argentina Leinkupal laticauda roamed what is now Argentina during the early Cretaceous, between 146 and 100 million years ago. It belongs to the family Diplodocidae, a group of sauropod dinosaurs recorded in late Jurassic strata from North America, Europe, Africa, and well known for their large bodies, as well as extremely long necks and tails. It is the first diplodocid discovered in South America, the second confirmed diplodocid for the ancient continent Gondwana and the youngest record of Diplodocidae in the world. Paleontologists estimate that Leinkupal laticauda could reach 9 meters long. 10. Torvosaurus gurneyi, a giant dinosaur from Portugal Torvosaurus gurneyi lived in what is today Europe during the Jurassic period, approximately 150 million years ago. It was about 10 m long and weighed 4 5 tons. It had blade shaped teeth up to 10 cm long, which indicates the dinosaur may have been at the top of the food chain. 11. Caiuajara dobruskii, a species of pterosaur from Brazil Caiuajara dobruskii lived in what is now southern Brazil between 94 and 72 million years ago, in the Cretaceous period. This reptile was gregarious, living in colonies, and most likely precocial, being able to fly at a very young age. 12. Kulindadromeus zabaikalicus, a feathered herbivorous dinosaur Kulindadromeus zabaikalicus roamed lake dotted lowlands of Jurassic Siberia, between 169 and 144 million years ago. It was a small plant eater, only about 1 meter long, had long hind legs and short arms. It had scales on its tail and shins, and short bristles on its head and back. It also had complex, compound feathers on its arms and legs. 13. Qianzhousaurus sinensis, a long snouted tyrannosaur from China Qianzhousaurus sinensis nicknamed Pinocchio rex lived in Asia during Cretaceous, about 66 million years ago. It measured about 9 m from snout to tail, and had an elongated skull, long teeth compared with the deeper, more powerful jaws and thick teeth of a conventional Tyrannosaurus. 14. Eocasea martini, the oldest known ancestor of land herbivores Eocasea martini, the oldest known ancestor of terrestrial herbivores, lived in what is today Kansas during Carboniferous period, about 300 million years ago.It was about 20 cm long and weighed less than 2 kg as an adult.

Dr Maeda and his colleagues studied the tissues in the fossilized eye of a 300 million year old fish, named Acanthodes bridgei. The specimen  an extinct species of fish that resembles a small shark  was uncovered from the Upper Carboniferous Hamilton Formation in Kansas, the United States. It was scanned under an electron microscope and further chemical analysis on the fossil showed evidence of cone cells and rods in the retina. This fossil fish eye is the first evidence to suggest animals saw in color as early as 300 million years ago, said Prof Andrew Parker of the Natural History Museum in London, who is a co author of the paper published in the journal Nature Communications. Parts of the visual system are not usually preserved in the fossil record because the soft tissue of the eye and brain decay rapidly after death. It is the first case of color vision in an ancient, extinct animal, proving color vision existed a long time before the Jurassic period, Prof Parker said. The retina of Acanthodes bridgei is very well preserved, enabling paleontologists to find the first record of cone cells and rods in animals. Prof Parker added these are both in the retina of a modern human and animal eye to enable color vision. We can now use these techniques to examine color pigments in other ancient animals, bringing us closer to the time when color vision first evolved.

The newly discovered creature belonged to Hupehsuchia, a group of enigmatic Triassic marine reptiles that is known exclusively from two counties in Hubei Province, China. One of the common features of the group was a modestly long neck with 9 10 cervical vertebrae. The new fossil, named Eohupehsuchus brevicollis, for the first time shows a short neck in this group, with six cervicals. It was collected during field excavation in 2011 from Jialingjiang Formation in Yangping, Yuanan County, Hubei Province, China. The left forelimb of this specimen is incomplete, ending with broken digits, the scientists said. They suspect the breakage occurred pre burial, possibly the result of a predator attack. The total length of Eohupehsuchus brevicollis would be about 40 cm, assuming the body proportion of Hupehsuchus. Analysis of related species led Dr Chens team to believe that Eohupehsuchus brevicollis forms the sister taxon of Hupehsuchidae. The results appear in a paper published this week in the open access journal PLoS ONE.

Alf Museum of Paleontology has described a new genus and species of ceratopsian dinosaur that lived in what is now southern Montana during the Early Cretaceous epoch, about 108 million years ago. The new dinosaur belongs to a group of herbivorous, beaked dinosaurs called Ceratopsia, better known as horned dinosaurs. Unlike its famous relatives, such as Triceratops, it lacked horns and a bony neck frill. It is named Aquilops americanus, meaning American eagle face. The genus name refers to the hook like beak at the front of the skull, used to snip plants during feeding. Aquilops americanus was about the size of a small cat, weighing around 1.6 kg and measuring around 60 cm in total length. It is the oldest species of horned dinosaur known from North America, about 40 million years older than the iconic horned dinosaur Triceratops, which weighed up to 4,000 times more. This dinosaur lived nearly 20 million years before the North Americas oldest previously known horned dinosaur, said Dr Farke, who is the lead author of the paper published in the journal PLoS ONE. Aquilops americanus partial skull and lower jaw were uncovered from the Cloverly Formation in Montana in 1997. The skull is comparatively small, measuring 8.4 cm long, and is distinguished by several features, including a strongly hooked rostral bone and an elongated and sharply pointed cavity over the cheek region, Dr Farke said. He added Aquilops americanus is the first fossil to show what the earliest horned dinosaurs in North America looked like. Surprisingly, the new dinosaur turns out to be more closely related to ceratopsians from Asia than to other ceratopsians from North America. We were surprised that it was more closely related to Asian animals than those from North America, Dr Farke said. This is consistent with evidence from other animals, including carnivorous dinosaurs as well as early mammals, showing an immigration of species from Asia into North America sometime between 115 and 105 million years ago. Aquilops americanus will be stored in the vertebrate paleontology collection at the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History in Norman, Oklahoma.

The new fossil belongs to a now extinct family of bizarre, balloon shaped animals known as Chancelloriidae. It was uncovered from the Cambrian Series 2 Heilinpu Formation near Chengjiang, Yunnan Province, China. There is only one fossil of this enigmatic animal after thirty years of collecting by our Chinese colleagues at Chengjiang. It is exceptionally rare, but it shows us just how strange and varied the shapes of early animals could be, said Dr Harvey, who is a co author of the paper describing the discovery in the journal Scientific Reports. He and his co authors named the animal Nidelric pugio after the late Prof Richard Aldridge, an internationally renowned paleontologist and keen ornithologist formerly of the University of Leicester. We are glad the fossil can honor the name of Prof Richard Aldridge, who was a leader in this field and whose research was vital in better understanding the rich tapestry of fossils found at Chengjiang, Dr Harvey explained. In life Nidelric pugio was about 9 cm long and was covered in spines, but the squashed fossil resembles a birds nest. In southern China, rocks 520 million years old at Chengjiang yield a diverse array of fossils preserved with traces of their soft anatomy, including their legs, eyes, guts and even brains, Dr Harvey said. Amongst the fossils are many animals that can be related to modern forms, including distant relatives of arthropods such as crabs and lobsters, and a wide variety of worms. There are also several enigmatic fossils that dont seem to fit in with anything living today, and amongst these are the chancelloriids. These fossils provide an unprecedented view of life in Earths ancient seas.

Scientists have been trying to piece together information on these extinctions for decades. Was it the result of over hunting by early people in North America? Was it the rapid global warming at the end of the ice age? Did all of these big mammals go out in one dramatic die off, or were they paced over time and due to a complex set of factors? said Dr Ross MacPhee of the American Museum of Natural History, who is a co author of the paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Mastodons are members of the group of mammals called proboscideans, which was once much more diverse and widespread. Only two species survive today, the African and Asian elephants, both threatened with extinction. Mastodons roamed widely over continental North America as well as peripheral locations like the tropics of Honduras and the Arctic coast of Alaska for roughly 3.5 million years before it finally became extinct about 10,000 years ago. They were browsing specialists that relied on woody plants and lived in coniferous or mixed woodlands with lowland swamps. Mastodon teeth were effective at stripping and crushing twigs, leaves, and stems from shrubs and trees. So it would seem unlikely that they were able to survive in the ice covered regions of Alaska and Yukon during the last full glacial period, as previous fossil dating has suggested, said lead author Dr Grant Zazula of the Government of Yukons Palaeontology Program. The scientists used two different types of precise radiocarbon dating on a collection of 36 fossil teeth and bones of American mastodons. The dating methods are designed to only target material from bone collagen, not accompanying slop, including preparation varnish and glues that were used many years ago to strengthen the specimens. All of the fossils were found to be older than previously thought, with most surpassing 50,000 years, the effective limit of radiocarbon dating. When taking mastodon habitat preferences and other ecological and geological information into account, the results indicate that mastodons probably only lived in the Arctic and Subarctic for a limited time around 125,000 years ago, when forests and wetlands were established and the temperatures were as warm as they are today. The residency of mastodons in the north did not last long. The return to cold, dry glacial conditions along with the advance of continental glaciers around 75,000 years ago effectively wiped out their habitats, Dr Zazula said. Mastodons disappeared from Beringia, and their populations became displaced to areas much farther to the south, where they ultimately suffered complete extinction about 10,000 years ago.

Western North America hosted a remarkable diversity of dinosaurs during the Campanian period  the fifth of six ages of the Late Cretaceous epoch. Among the most diverse groups was the Chasmosaurinae. Up until now, ten chasmosaurine species have been recognized from the upper Campanian of western North America, with distinct species occurring in the northern and southern parts of the continent. The fossilized bones of two horned dinosaurs studied by Dr Longrich were previously classified as Anchiceratops and Chasmosaurus, species known from Canada, but after re analyzing the skeletons, he realized they more closely resembled dinosaurs from the American Southwest. One was closely related to Pentaceratops sternbergii from New Mexico, but is a more primitive species. Scientifically named Pentaceratops aquilonius, it was smaller, and differed in the shape of the frill and arrangement of the hornlets on the back. The other seems to be related to the genus Kosmoceratops from Utah. It seems to be a new species as well, but more complete fossils are needed to be certain. In a paper published in the journal Cretaceous Research, Dr Longrich proposes that distinct northern and southern provinces existed during the Campanian, but that there was exchange between them. The dinosaurs would spread from one part of the continent to the other and then diverge to form new species. Competition between the different species then prevented the dinosaurs from moving between the northern and southern regions. The distribution of dinosaur species was very different from the patterns seen in living mammals. In living mammals, there tend to be relatively few large species, and they have large ranges. With Cretaceous dinosaurs, we see a lot of large species in a single habitat. They also tend to be very regional  as you move from one habitat to another, you get a completely different set of species.

The discovery fills in a major gap in understanding of the evolution of Perissodactyla, a group of animals that includes horses and rhinos. Perissodactyla perissodactyls is a small order of hoofed mammals, containing three extant families Equidae horses, Tapiridae tapirs, and Rhinocerotidae rhinoceroses. Also known as odd toed ungulates, perissodactyls have an uneven number of toes on their hind feet and a distinctive digestive system. Though paleontologists had found remains of Perissodactyla from as far back as the beginnings of the Eocene epoch, about 56 million years ago, their earlier evolution remained a mystery, said Prof Kenneth Rose of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who is the first author of a paper published in the journal Nature Communications. In 1990, Dr David Krause and Dr Mary Maas of Stony Brook University suggested that several groups of mammals that appear at the beginning of the Eocene, including perissodactyls, even toed ungulates and primates, might have evolved in India while it was isolated. The fossilized remains of an early perissodactyl animal uncovered from the Cambay Shale Formation in Gujarat, India, are the first concrete evidence to support that hypothesis. The animal, named Cambaytherium thewissi, was the size of a pig and likely weighed 25 30 kg. Prof Rose and his colleagues dated the fossils to about 54.5 million years old, making them slightly younger than the oldest known perissodactyls. It provides a window into what a common ancestor of all Perissodactyla would have looked like, Prof Rose said. Many of Cambaytherium thewissis features, like the teeth, the number of sacral vertebrae, and the bones of the hands and feet, are intermediate between Perissodactyla and more primitive animals. This is the closest thing weve found to a common ancestor of the Perissodactyla order. Cambaytherium thewissi and other finds from the Cambay Shale Formation also provide tantalizing clues about Indias separation from Madagascar, lonely migration, and eventual collision with the continent of Asia as the Earths plates shifted. Around Cambaytheriums time, we think India was an island, but it also had primates and a rodent similar to those living in Europe at the time, Prof Rose said. One possible explanation is that India passed close by the Arabian Peninsula or the Horn of Africa, and there was a land bridge that allowed the animals to migrate. But Cambaytherium thewissi is unique and suggests that India was indeed isolated for a while.

The dodo Raphus cucullatus by Frederick William Frohawk, 1905. The dodo Raphus cucullatus is an extinct flightless bird that lived on the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. The bird was first discovered by European sailors in 1598, and was extinct by 1680. It was about 1 m tall, weighed 10 23 kg and had blue gray plumage, a big head, a long bill, small useless wings, stout yellow legs, and a tuft of curly feathers high on its rear end. Although the dodos were easy to catch, their meat was not that tasty their rapid decline was probably due less to hunting, and more to the fact that the dogs, cats, rats and pigs, introduced to Mauritius, destroyed the dodos eggs and habitat. The only known near complete skeleton of a single individual of the dodo was found by amateur naturalist Etienne Thirioux on Mauritius more than a century ago. This specimen, housed at the Natural History Museum in Port Louis, Mauritius, has never been described, and many details regarding its provenance and its collector have remained obscure. Etienne Thirioux assembled another exceptional, partially associated skeleton of the dodo, housed at the Durban Museum of Natural Science in South Africa. Now, scientists from Mauritius and three European countries have released the first ever 3D scans of these specimens, offering crucial insights into how the dodo may have evolved its giant size, how it walked and lived in its forest home. The Thirioux dodos contain previously unknown or undescribed skeletal elements, including the patellae and tarsal sesamoids. They also preserve relative skeletal proportions that cannot be gleaned from other composite skeletons, the scientists said. Examination of the scans supports the interpretation that the Port Louis specimen largely derives from a single individual, and that the Durban skeleton is a partial composite that contains a large number of associated bones, including the pectoral girdle. The relative proportions of the dodo hind limb skeleton are similar to smaller flying columbids, but the bones are much more robust. Study co author Dr Kenneth Rijsdijk from the University of Amsterdam said having a complete single individual has allowed study of the dodos sternum breastbone in context. Its size relative to the closely related extinct flightless Rodrigues solitaire Pezophaps solitaria, which was known to have used its wings in combat, but lacking a keel on the sternum, unlike flying pigeons and the Rodrigues solitaire indicates that the dodo may have shown less intraspecific antagonistic behavior. Study lead author Dr Leon Claessens the College of the Holy Cross said the history of the dodo provides an important case study of the effects of human disturbance of the ecosystem, from which there is still much to learn that can inform modern conservation efforts for todays endangered animals. The results were presented at the 74th Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. Leon Claessens et al. 2014.

The Steppe bison Bison priscus by Constantine Flerow, 1989. The Yukagir bison mummy, as the find was dubbed, has a complete brain, heart, blood vessels and digestive system, although some organs have shrunk significantly over time. It is a male about 4 4.5 years old and has an accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon date of about 9,300 years before present, Dr Olga Potapova from the Mammoth Site of Hot Springs in South Dakota and her colleagues reported in a presentation at the 74th Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. The Yukagir bison mummy became the third find out of four now known complete mummies of this species discovered in the world, and one out of two adult specimens that are being kept preserved with internal organs and stored in frozen conditions, making this find one of high importance, Dr Potapova said. The scientists completed the necropsy of the bison mummy to examine topography, anatomy, and state of the inner organs preservation, overall health condition, presence of parasites, cause of death, and to compare it with extinct and extant Bison and Bos taxa. The mummy possessed completely preserved inner organs, but some of them were not identified. The organs were removed in four separate parts for the detailed study, tissue sampling, and preservation. The brain represents the first record for the species that appears to be complete, the scientists said. Some torso organs, including trachea, heart with pericardium and large blood vessels, stomach, and penis, appeared to be close to normal sizes. Other inner organs or their parts, such as the brain, tricuspid and bicuspid heart valves, pulmonary and aorta semilunar valves, papillary muscles, small blood vessels, esophagus, lungs, liver, rumen papillae, reticular crests and cells, omasal laminae, intestines, and left testicle were significantly shrunk. The trachea and lungs didnt contain foreign objects. The esophagus and rectum were free from food remnants. The rumen and reticulum were filled with vegetation mass containing shrub and tree brunches and roots, while the jejunum contained some chyme. The general topography of the Yukagir bison corresponds to Bison and Bos, but morphology, sizes, and volumes of some organs are largely due to the bodys mummification for thousands of years in permafrost conditions. No visible parasites in the examined organs, pathological tissues, or injury were revealed. The lack of visible subcutaneous fat in the abdomen and neck areas indicates that starvation might have caused the animals death. Team member Dr Evgeny Maschenko added the exclusively good preservation of the Yukagir bison mummy allows direct anatomical comparisons with modern species of Bison and cattle, as well as with extinct species of bison that were gone at the Pleistocene Holocene boundary. The next steps to be done include further examination of the bisons gross anatomy, and other detailed studies on its histology, parasites, and bones and teeth. We expect that the results of these studies will reveal not only the cause of death of this particular specimen, but also might shed light on the species behavior and causes of its extinction, Dr Potapova said.

The track sizes, proportions, digit lengths and divarications are similar to the Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic ichnogenus Ameghinichnus however, the average length of 2.7 cm and width of 3.2 cm suggest the track maker was as big as a modern raccoon, Marco Marzola and his colleagues reported in a presentation at the 74th Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. Exceptionally large for its time, it is comparable in size to Repenomamus, the largest known Cretaceous mammal body fossil, with a total length up to 68 cm. The tracks are much too large to have been produced by Early Cretaceous Abelodon from Cameroon, or the gondwanathere reported from Tanzania. Another trackway was attributed to an ancient crocodile and has a unique laterally rotated handprint. In addition, 18 dinosaur tracks were found nearby, one of which preserves a skin impression. These are the first dinosaur tracks found in Angola. For almost 8 months, the Catoca mine stopped mining the sector, in order to make the study possible. Marzola, M et al. 2014.

The discovery is the first to link the dolphin like ichthyosaur to its terrestrial ancestors, filling a gap in the fossil record. The fossil, named Cartorhynchus lenticarpus, represents a missing stage in the evolution of ichthyosaurs. Until now, there were no fossils marking their transition from land to sea. But now we have this fossil showing the transition. Theres nothing that prevents it from coming onto land, said Prof Motani, who is the first author of a paper published in the journal Nature. Prof Motani and his colleagues from the United States, China and Italy, discovered the fossil in the Majiashan Quarry near Hefei City, Anhui Province. Cartorhynchus lenticarpus is the smallest ichthyosaur to date. The preserved length of the specimen is 21.4 cm total body length is estimated to be only 40 cm. Its amphibious characteristics include large flippers and flexible wrists, essential for crawling on the ground. Most ichthyosaurs had long, beak like snouts, but Cartorhynchus lenticarpus shows a nose as short as that of land reptiles. Its body also contains thicker bones than previously described ichthyosaurs. This is in keeping with the idea that most marine reptiles who transitioned from land first became heavier, for example with thicker bones, in order to swim through rough coastal waves before entering the deep sea. Unlike more derived ichthyosaurs, Cartorhynchus lenticarpus was probably a suction feeder. It lived about 4 million years after the PermianTriassic extinction event that occurred 252 million years ago. Scientists have wondered how long it took for animals and plants to recover after such destruction, particularly since the extinction was associated with global warming. This was analogous to what might happen if the world gets warmer and warmer. How long did it take before the globe was good enough for predators like this to reappear? In that world, many things became extinct, but it started something new, Prof Motani said. These reptiles came out during this recovery.

The new fossil mammal, named Vintana sertichi, belongs to Gondwanatheria or gondwanatherians, a group of early mammals that lived during the Cretaceous through the Miocene in the Southern Hemisphere, including Antarctica. The animals skull was huge, measuring 13 cm long  twice the size of the previously largest known mammalian skull from the entire Age of Dinosaurs of the southern supercontinent Gondwana. Prof Krause and his colleagues conducted a comprehensive analysis of the fossil, much of it using micro computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy to reveal minute aspects of its anatomy, including areas like the braincase, nasal cavity, and inner ear that are poorly known in almost all early mammals. They also compared the skull to those of hundreds of other fossil and extant mammals. We know next to nothing about early mammalian evolution on the southern continents. This discovery, from a time and an area of the world that are very poorly sampled, underscores how very little we know. No paleontologist could have come close to predicting the odd mix of anatomical features that this skull exhibits, said Prof Krause, who is the first author of a paper published in the journal Nature. At a time when the vast majority of mammals were mouse sized, Vintana sertichi was a super heavyweight. The animal had a body mass of about 9 kg, almost three times the size of an adult groundhog. Various features of its teeth, eye sockets, nasal cavity, braincase, and inner ears revealed that it was a large eyed herbivore that was agile, with keen senses of hearing and smell.

These and other features were also used to analyze its relationships to other early mammals. The results show that Vintana sertichi and other gondwanatherians were close relatives of multituberculates, the most successful mammalian contemporaries of dinosaurs on the northern continents. Multituberculates and gondwanatherians also grouped with another enigmatic taxon, the Haramiyida. The current study is the first to find strong evidence for clustering these three groups together, primarily because the cranial anatomy of gondwanatherians was previously completely unknown. Dr Zhe Xi Luo of University of Chicago, who was not involved in the study, said that Vintana sertichi is the discovery of the decade for understanding the deep history of mammals it offers the best case of how plate tectonics and biogeography have impacted animal evolution  a lineage of mammals isolated on a part of the ancient Gondwana had evolved some extraordinary features beyond our previous imagination. Vintana sertichi is also a galvanizing discovery for the future decades, he said. With features so remarkably different from those of other mammals previously known to science, this fossil tells us how little we knew about the early evolution of mammals  it will stimulate paleontologists to conduct more field exploration in order to advance the frontier of deep time history and evolution.

The new dinosaur is named Zaraapelta nomadis. It belongs to Ankylosauridae, a family of herbivorous dinosaurs with armored plates on their back. The genus name Zaraapelta is a combination of the Mongolian and Greek works for hedgehog and shield in reference to its spiky appearance. The species name nomadis honors the Mongolian company Nomadic Expeditions, which has facilitated paleontological fieldwork in the Gobi Desert for almost two decades. Zaraapelta nomadis skull that is missing the front of the snout was uncovered from the Upper Cretaceous Baruungoyot Formation of Mongolia in 2000. Like some of the other ankylosaurs from the Gobi Desert, the top of its skull was bumpy and spiky. At the back of its skull there are distinctive horns with a prominent ridge along the top. Now, the skull is part of the collections of the Mongolian Paleontological Center in Ulaanbaatar. The elaborate and distinctive ornamentation on the skulls of Zaraapelta nomadis and other Mongolian ankylosaurs may have evolved as a way to show off to members of the opposite sex, said Dr Victoria Arbour of the University of Alberta, who is the lead author of a study published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. It has long been thought that other kinds of dinosaurs, like the crested hadrosaurs or ceratopsians with their horns and frills, used these ornaments during sexual displays, but the idea hasnt been applied to ankylosaurs. In addition to naming the new ankylosaur Zaraapelta nomadis, this study also re examined previously named ankylosaurs from Mongolia and found support for resurrecting a species that had been discarded by earlier studies. Sometimes, researchers might determine that two species names represent only one actual species, in which case the name that was created first has priority. This was the case for an ankylosaur called Tarchia kielanae, which was eventually thought to be the same kind of ankylosaur as Tarchia gigantean, Dr Arbour said. But new information from recent dinosaur discoveries, including this study, suggests that Tarchia kielanae might be a separate species after all, so the name has been brought back into use.

Carcharocles megalodon ruled the oceans for more than 10 million years, from the middle Miocene to the Pliocene. It was a top level predator that fed on whales and other marine mammals. This prehistoric monster had a cartilaginous skeleton and was therefore poorly preserved with exception of its teeth, but paleontologists believe that it looked a lot like the extant great white shark, only far larger. The largest specimens would have weighed around 100 tons and reached 20 meters in length. Despite its popularity and widespread fossil record, remarkably little is known about the extinction of Carcharocles megalodon. In a new study, Dr Clements and Catalina Pimiento analyzed the most recent records of this species from the literature and scientific collections and calculated the time of its extinction using a novel mathematical model called Optimal Linear Estimation OLE. The results show that Carcharocles megalodon went extinct around 2.6 million years ago, This study will not only serve as a key reference for debunking the myth that the shark still exists, but its novel methods will influence the future of scientific research of extinct animals and plants, Dr Jorge Velez Juarbe of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, who was not involved in the study. The methodology that the authors used had only been previously employed to determine extinction dates in historical times, such as to estimate the extinction date of the dodo bird. In this work, they applied that same methodology to determine the extinction of an organism millions of years ago, instead of hundreds. Its a new tool that paleobiologists didnt have, or rather had not thought of using before. Catalina Pimiento, who is the first author of a paper published in the journal PLoS ONE, said when we calculated the time of megalodons extinction, we noticed that the modern function and gigantic sizes of filter feeder whales became established around that time. Future research will investigate if megalodons extinction played a part in the evolution of these new classes of whales.

For almost five decades this theropod dinosaur, named Deinocheirus mirificus, has remained one of the most mysterious prehistoric creatures. It was known only from a pair of 2.4 m long forelimbs discovered in the Nemegt Formation, Mongolia, in 1965. The size of the limbs led some paleontologists to believe the dinosaur would be much larger than Tyrannosaurus rex, with its notoriously puny front limbs. Now, with the discovery of two Deinocheirus mirificus skeletons in the Gobi desert, Dr Chinzorigs team has produced the first accurate reconstruction of the dinosaur. According to the scientists paper in the journal Nature, Deinocheirus mirificus was approximately 11 meters long and had an estimated weight of 6.4 tons. It was a behemoth to be sure  but hardly the giant tyrannosaur its massive arms may have suggested. Rather, the apparently disproportionately large forearms were more likely used for digging and gathering plants in freshwater habitats, or for fishing. Among its other unusual attributes are tall dorsal spines, truncated hoof like claws on the feet to prevent sinking into muddy ground, and bulky hind legs that indicate it was a slow mover, said co author Prof Philip Currie of the University of Albertas Department of Biological Sciences. It almost appears to be a chimera, with its ornithomimid like arms, its tyrannosaurid like legs, its Spinosaurus like vertebral spines, its sauropod like hips, and its hadrosaur like duckbill and foot hooves. Deinocheirus mirificus is a descendant of ostrich like dinosaurs that were only slightly larger than humans, so its evolution into a giant creature is almost certainly responsible for most of its unusual characteristics. Its great size probably gave it some protection from the tyrannosaurid Tarbosaurus, which appears to have been relatively common in that part of Mongolia 70 million years ago, Prof Currie said. To feed its great bulk, the dinosaur was apparently an omnivore that ingested both plants and fish, as evident from fish remains found in its stomach contents.

The Mesozoic fossil record includes more than 120 species of birds found worldwide. Over the last three decades, paleontologists have made important discoveries of fossil bird eggs including those of Gobipteryx and possible neognathid birds from Mongolia, ornithothoraces from Argentina, enantiornithines from China and bird like theropods from Spain. In contrast, the Brazilian record of Mesozoic birds is restricted to skeletal fragments of enantiornithine birds from the Upper Cretaceous Bauru Group of Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, and two possible specimens from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Member of the Araripe Basin. Now, Dr Julio Cesar de A. Marsola of the University of Sao Paulo and his colleagues have discovered a fossilized egg of a bird that lived in what is today Brazil during the Mesozoic era, between 252 and 66 million years ago. The egg, labeled LPRP USP 0359, was recovered from Upper Cretaceous deposits of the Vale do Rio do Peixe Formation in the Bauru Group of Sao Paulo. Although no remains were found inside it, the scientists extensive analysis revealed important information about both the egg itself and its wider context. Their observations suggest that the egg is, in fact, one of the smallest and thinnest shelled Mesozoic bird eggs ever found. It is slightly compressed, with its main axes measuring 3.14 cm x 1.95 cm. The shell is 125.5 \u03bcm thick and externally smooth with rounded pore openings. Similarities between the egg and specimens from Argentina suggest an affinity between them as Ornithothoraces, a group of birds that includes all enantiornithines and modern birds. Given further similarities in where and how the eggs were found, the team suggests that the two birds may also have preferred the same types of breeding and nesting habitats  important clues that will help paleontologists build up a more detailed picture of South Americas Mesozoic past. The discovery is detailed in a paper published online in the Alcheringa an Australasian Journal of Palaeontology. "}, {"title": " Extinct Giant Kangaroos Walked Instead of Hopped", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Oct 16, 2014", "doc": "According to a study carried out by scientists from Spain and the United States, members of Sthenurinae  an ancient family of kangaroos that lived until 30,000 years ago  likely preferred walking to hopping. Sthenurinae sthenurine kangaroos was an extinct subfamily within the family Macropodidae kangaroos and rat kangaroos. These short faced, large bodied browsers first appeared in the middle Miocene, and radiated in the Plio Pleistocene into a diversity of mostly large bodied forms, more robust than extant forms in their build. The largest of these animals, Procoptodon goliah, had an estimated body mass of 240 kg, almost three times the size of the largest living kangaroos, and there is speculation whether a kangaroo of this size would be biomechanically capable of hopping gait. Previous studies suggested that sthenurine kangaroos specialized forelimbs and rigid lumbar spine would limit their ability to move slowly, using the tail as a fifth limb, as is typical of smaller kangaroos. Instead, Dr Borja Figueirido of the University of Malaga in Spain and his colleagues posit that sthenurines adopted a walking gait on two hind legs. In the smaller and earlier forms, this gait may have been used as an alternative to using the tails as fifth limb at slower speeds. Larger Pleistocene kangaroos may have used this gait exclusively as they evolved larger body sizes, where hopping rapidly was no longer a possible option. The researchers make their case based on statistical and biomechanical analyses of the bones of sthenurine and other kangaroos past and present. In all, they made nearly 100 measurements on each of more than 140 individual kangaroo and wallaby skeletons from many genera and species. Extant kangaroos hop at fast speeds and move about on all fours for slow speed travel. This requires a flexible backbone, sturdy tail, and hands that can support their body weight. Sthenurines dont appear to have had any of those attributes, said Prof Christine Janis of Brown University, who is the first author of the paper published in the journal PLoS ONE. Whether any of the sthenurines still hopped to attain fast speeds, bipedal walking was much more likely to be at least their mode of slow speed locomotion. The hypothesis that sthenurines were walkers would still benefit from other lines of evidence such the discovery of preserved tracks. But until that is found, the balance of the anatomy shows that these roos were specialized  and sometimes sized  for walking, not for hopping, Prof Janis said.

The newly discovered dinosaur is a small bipedal theropod, with an estimated body length slightly over 1.5\u2009meters. It belongs to a sister group of Averostra, a large clade of theropod dinosaurs that is known primarily from the Middle Jurassic. The paleontologists found only two fossilized bones of the new dinosaur in the La Quinta Formation, about 4\u2009km northwest of the town of La Grita in T\u00e1chira, Venezuela. They named the new genus and species  Tachiraptor admirabilis. The genus name tachiraptor derives from T\u00e1chira and raptor Latin for thief, in reference to the probable predatory habits of the animal, the team explained in a paper published in the journal Royal Society Open Science. The specific name admirabilis honors Simon Bolivars Admirable Campaign, in which the town of La Grita played a strategic role. Tachiraptor admirabilis probably preyed upon any smaller creature it could catch, including a recently discovered plant eating dinosaur called Laquintasaura venezuelae. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Find Evidence of Battle between Two Triassic Predators", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Sep 29, 2014", "doc": "The evidence comes from a team of U.S. scientists who found remnants of a prehistoric clash in a slab of rock at the Chinle Formation in New Mexico. The battle, which occurred in the Triassic period about 210 million years ago, involved a semi aquatic crocodile like dinosaur called phytosaur and a large reptile called rauisuchid, and ended with the tooth of the former embedded in the bone of the latter. About 210 million years ago when the supercontinent of Pangea was starting to break up, phytosaurs and rauisuchids were apex predators at the top of the food chain. It was widely believed these two predators didnt interact much as phytosaurs were kings of the water, and rauisuchids roamed the land. But those ideas are changing, thanks largely to the contents of a single bone. To find a phytosaur tooth in the bone of a rauisuchid is very surprising, said Dr Stephanie Drumheller of the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, a team member and the lead author of a paper published in the journal Naturwissenschaften. These rauisuchids were the largest predators in their environments. You might expect them to be the top predators as well, but here we have evidence of phytosaurs, who were smaller, semi aquatic animals, potentially targeting and eating these big carnivores. Dr Drumheller and her colleagues studied the bone of a rauisuchid and the phytosaur tooth using their 3D printed copies and CT scans. This, along with an analysis of bite marks, revealed that the animal was preyed upon at least twice over the course of its life, by phytosaurs. Phytosaurs were thought to be dominant aquatic predators because of their large size and similarity to modern crocodylians, but we were able to provide the first direct evidence they targeted both aquatic and large terrestrial prey, said co author Dr Michelle Stocker from Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. This research will call for us to go back and look at some of the assumptions weve had in regard to the Late Triassic ecosystems. The distinctions between aquatic and terrestrial distinctions were over simplified and I think weve made a case that the two spheres were intimately connected, the scientist concluded.

In their study, reported in the journal Current Biology, Dr Brusatte and his colleagues examined the evolutionary links between ancient birds and coelurosaurs  a subgroup of theropod dinosaurs closely related to birds. The scientists analyzed the anatomical make up of more than 853 body features in 150 species of coelurosaurs and then assembled a detailed family tree. They found that the familiar anatomical features of birds  such as feathers, wings and wishbones  all first evolved in their dinosaur ancestors. Once a fully functioning bird body shape was complete, an evolutionary explosion began, causing a rapid increase in the rate at which birds evolved. This led eventually to the thousands of bird species that we know today. The findings support a controversial theory proposed by George Gaylord Simpson in the 1940s that the emergence of new body shapes in groups of species could result in a surge in their evolution. The evolution of birds from their dinosaur ancestors was a landmark in the history of life. This process was so gradual that if you traveled back in time to the Jurassic, youd find that the earliest birds looked indistinguishable from many other dinosaurs, said co author Dr Steve Wang of Swarthmore College. Dr Brusatte added there was no moment in time when a dinosaur became a bird, and there is no single missing link between them. What we think of as the classic bird skeleton was pieced together gradually over tens of millions of years. Once it came together fully, it unlocked great evolutionary potential that allowed birds to evolve at a super charged rate. Our study adds to a growing number of works that approach this problem from different angles, but all seem to confirm that the origin of birds was a truly special event in Earth history, said co author Dr Graeme Lloyd of the University of Oxford. It is particularly cool that it is evidence from the fossil record that shows how an oddball offshoot of the dinosaurs paved the way for the spectacular variety of bird species we see today.

Mysterious spherical microfossils from the Ediacaran 630 542 million years ago  the period immediately preceding the Cambrian  were uncovered from phosphorite rocks of the Doushantuo Formation in central Guizhou Province, China, in 1997. Several previous studies have interpreted these microorganisms, called Megasphaera, as bacteria, single cell eukaryotes, algae, bilaterally symmetrical animals or transitional forms related to modern animals such as sponges and sea anemones. However, their complete life cycle has been unknown  until now. In a new study, published in the journal Nature, a team of paleontologists led by Dr Xunlai Yuan of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology describes new Megasphaera microfossils from the Doushantuo Formation that have been overlooked in the earlier studies. These fossils represent later developmental stages of Megasphaera and show evidence for cell differentiation, germ soma separation, and programmed cell death  qualities of complex multicellular eukaryotes such as animals and plants. Their complex multicellularity is inconsistent with the simpler forms typically expected 600 million years ago. This opens up a new door for us to shine some light on the timing and evolutionary steps that were taken by multicellular organisms that would eventually go on to dominate the Earth in a very visible way, said study co author Prof Shuhai Xiao of the Virginia Tech College of Science.

Ankylosauridae ankylosaurs, ankylosaurids is a family of plant eating dinosaurs with armored plates on their back. Ankylosaurs lived in what is now western North America, Europe and East Asia, between 122 and 66 million years ago. They were not only armored but were also heavily armed  they often had shoulder spikes and large bony clubs at the end of their tails. The newly discovered ankylosaur, named Ziapelta sanjuanensis, roamed what is today New Mexico during the so called Kirtlandian land vertebrate faunal age, 74.8 to 72.8 million years ago. Its fossilized skull and bones were uncovered from the Kirtland Formation at Hunter Wash, San Juan Basin, in northwestern New Mexico in 2011. An analysis of the fossils shows that Ziapelta sanjuanensis stands out from other ankylosaurs because of unusually tall spikes on the cervical half ring, a structure like a yoke of bone sitting over the neck. The skull also differentiates it from other known ankylosaurs. The horns on the back of the skull are thick and curve downwards, and the snout has a mixture of flat and bumpy scales  an unusual feature for an ankylosaurid. Theres also a distinctive large triangular scale on the snout, where many other ankylosaurids have a hexagonal scale, explained Dr Victoria Arbour from the University of Alberta, the lead author of the paper published in the journal PLoS ONE.

Sharks have been around for a long time, making them evolutionarily successful. Over millions of years of evolution, these marine monsters have developed a wide range of reproductive adaptations. The oviparous form of reproduction, or egg laying, is considered a primitive form and common for benthic, littoral, and bathyal sharks, about 40 percent of extant shark species. Oviparous sharks produce large yolky eggs, which are often encased in leathery shells with tendrils that anchor them to rocks or weeds. The well preserved 310 million year old shark egg case was found at a new fossil bearing Upper Carboniferous site near Doncaster, South Yorkshire, UK. The shark egg case is particularly rare and significant, because its soft bodied and an unusual object to find fossilized, said Dean Lomax, who is the first author of a paper published in the Geological Journal. Other finds at the site included Carboniferous plants, bivalves, arthropods, tentaculitids and fish scales.

The new hadrosaur, scientifically named Rhinorex condrupus, lived during the Cretaceous period, about 75 million years ago. It was about 9 meters long, weighed over 3,800 kg, and lived in a swampy estuarial environment, about 80 km from the coast. Weve found other hadrosaurs from the same time period but located about 320 km farther south that are adapted to a different environment, said Dr Gates, who is the first author of a paper describing Rhinorex condrupus in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. This discovery gives us a geographic snapshot of the Cretaceous, and helps us place contemporary species in their correct time and place. Rhinorex condrupus also helps us further fill in the hadrosaur family tree. Hadrosaurs are usually identified by bony crests that extended from the skull, but Rhinorex condrupus lacked a crest on the top of its head instead, it had a huge nose. Dr Gates explained the purpose of such a big nose is still a mystery. If this dinosaur is anything like its relatives then it likely did not have a super sense of smell but maybe the nose was used as a means of attracting mates, recognizing members of its species, or even as a large attachment for a plant smashing beak. Dr Gates and his co author, Dr Scheetz, came across its fossilized skull and bones in storage at Brigham Young University. First excavated in the 1990s, the fossils had been studied primarily for its well preserved skin impressions. When the paleontologists reconstructed its skull, they realized that they had a new hadrosaur species. We had almost the entire skull, which was wonderful, Dr Gates said.

About 66 million years ago, a 10 km asteroid crashed into our planet near the site of the small town of Chicxulub in Mexico. It left a crater more than 150 km across, and the resulting tsunami, wildfires, earthquakes and volcanism are widely accepted to have wiped out the dinosaurs and made way for the rise of the mammals. The new study, carried out by U.S. scientists led by Dr Brian Enquist of the University of Arizona, reveals that the cataclysmic Chicxulub impact also decimated the evergreen flowering plants to a much greater extent than their deciduous peers. The researchers were able to reconstruct the ecology of a diverse plant community thriving during a 2.2 million year period the last 1,400,000 years of the Cretaceous and the first 800,000 of the Paleogene spanning the Chicxulub impact. They found evidence that after the impact, deciduous angiosperms had replaced their slow growing, evergreen peers to a large extent. Living examples of evergreen angiosperms, such as holly and ivy, tend to prefer shade, dont grow very fast and sport dark colored leaves. While it was known that the plant species that existed before the impact were different from those that came after, data was sparse on whether the shift in plant assemblages was just a random phenomenon or a direct result of the event, said Benjamin Blonder, a researcher at the University of Arizona and the first author on the study. Our study provides evidence of a dramatic shift from slow growing plants to fast growing species. This tells us that the extinction was not random, and the way in which a plant acquires resources predicts how it can respond to a major disturbance. And potentially this also tells us why we find that modern forests are generally deciduous and not evergreen. Dr Enquist, Mr Blonder and their colleagues studied a total of about 1,000 fossilized plant leaves collected from the Hell Creek Formation in southern North Dakota. By analyzing leaves, which convert carbon dioxide into nutrients for the plant, they used a new approach that enabled them to predict how plant species used carbon and water, shedding light on the ecological strategies of plant communities long gone, hidden under sediments for many millions of years. We measured the mass of a given leaf in relation to its area, which tells us whether the leaf was a chunky, expensive one to make for the plant, or whether it was a more flimsy, cheap one, Dr Blonder said. In addition to the leaves mass per area ratio, the scientists measured the density of the leaves vein networks. By comparing the two parameters, we get an idea of resources invested versus resources returned, and that allows us to capture the ecological strategy of the plants we studied long after they went extinct.

The prehistoric animal, Jaggermeryx naida means Jaggers water nymph, belonged to Anthracotheriidae, a family of extinct hoofed animals related to hippopotamuses and whales. The team headed by Dr Safiya Hassan of Cairo University discovered several fossilized jaw fragments belonging to the animal at the early Miocene site of Wadi Moghra in the Egyptian desert. The fossils suggest it was the size of a regular deer and could be described as a cross between a long legged pig and a slender hippo. Geological data, combined with the fossils of Jaggermeryx naida, catfish, turtles, waterbirds and five other anthracothere species found at Wadi Moghra, suggest that millions of years ago the area was an estuary characterized by marsh and swamps. We imagine Jaggermeryx naidas lifestyle was like that of a water deer, standing in water and foraging for plants along the river bank, explained Dr Ellen Miller of Wake Forest University, a team member and the lead author of a paper published in the Journal of Paleontology. The animal was further distinguished from other anthracotheres by a series of eight holes on either side of its jaw that held nerves, giving it a supersensitive lower lip and snout. That would have helped it forage for plant foods along riverbanks. Some of my colleagues suggested naming the new species after Hollywood star Angelina Jolie, because she also has famous lips, Dr Miller said. But for me it had to be Mick.

Two specimens of the new pterosaur, Ikrandraco avatar means Ikran dragon from Avatar, were uncovered from the Jiufotang Formation in Chaoyang, Liaoning province, northeastern China. According to the paleontologists, Ikrandraco had a wingspan of about 2.5 meters. It possessed a throat pouch similar to that of a pelican and probably fed on small fish from freshwater lakes, flying low over the water and catching prey by skimming its lower jaw into the water, and may have stored the fish in the pouch. Ikrandraco didnt have a crest on the top of its elongated head as many pterosaurs did. Behind the lower jaw crest was a hook like structure that appears to have been the anchor point for the throat pouch, said Dr Alexander Kellner of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who is the senior author of a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports. The pterosaur had small teeth and boasted an unusual blade like crest on its lower jaw similar to that of dragons from the Avatar movie. It lived in a warm region teeming with life, with feathered dinosaurs, birds, mammals, frogs, turtles and other animals along with a variety of trees and other plants, said lead author Dr Xiaolin Wang of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, China.

The\u00a0remains also indicate that Spinosaurus aegyptiacus was the largest known predatory dinosaur to live on our planet, measuring about 3 meters longer than Tyrannosaurus rex. Dr Iurino and his colleagues found that Spinosaurus aegyptiacus developed a variety of previously unknown aquatic adaptations. These adaptations include   huge, slanted teeth that interlocked at the front of the snout the conical shape and location of the teeth were well suited for catching fish   neurovascular openings at the end of the snout similar openings on crocodile and alligator snouts contain pressure receptors that enable them to sense movement in water its likely these openings served a comparable function in Spinosaurus aegyptiacus   small nostrils located in the middle of the skull the small size and placement of the nostrils farther back on the skull allowed this dinosaur to breathe when part of its head was in water   a long neck and trunk that shifted the dinosaurs center of mass forward this made walking on two legs on land nearly impossible, but facilitated movement in water   powerful forelimbs with curved, blade like claws these claws were ideal for hooking or slicing slippery prey   strong, long boned feet and long, flat claws unlike other predators, Spinosaurus aegyptiacus had feet similar to some shorebirds that stand on or move across soft surfaces rather than perch   a small pelvis and short hind legs with muscular thighs as in the earliest whales, these adaptations were for paddling in water and differ markedly from other predatory dinosaurs that used two legs to move on land   loosely connected bones in the dinosaurs tail these bones enabled its tail to bend in a wave like fashion, similar to tails that help propel some bony fish   large dorsal spines covered in skin that created a gigantic sail on the Spinosaurus aegyptiacus back the tall, thin, blade shaped spines were anchored by muscles and composed of dense bone with few blood vessels this suggests the sail was meant for display and not to trap heat or store fat the sail would have been visible even when the animal entered the water   particularly dense bones lacking the marrow cavities typical to predatory dinosaurs similar adaptations, which enable buoyancy control, are seen in modern aquatic animals like king penguins. The paleontologists came to their conclusions after analyzing new fossils uncovered in the Moroccan Sahara and a partial skull and other remains housed in museum collections around the world as well as historical records and images from the first reported discovery of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus in Egypt in 1912.  The team CT scanned all of the new fossils to create a digital model of the dinosaurs skeleton. We relied upon cutting edge technology to examine, analyze and piece together a variety of fossils. For a project of this complexity, traditional methods wouldnt have been nearly as accurate, said Dr Simone Maganuco of the Museo di Storia Naturale di Milano, Italy, who is a co author of a paper describing the results in the journal Science. The team then used the digital model of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus to create an anatomically precise, life size replica of its skeleton. What surprised us even more than the dinosaurs size were its unusual proportions. We see limb proportions like this in early whales, not predatory dinosaurs, said co author Dr Paul Sereno of the University of Chicago.

The new species, named Huaridelphis raimondii, belongs to Squalodelphinidae, a rare extinct family of marine dolphins, which are related to the extant Ganges and Indus river dolphins. Though the squalodelphinids have been known for some time, these small to medium size dolphins are rare in the fossil record, and were until now only found in a few localities in Argentina, France, Italy, and east coast of the United States. Several well preserved skulls of Huaridelphis raimondii were uncovered from the Pisco Basin  a desert on the coast of Peru. The quality of the fossils places these specimens as some of the best preserved members of this rare family, said Dr Olivier Lambert of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, who is the lead author of a paper describing Huaridelphis raimondii in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. The Pisco Basin is currently one of the richest areas in the world for the study of the evolution of whales and other marine mammals whales with fossilized baleen, a giant raptorial sperm whale, and a walrus like dolphin have been discovered there. For the past 30 years, many fossil cetacean species were described based on material from the Pisco Basin, dated from the Eocene to the Pliocene.

The three new species, named Shenshou lui, Xianshou linglong, and Xianshou songae, are described from six nearly complete 160 million year old fossils. These animals were successful tree dwellers, weighing between 30 and 300 grams. They were good climbers and probably spent more time than squirrels in trees. Their hands and feet were adapted for holding branches, but not good for running on the ground, said Dr Meng, who is the senior author of a paper published in the journal Nature. They likely ate insects, nuts, and fruit with their strange teeth, which have many cusps on the crowns. Mammals are thought to evolve from a common ancestor that had three cusps human molars can have up to five. But the new squirrel like mammals had two parallel rows of cusps on each molar, with up to seven cusps on each side. The paleontologists have placed them in a new group of mammals, named Euharamiyida. Despite unusual tooth patterning, the overall morphology seen in the new fossils is mammalian. For example, the specimens show evidence of a typical mammalian middle ear, the area just inside the eardrum that turns vibrations in the air into ripples in the ears fluids. The middle ears of mammals are unique in that they have three bones, as evidenced in the new fossils. However, the placement of the new species within Mammalia poses another issue based on the age of the Euharamiyida species and their kin, the divergence of mammals from reptiles had to have happened much earlier than some research has estimated. Instead of originating in the middle Jurassic between 176 and 161 million years ago, mammals likely first appeared in the late Triassic between 235 and 201 million years ago.

The newly discovered dinosaur, named Rukwatitan bisepultus, belongs to Titanosauria, a diverse group of herbivorous dinosaurs known for their iconic large body sizes, long necks and wide stance. Although not among the largest of titanosaurians, the new species is estimated to have a forelimb reaching 2 meters and may have weighed as much as several elephants. Its fossil vertebrae, ribs, limbs and pelvic bones were uncovered in the Rukwa Rift Basin of southwestern Tanzania. CT scans of the fossils, combined with detailed comparisons with other titanosaurians, revealed unique features that suggested a creature that was different from previous finds  including those from elsewhere in Africa. Using both traditional and new computational approaches, we were able to place the new species within the family tree of sauropod dinosaurs, explained Eric Gorscak, a doctoral student of Ohio University and the lead author of a paper describing Rukwatitan bisepultus in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. The dinosaurs bones exhibit similarities with another titanosaurian dinosaur, Malawisaurus dixeyi, previously discovered in Malawi. But the two southern African dinosaurs are distinctly different from one another, and, most notably, from titanosaurians known from northern Africa, said co author Prof Patrick OConnor of the Ohio Universitys Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine. The discovery also contributes to fleshing out the global portrait of titanosaurian dinosaurs, which lived in habitats across the globe through the end of the Cretaceous. Their rise in diversity came in the wake of the decline of another group of sauropods, the diplodocoids. Paleontologists have found fossils for more than 30 titanosaurians in South America compared to just four in Africa.

It is the most complete giant titanosaur yet discovered, and provides new insight into the morphology and evolutionary history of these supermassive dinosaurs. Titanosaurs are a remarkable group of dinosaurs, with species ranging from the weight of a cow to the weight of a sperm whale. But the biggest titanosaurs have remained a mystery, because, in almost all cases, their fossils are very incomplete, said Dr Matthew Lamanna, a team member and a co author of a paper describing Dreadnoughtus schrani in the journal Scientific Reports. Dreadnoughtus schrani lived in temperate forests in what is now the south of South America during the Upper Cretaceous period, around 77 million years ago. At about 26 meters long and a mass of 59.3 tons, it is the largest land animal for which a body mass can be accurately calculated. Dreadnoughtus schrani was astoundingly huge. It weighed as much as a dozen African elephants or more than seven Tyrannosaurus rexes, said first author Dr Kenneth Lacovara of Drexel University. With a body the size of a house and a weaponized tail, it would have feared nothing, the scientist said. As a result, he chose the name Dreadnoughtus, meaning fears nothing. To grow as large as Dreadnoughtus schrani, a dinosaur would have to eat massive quantities of plants. An adult Dreadnoughtus schrani was likely too large to fear any predators, but it would have still been a target for scavengers after dying of natural causes or environmental disasters. During four field seasons from 2005 to 2009, Dr Lacovara, Dr Lamanna and their colleagues from the United States, the United Kingdom and Argentina have excavated a total of 145 bones and a single tooth representing two individuals of Dreadnoughtus schrani  115 bones and the tooth from the larger specimen and 30 bones from a second, smaller individual. The larger specimen is exceptionally complete, with over 70 percent of the bones, excluding the head, represented. This is far more complete than all previously discovered giant titanosaurian dinosaurs. To better visualize the skeletal structure of the new dinosaur, the paleontologists digitally scanned all of the bones from both specimens and made a virtual mount of the Dreadnoughtus schranis skeleton. The 3D laser scans show the deep, exquisitely preserved muscle attachment scars that can provide a wealth of information about the function and force of muscles that the dinosaur had and where they attached to the skeleton  information that is lacking in many sauropods. Efforts to understand Dreadnoughtus schranis body structure, growth rate, and biomechanics are ongoing areas of research within Dr Lacovaras lab.

According to the scientists, the newly discovered fossil, named Haootia quadriformis, provides the oldest evidence of muscle tissue  the bundles of cells that make movement in animals possible. They have interpreted it as a cnidarian, the group which contains modern animals such as corals, sea anemones and jellyfish. It differs from any previously described Ediacaran fossil 635 to 541 million years ago, as it comprises of bundles of fibers in a broadly four fold symmetrical arrangement a body plan that is similar to that seen in modern cnidarians. The evolution of muscular animals, in possession of muscle tissues that enabled them to precisely control their movements, paved the way for the exploration of a vast range of feeding strategies, environments, and ecological niches, allowing animals to become the dominant force in global ecosystems, explained Dr Liu, who is the first author of a paper describing Haootia quadriformis in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Historically, the origin, evolution and spread of animals has been viewed as having begun during the Cambrian Explosion, a period of rapid evolutionary development starting 541 million years ago when most major animal groups first appear in the fossil record. Dr Liu said however, in recent decades, discoveries of preserved trackways and chemical evidence in older rocks, as well as molecular comparisons, have indirectly suggested that animals may have a much earlier origin than previously thought. The problem is that although animals are now widely expected to have been present before the Cambrian Explosion, very few of the fossils found in older rocks possess features that can be used to convincingly identify them as animals. Instead, we study aspects of their ecology, feeding or reproduction, in order to understand what they might have been.

Azhdarchidae are the most successful and stratigraphically youngest group of pterosaurs. The name of the group is derived from the Persian word A\u017edarha meaning dragon. This group included some of the largest known flying animals of all times, with a wingspan up to 12 meters, such as those from the genus Quetzalcoatlus. Interestingly, Azhdarchids currently represent a real nightmare for scientists. Most species are known from few bones, which often do not overlap between named species, the few known skeletons are poorly preserved, and some of the best available material has remained undescribed for about 40 years. Despite these difficulties, the number of sites where Azhdarchid pterosaurs were found is impressive and reflects the important role these flying reptiles played in ecosystems of the Upper Cretaceous. Azhdarchids likely inhabited a variety of environments, but were abundant near large lakes and rivers and most common in nearshore marine paleoenvironments, said Dr Averianov, who is the author of a study published in the journal ZooKeys. The study is one of the most comprehensive attempts to review the taxonomy and geographic distribution of Azhdarchid pterosaurs.

Caiuajara dobruskii lived in what is today southern Brazil between 94 and 72 million years ago, in the Cretaceous period. This reptile was gregarious, living in colonies, and most likely precocial, being able to fly at a very young age. The fossil bones of Caiuajara dobruskii were collected from the Goio Er\u00ea Formation in the southern Brazils state of Paran\u00e1. They belonged to at least 47 individuals ranging from young to adult, with wing spans from 0.65 to 2.35 m. Several anatomical features show that Caiuajara dobruskii belongs to Tapejaridae, a clade of toothless pterodactyloid pterosaurs. According to a paper published in the journal PLoS ONE, Caiuajara dobruskii is the youngest member of Tapejaridae and the southernmost known occurrence of the clade. Several features of the Caiuajara dobruskii head differ from all other members of this clade, including the presence of a bony expansion projecting inside the large opening in the skull in front of the eyes, and the rounded depressions in the outer surface of the jaw, the paleontologists explained. Younger and older reptiles mainly varied in the size and angle of the bony crest on the top of the head. The crest appeared to change from small and inclined in juveniles, to large and steep in adults.

The newly discovered dinosaur, named Laquintasaura venezuelae, belongs to ornithischians bird hipped dinosaurs  a group which includes species such as Stegosaurus and Iguanodon. It is the first dinosaur found in the north of South America. Until now paleontologists had assumed that the region was uninhabited by dinosaurs as it was surrounded by large deserts. Fossil bones of at least four individuals of Laquintasaura venezuelae were recovered from the La Quinta Formation of the Venezuelan Andes. The species was about the size of a small dog, measuring about 1 m in length, and walked on two hind legs. It lived in small groups and was largely herbivorous. Long curved tips on some of its teeth suggest it might have also eaten insects or other small prey. Laquintasaura venezuelae lived very soon after the major extinction at the end of the Triassic Period, showing dinosaurs bounced back quickly after this event, said Dr Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum in London, UK, who is the first author of a paper published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. It is fascinating and unexpected to see they lived in herds, something we have little evidence of so far in dinosaurs from this time. The fact that it is from completely new and early taxon means we can fill some of the gaps in our understanding of when different groups of dinosaurs evolved. The early history of bird hipped dinosaurs is still very patchy as so few of them have been found, said senior author Prof Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Villagra of the University of Z\u00fcrich.

Birds out shrank and out evolved their dinosaurian ancestors, surviving where their larger, less evolvable relatives could not, said study lead author Dr Michael Lee of the University of Adelaide and South Australian Museum. Dr Darren Naish of the University of Southampton, UK, a co author on the study, added these bird ancestors also evolved new adaptations, such as feathers, wishbones and wings, four times faster than other dinosaurs. Dr Lee, Dr Naish and their colleagues examined 1,549 anatomical traits of dinosaurs to reconstruct their detailed family tree. It shows that the miniaturization of theropod dinosaurs started about 50 million years before the earliest known birds lived. The dinosaurs most closely related to birds are all small, and many of them  such as Microraptor  had some ability to climb and glide, said senior author Dr Gareth Dyke of the University of Southampton. Birds evolved through a unique phase of sustained miniaturization in dinosaurs. Being smaller and lighter in the land of giants, with rapidly evolving anatomical adaptations, provided these bird ancestors with new ecological opportunities, such as the ability to climb trees, glide and fly, Dr Lee said. Ultimately, this evolutionary flexibility helped birds survive the meteorite impact which killed off all their dinosaurian cousins.

There has long been intense scientific debate about the cause of the dinosaur extinction, said Dr Richard Butler from the University of Birmingham, who is a co author on the study. Although our research suggests that dinosaur communities were particularly vulnerable at the time the asteroid hit, there is nothing to suggest that dinosaurs were doomed to extinction. Without that asteroid, the dinosaurs would probably still be here, and we very probably would not. The dinosaurs were victims of colossal bad luck, added Dr Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh, the lead author on the study. Not only did a giant asteroid strike, but it happened at the worst possible time, when their ecosystems were vulnerable. Our new findings help clarify one of the enduring mysteries of science. Dr Brusatte and his colleagues studied an updated catalogue of dinosaur fossils, mostly from North America, to create a picture of how dinosaurs changed over the few million years before the asteroid hit. The team found that in the few million years before a large bolide comet or asteroid struck what is now Mexico, Earth was experiencing environmental upheaval. This included extensive volcanic activity, changing sea levels and varying temperatures. At this time, the dinosaurs food chain was weakened by a lack of diversity among the large herbivorous dinosaurs on which others preyed. This was probably because of changes in the environment and climate. This created a perfect storm of events in which non avian dinosaurs were vulnerable and unlikely to survive the aftermath of the asteroid strike. As food chains collapsed, this would have wiped out the dinosaur kingdom one species after another. The only dinosaurs to survive were those who could fly, which evolved to become the birds of today. The scientists said if the asteroid had struck a few million years earlier, when the range of dinosaur species was more diverse and food chains were more robust, or later, when new species had time to evolve, then they very likely would have survived.

Previously only carnivorous dinosaurs were known to have had feathers so this new species indicates that all dinosaurs could have been feathered. The new dinosaur, named Kulindadromeus zabaikalicus, was a small plant eater, only about 1 meter long. It had long hind legs and short arms, with five strong fingers. Its snout was short, and its teeth show clear adaptations to plant eating. In evolutionary terms, it sits low in the evolutionary tree of ornithischian dinosaurs. Six skulls and several hundred partial skeletons of Kulindadromeus zabaikalicus were recovered from the Kulinda fossil site  the lower part of the Ukurey Formation in eastern Siberia. According to a paper published in the journal Science, Kulindadromeus zabaikalicus had scales on its tail and shins, and short bristles on its head and back. It also had complex, compound feathers on its arms and legs. I was really amazed when I saw this, Dr Godefroit said. We knew that some of the plant eating ornithischian dinosaurs had simple bristles, and we couldnt be sure whether these were the same kinds of structures as bird and theropod feathers. Our new find clinches it all dinosaurs had feathers, or at least the potential to sprout feathers. These feathers are really very well preserved, added Dr Maria McNamara of University College Cork, a co author on the discovery. We can see each filament and how they are joined together at the base, making a compound structure of six or seven filaments, each up to 1.5 cm long. This discovery suggests that feather like structures were likely widespread in dinosaurs, possibly even in the earliest members of the group. Feathers probably arose during the Triassic, more than 220 million years ago, for insulation and signaling, and were only later used for flight. Smaller dinosaurs were probably covered in feathers, mostly with colorful patterns, and feathers may have been lost as dinosaurs grew up and became larger. Developmental experiments in modern chickens suggest that avian scales are aborted feathers, an idea that explains why birds have scaly legs, said co author Prof Danielle Dhouailly of the Universit\u00e9 Joseph Fourier in Grenoble, France. The astonishing discovery is that the molecular mechanisms needed for this switch might have been so clearly related to the appearance of the first feathers in the earliest dinosaurs.

Lyrarapax unguispinus Latin for spiny clawed lyre shaped predator belongs to Anomalocarididae abnormal shrimps, a group of early marine animals known from fossils found in Cambrian deposits in Australia, China, United States, Canada and Europe. The Lyrarapax fossil with well preserved traces of muscles, digestive tract and brain was unearthed in 2013 near Kunming in the Chinese province of Yunnan. Because its detailed morphology is exquisitely preserved, Lyrarapax unguispinus is amongst the most complete anomalocaridids known so far, said Dr Peiyun Cong of Yunnan University, China, who is the first author of a paper describing Lyrarapax unguispinus in the journal Nature. Over 12 cm long, Lyrarapax unguispinus was dwarfed by some of the larger anomalocaridids, which reached 1 meter in length. Paleontologists excavating lower Cambrian rocks in southern Australia found that some anomalocaridids had huge compound eyes, up to 10 times larger than the biggest dragonfly eye, befitting what must have been a highly efficient hunter, Dr Strausfeld said. Anomalocaridids were first discovered as fossils in the late 19th century but not properly identified until the early 1980s. They still have paleontologists arguing over where they belong in the tree of life. Our discovery helps to clarify this debate. It turns out the top predator of the Cambrian had a brain that was much less complex than that of some of its possible prey and that looked surprisingly similar to a modern group of rather modest worm like animals, Dr Strausfeld said. According to Dr Strausfeld and his colleagues, the brain in the Lyrarapax fossil suggests its relationship to a branch of animals whose living descendants are known as onychophorans velvet worms. These wormlike animals are equipped with stubby unjointed legs that end in a pair of tiny claws. Onychophorans, which are also exclusively predators, grow to no more than a few centimeters in length and are mostly found in the Southern Hemisphere, where they roam the undergrowth and leaf litter in search of beetles and other small insects, their preferred prey. The Lyrarapax fossil resembles the neuroanatomy of todays onychophorans in several ways. Onychophorans have a simple brain located in front of the mouth and a pair of ganglia  a collection of nerve cells  located in the front of the optic nerve and at the base of their long feelers. The similarities of their brains and other attributes suggest that the anomalocaridid predators could have been very distant relatives of todays velvet worms, Dr Strausfeld concluded.

The new dinosaur, named Changyuraptor yangi, belongs to Microraptoria  a specific group of predatory four winged raptorial dinosaurs. These dinosaurs are dubbed four winged because the long feathers attached to the legs have the appearance of a second set of wings. The long feathers attached to the legs and arms of these creatures have led some scientists to propose that the four winged dinosaurs were capable of flying. At 1.3 meter long, Changyuraptor yangi is the biggest of all four winged dinosaurs. Its well preserved fossil was unearthed in the Liaoning Province of northeastern China. According to a paper published in the journal Nature Communications, Changyuraptor yangi sported a full set of feathers cloaking its entire body, including the extra long tail feathers. At a foot in length, the amazing tail feathers of Changyuraptor yangi are by far the longest of any feathered dinosaur, said co author Dr Luis Chiappe from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The paleontologists believe that the discovery consolidates the notion that flight preceded the origin of birds, being inherited by the latter from their dinosaurian forerunners. Co author Dr Alan Turner of Stony Brook University said numerous features that we have long associated with birds in fact evolved in dinosaurs long before the first birds arrived on the scene. This includes things such as hollow bones, nesting behavior, feathers and possibly flight. How well these creatures used the sky as a thoroughfare has remained controversial. The new discovery explains the role that the tail feathers played during flight control. For larger flyers, safe landings are of particular importance. It makes sense that the largest microraptorines had especially large tail feathers  they would have needed the additional control, explained co author Dr Michael Habib from the University of Southern California.

Unearthed in Inner Mongolia in 2002, Scansoriopteryx was previously classified as a theropod dinosaur, from which many paleontologists believe flying dinosaurs and later birds evolved. However, according to a new study published in the Journal of Ornithology, Scansoriopteryx was a tree climbing animal that could glide. The studys authors, Dr Alan Feduccia from the University of North Carolina and Dr Stephen Czerkas of the Dinosaur Museum in Blanding, Utah, used advanced techniques to reveal structures in the Scansoriopteryx fossil not clearly visible before. The techniques made it possible to interpret the natural contours of the bones. Many aspects of the fossils pelvis, forelimbs, hind limbs, and tail were confirmed, while it was discovered that it had elongated tendons along its tail vertebrae similar to Velociraptor. Scansoriopteryx lacks the fundamental structural skeletal features to classify it as a dinosaur, the paleontologists said. Dinosaurs are not the primitive ancestors of birds. The Scansoriopteryx should rather be seen as an early bird whose ancestors are to be found among tree climbing archosaurs that lived in a time well before dinosaurs. Scansoriopteryx has numerous bird like features such as elongated forelimbs, wing and hind limb feathers, wing membranes in front of its elbow, half moon shaped wrist like bones, bird like perching feet, a tail with short anterior vertebrae, and claws that make tree climbing possible. The paleontologists identified the primitive elongated feathers on its forelimbs and hind limbs. This suggests that Scansoriopteryx is a basal or ancestral form of early birds that had mastered the basic aerodynamic maneuvers of parachuting or gliding from trees. The findings validate predictions that the ancestors of birds were small, tree dwelling archosaurs which enhanced their incipient ability to fly with feathers that enabled them to at least glide.

Dr Jason Dunlop of the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde in Berlin and Dr Russell Garwood of the University of Manchester used thin slices of rock showing the cross section of Palaeocharinus to work out the range of motion in its limbs. These fossils  from a rock called the Rhynie chert  are unusually well preserved, Dr Dunlop said. The scientists then used an open source computer graphic program called Blender to create the video showing the animals walking. When it comes to early life on land, long before our ancestors came out of the sea, these early arachnids were top dog of the food chain, said Dr Garwood, who is the first author of a paper published in the Journal of Paleontology. They are now extinct, but from about 300 to 400 million years ago, seem to have been more widespread than spiders.  Now we can use the tools of computer graphics to better understand and recreate how they might have moved  all from thin slivers of rock, showing the joints in their legs. Dr Dunlop added this new study has gone further and shows us how they probably walked.

Our planet has experienced many dramatic changes in climate since the dinosaurs went extinct around 66 million years ago. The warmest period was the early Eocene, 50 to 53 million years ago. During this interval, mammal communities in what is today Canada and the United States were quite distinct from those of today. Within Canada, the only other fossil localities yielding mammals of similar age are from the Arctic, so these fossils from British Columbia help fill a significant geographic gap, said Dr Natalia Rybczynski from the Canadian Museum of Nature, a co author of a paper reporting the discovery in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. The fossils of Silvacola acares, along with fossils of Heptodon sp., were recovered from a unique fossil site known as Driftwood Canyon Provincial Park that likely was a rainforest environment during the early Eocene. Most of the fossil bearing rocks at Driftwood Canyon were formed on the bottom of an ancient lake and are well known for their exceptionally well preserved leaves, insects, and fishes. But no fossils of mammals had ever before been identified at the site. The hedgehog Silvacola acares specific name means tiny forest dweller was only 5 to 6.5 cm long, roughly the length of an adult thumb. It is quite tiny and comparable in size to some of todays shrews, said Dr Jaelyn Eberle of the University of Colorado Boulder, the first author on the study. Silvacola acares may have fed on insects, plants and perhaps seeds. The other mammal discovered at the site, Heptodon sp., is an ancient relative of modern tapirs, which resemble small rhinos with no horns and a short, mobile trunk or proboscis. Dr Eberle said Heptodon sp. was about half the size of todays tapirs, and it lacked the short trunk that occurs on later species and their living cousins. Based upon its teeth, it was probably a leaf eater, which fits nicely with the rainforest environment indicated by the fossil plants at the site. The discovery in northern British Columbia of an early cousin to tapirs is intriguing because todays tapirs live in the tropics, she said. Its occurrence, alongside a diversity of fossil plants that indicates a rainforest, supports an idea put forward by others that tapirs and their extinct kin are good indicators of dense forests and high precipitation. Dr David Greenwood of Brandon University in Manitoba, who is the senior author of the study, said Driftwood Canyon is a window into a lost world  an evolutionary experiment where palms grew beneath spruce trees and the insects included a mixture of Canadian and Australian species. Discovering mammals allows us to paint a more complete picture of this lost world.

But despite this diverse Dino heritage, the UKs rich reptilian past has been somewhat neglected by the popular media and literature until now. The term Dinosauria, meaning terrible lizard, was conceived by the British paleontologist Sir Richard Owen almost 200 years ago for fossils found in England. Sadly, when most people are asked to name a dinosaur, the chances are they would give a foreign example, such as Tyrannosaurus rex, even though the British Isles was a veritable dinosaur paradise, Dean Lomax said. Many British dinosaur remains are known from fragmentary and isolated bones, though several complete to near complete skeletons have also been discovered. They include stegosaurs, ankylosaurs, ornithopods, gigantic sauropods  one of which is possibly the largest dinosaur found in Europe  and the carnivorous theropods, including at least three different types of tyrannosaurs. The three British tyrannosaurs would have resembled their cousin, Tyrannosaurus rex, but were smaller  3 5 meters in length  possessed longer forelimbs, were more agile and, geologically speaking, a lot older, Dean Lomax explained. Dinosaur remains in the British Isles are recorded from rocks within the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, although the majority of UK dinosaur remains come from Middle Jurassic and Early Cretaceous rocks. Most dinosaurs have been discovered in England  the majority around Oxfordshire and on the Isle of Wight  but some significant finds have also been made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The first ever dinosaur to be described was Megalosaurus, which was discovered in Oxfordshire and described in 1824. The new book, co authored by a physicist and talented artist Nobumichi Tamura, is more than 400 pages long and contains 800 plus images, including photographs of the actual fossils and scene reconstructions depicting how the animals may have appeared in life. There are also individual descriptions of each dinosaur species and details of the age and the discovery site where specimens were found. The book is aimed at a broad audience but also those with an academic interest. There is a foreword by leading British dinosaur paleontologist Dr Paul Barrett, of the Natural History Museum in London. Dean Lomax added I had long hoped for such a book. Growing up in Yorkshire I had always wanted to learn about the dinosaurs discovered here, yet all of the books I read, or programmes I watched on TV, made only passing comments to some of the remains discovered in the British Isles. The book covers every major dinosaur discovery in this country and lists all the locations where the remains have been found and are currently stored, including one of a kind species. I hope the book, which has involved collaboration with more than 40 institutions worldwide, will inspire and encourage a new wave of future paleontologists with a real passion for British dinosaurs.

Pelagornis sandersi could have traveled for extreme distances while crossing ocean waters in search of prey, explained Dr Ksepka, who reported the discovery in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Pelagornis sandersi belongs to Pelagornithidae, an extinct group of birds known for bony tooth like beak projections, large size, and highly modified wing bones. Pelagornithids were like creatures out of a fantasy novel  there is simply nothing like them around today. These giant birds occurred all over the globe for tens of millions of years, but vanished during the Pliocene, just three million years ago. Paleontologists remain uncertain about the cause of their demise, Dr Ksepka said. At 6.4 m, the wingspan of this bird was about two times that of the Royal Albatross Diomedea exulans, the largest living flying bird. This wingspan places Pelagornis sandersi above some theoretical upper limits for powered flight in animals, but nonetheless it is clear from the skeleton the bird was a masterful flyer. Dr Ksepka estimated the length of the feathers based on the relationship between bone lengths and feather lengths in living birds, and used computer models to infer that the bird was an efficient glider. Now in the collections at the Charleston Museum, the fossilized remains of Pelagornis sandersi  its skull and substantial postcranial material  were recovered from the Chandler Bridge Formation in South Carolina by Museum volunteer James Malcom in 1983. The specific name, sandersi, honors retired Charleston Museum curator Albert Sanders, collector of the fossil.

This tracksite occurs in the Upper Cretaceous Cantwell Formation in the Alaska Range and it is the largest tracksite known from this far north, Dr Kobayashi and his co authors wrote in a paper published in the journal Geology. The discovery of the Denali tracksite shows that hadrosaurs  large, duck billed, plant eating dinosaurs  not only lived in multi generational herds but thrived in the ancient high latitude, polar ecosystem. Preservation of the tracksite is exceptional  most tracks, regardless of size, contain skin impressions and co occur with well preserved plant fossils and traces of land and water insects. Denali is one of the best dinosaur footprint localities in the world, said Dr Anthony Fiorillo from Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Texas, who is the first author of the paper. What we found was incredible  so many tracks, so big and well preserved. Dr Fiorillo added many had skin impressions, so we could see what the bottom of their feet looked like. There were many invertebrate traces  imprints of bugs, worms, larvae and more  which were important because they showed an ecosystem existed during the warm parts of the years. Statistical analysis of the tracks also shows that individuals of four different age classes of hadrosaurids lived together in a large social group.

The specimen shows that the entire body of Archaeopteryx was covered in pennaceous feathers. Birds arose during the Jurassic from small feathered dinosaurs. They were not alone in the skies, which were dominated by pterosaurs. Archaeopteryx is regarded as the first known bird. It was a small creature with primitive traits like teeth and a long bony tail. Since its first discovery in the 1860s, Archaeopteryx has been the object of many debates in relation to bird evolution, especially flight and feather evolution. There were debates if it was ground dwelling or arboreal, if it could fly or not, said Dr Rauhut, who is the senior author of a paper published in the journal Nature. Some scientists had suggested the vanes of its feathers were too weak to support flight, but the new fossil backs the idea Archaeopteryx was completely capable of flying. It retains its status as the original bird, added first author Dr Christian Foth, also of the Ludwig Maximilians Universit\u00e4t. The new specimen of Archaeopteryx belongs to the private collection of Dr Burkhard Pohl from the Wyoming Dinosaur Center at Thermopolis, Wyoming. Unfortunately, we have no exact dates about when and in which quarry the new specimen of Archaeopteryx was found. However, it can be said with certainty that this specimen is from the Solnhofen Formation, the paleontologists explained. The fossil shows that contour feathers basic vaned, quill like feathers of Archaeopteryx covered its entire body up to the head as in modern birds. For the first time, it has become possible to examine the detailed structure of the feathers on the body, the tail and, above all, on the legs, Dr Rauhut said. The shafts of the wing feathers of Archaeopteryx were comparable in strength to those of modern birds. And the plumage of the hindlimbs looked like that of modern birds of prey like falcons and eagles. The feathers on its legs were quite long but were restricted to the thigh and shank, looking like feather trousers. They may have been used for display and to stabilize flight during landing, the scientists explained.

Mr Scannella and his colleagues recorded the stratigraphic information for more than 50 Triceratops skulls recovered from the Hell Creek Formation in Montana and analyzed their morphology. Most dinosaurs are only known from one or a handful of specimens. Some dinosaurs are known from a large number of specimens, but theyre often found all in one place  on a single stratigraphic horizon. The great thing about Triceratops is that there are a lot of them, and they were found at different levels of the Hell Creek Formation, explained Mr Scannella, who is the first author of a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. So we can compare Triceratops found at different levels. When you have a larger sample size, you can learn much more about variation, growth and evolution. Paleontologists previously discovered that the skull and horns of Triceratops changed shape as it grew from a baby to an adult. In 2010, Mr Scannella with colleagues suggested that the skull of Triceratops underwent an even more dramatic transformation than had been suspected and that when fully mature, the Triceratops became what had previously been thought to be a distinct genus of horned dinosaur, the Torosaurus. The new study finds evidence that not only did Triceratops change shape over the lifetime of an individual, but that the genus transformed over the course of the end of the age of dinosaurs, Mr Scannella said. Over two million years at the end of the Cretaceous period, Triceratops went from having a small nasal horn and long beak to having a long nasal horn and shorter beak. The dinosaur with a small nasal horn and long beak is a Triceratops horridus. It was only found lower in the Hell Creek Formation. The dinosaur with a long nasal horn and shorter beak is a Triceratops prorsus. It was only found near the top of the formation. Skulls found in the middle of the formation showed characteristics of both Triceratops horridus and Triceratops prorsus. The paleontologists also found that Triceratops is the most common dinosaur in the Hell Creek Formation.

The study, published in the journal Geology, indicates that these Eocene sharks were thriving in the brackish water of the western Arctic Ocean. In contrast, modern sand tiger sharks living today in the Atlantic Ocean are very intolerant of low salinity, requiring three times the saltiness of the Eocene sharks in order to survive. This study shows the Arctic Ocean was very brackish and had reduced salinity back then. The ancient sand tiger sharks that lived in the Arctic during the Eocene were very different than sand tiger sharks living in the Atlantic Ocean today, said lead author Dr Sora Kim of the University of Chicago. The new findings on Arctic Ocean salinity conditions in the Eocene were calculated in part by comparing ratios of oxygen isotopes locked in ancient shark teeth found in sediments on Banks Island in the Arctic Circle and incorporating the data into a salinity model. Dr Kims team also compared its information to prior studies of sediment cores extracted from an oceanic region in the central Arctic Ocean called the Lomonosov Ridge  a steep hump of continental crust that rises more than 300 meters from the ocean floor  to estimate past environmental conditions in the Arctic Ocean. Oxygen isotopes in ancient bones and teeth reflect the water animals are living in or drinking. Because sharks are aquatic, the oxygen from the ocean is constantly being exchanged with oxygen in their body water, and thats what is incorporated into their teeth. When I analyzed their isotopic composition, the numbers seemed weird at first because they indicated an essentially freshwater environment, Dr Kim said. The scientists analyzed 30 fossil sand tiger shark teeth collected from Banks Island and 19 modern sand tiger shark teeth from specimens caught in Delaware Bay bordered by Delaware and New Jersey. The paleo salinity estimate for the modern sand tiger sharks is consistent with the continental shelf salinity present from Delaware south to Florida and from the coastline to roughly 10 km offshore, known hunting grounds for modern sand tiger sharks, which have formidable teeth and can reach a length of nearly 3 meters. We now know a fair amount about the terrestrial animals and plants that were living in the Eocene Arctic greenhouse period. To finally get some data on the Eocene marine environment using these shark teeth will help us to begin filling in the gaps, concluded study co author Dr Jaelyn Eberle of the University of Colorado.

This unusual parasite, named Qiyia jurassica, represents a stem group of the tabanomorph family Athericidae. The generic name, Qiyia, is from the Chinese qiyi meaning bizarre. The specific name, jurassica, refers to the Jurassic age of the species. Five fossilized individuals of Qiyia jurassica were recovered from the Middle Jurassic Daohugou beds, near Ningcheng, China. All specimens are carbonaceous impressions on the surface of grey tuffaceous siltstone. The parasite was 2  2.5 cm long, had a gigantic sucking plate and caterpillar like legs. In the fresh water habitat, it crawled onto passing salamanders, attached itself with its sucking plate, and penetrated the thin skin of the amphibians in order to suck blood from them. The parasite lived the life of Reilly. This is because there were many salamanders in the lakes, as fossil finds at the same location near Ningcheng in Inner Mongolia have shown, said Prof Jes Rust from the University of Bonns Steinmann Institute for Geology, Mineralogy and Palaeontology, who is the senior author of the discovery paper published in the journal eLIFE. Dr Bo Wang from the University of Bonn, a co author of the discovery, added there scientists had also found around 300,000 diverse and exceptionally preserved fossil insects. No insect exists today with a comparable body shape. That the bizarre larva from the Jurassic has remained so well preserved to the present day is partly due to the fine grained mudstone in which the animals were embedded. The finer the sediment, the better the details are reproduced in the fossils. The conditions in the groundwater also prevented decomposition by bacteria, said co author Dr Torsten Wappler from the University of Bonns Steinmann Institute for Geology, Mineralogy and Palaeontology.

For the last 2.5 million years, Earth has experienced cold and warm, millennia long cycles that collectively have become known as the Ice Age. During cold periods, continental scale ice sheets blanketed large tracts of the northern hemisphere. As the climate warmed up, these colossal glaciers receded. The advance and retreat of the ice sheets also had a profound influence in the evolution and geographic distribution of many animals, including those that live today in the Arctic regions. Previously, paleontologists described a great number of extinct, cold adapted species  of a wooly rhino Coelodonta thibetana, three toed horse Hipparion, Tibetan bharal Pseudois, known as blue sheep, chiru Pantholops, known as Tibetan antelope, snow leopard Uncia, badger Meles, and 23 other mammals  that lived in what is now the Tibetan Plateau during the Pliocene and Pleistocene 5 million to 11,500 years ago. This year, they discovered another Tibetan mammal  a 5 to 3 million year old fox, Vulpes qiuzhudingi, which was the likely ancestor of the living Arctic fox Vulpes lagopus. The origin of the Arctic fox and other cold adapted mammals has usually been sought either in the Arctic tundra or in the cool steppes elsewhere. But the discovery of Vulpes qiuzhudingi boosts an alternative scenario, which scientists call the out of Tibet hypothesis. It argues that some of the Ice Age megafauna used ancient Tibet as a training ground for developing adaptations that allowed them to cope with the severe climatic conditions. There are a lot of challenges, but in paleontological terms, it is a relatively unexplored environment.

The new dinosaur, named Mercuriceratops gemini, has been described from skull fossils of two individuals recovered from the Judith River Formation, north central Montana, the United States, and the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta, Canada. The generic name, Mercuriceratops, means Mercury horned face, referring to the wing like ornamentation on its head that resembles the wings on the helmet of the Roman god, Mercury. The specific name refers to the almost identical twin specimens of this dinosaur found in the United States and Canada. Mercuriceratops was about 6 m long and weighed more than 2,000 kg. It had two long brow horns above eyes and a parrot like beak. Horned dinosaurs in North America used their elaborate skull ornamentation to identify each other and to attract mates  not just for protection from predators, said Dr Michael Ryan from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, the first author of a paper published in the journal Naturwissenschaften. The wing like protrusions on the sides of its frill may have offered male Mercuriceratops a competitive advantage in attracting mates. Dr David Evans, a paleontologist with the Royal Ontario Museum and a co author on the paper, added Mercuriceratops shows that evolution gave rise to much greater variation in horned dinosaur headgear than we had previously suspected. The butterfly shaped frill, or neck shield, of Mercuriceratops is unlike anything we have seen before. This discovery of a previously unknown species in relatively well studied rocks underscores that we still have many more new species of dinosaurs to left to find, said paper co author Dr Mark Loewen of the Natural History Museum of Utah.

Megamastax amblyodus was a primitive lobe finned fish Sarcopterygii. The paleontologists think it measured up to 1 m in length and had 17 cm long jaws. Its always been thought that Silurian fish were all small because, until now, no fossils of species more than 30 cm or so in length have ever been discovered. But from the site in Yunnan, near the city of Qujing, we uncovered a diverse collection of jawed fish from Silurian sediments, including the new Megamastax, a predator vastly larger than any other vertebrate known from this age, explained Dr Choo, who, along with colleagues, reported the discovery in the journal Scientific Reports. Three fossil specimens of this prehistoric fish were unearthed from the Silurian Kuanti Formation about 423 million years ago of Yunnan, China. The discovery of Megamastax amblyodus refutes the long held belief that large predatory fish did not emerge until much later in the Devonian period 410 to 360 million years ago. The discovery adds a new twist on our understanding of the ancient atmosphere, Dr Choo added. As modern large fish tend to be more sensitive to oxygen availability than smaller ones, the apparent absence of big Silurian fishes has been used to calibrate some models of Earths atmospheric history, with supposedly lower oxygen levels restricting body size prior to the Devonian. However, evidence of a 1 m long fish swimming about 423 million years ago strongly refutes the idea, he said. While by themselves, these fossils do not give an exact indication of what the atmosphere was like in the Silurian, they are still a significant new piece of the puzzle that will be incorporated into further research. The discovery of Megamastax amblyodus indicates that much of the earliest chapter of vertebrate evolution remains to be uncovered.

Fish fossils from the Cambrian period are very rare and usually poorly preserved. Previously, only two incomplete specimens of Metaspriggina walcotti had been identified. About 44 well preserved specimens of this prehistoric species were collected from the famous Burgess Shale Formation in British Columbia in 2012. Paleontologists Prof Simon Morris of the University of Cambridge and Dr Jean Bernard Caron from the University of Toronto and Royal Ontario Museum used these fossils, along with several more specimens from the eastern United States, to reclassify Metaspriggina walcotti as one of the first vertebrates. The details in the fossils are stunning. Even the eyes are beautifully preserved and clearly evident, said Prof Conway Morris, who is the first author of a paper published in the journal Nature. The fossils, which date from 505 million years ago, also show pairs of exceptionally well preserved arches near the front of the fishs body. These arches have long been known to have played a key role in the evolution of vertebrates, including the origin of jaws, and some of the tiny bones in the ear which transmit sound in mammals. Until now, however, a lack of quality fossils has meant that the arrangement of these arches in the first vertebrates had been hypothetical. The first of these pairs, closest to the head of Metaspriggina walcotti, eventually led to the evolution of jaws in vertebrates, according to the paleontologists. The arrangement of the muscles shows Metaspriggina walcotti were active swimmers, not unlike a trout, and the animals saw the world through a pair of large eyes and sensed their surrounding environment with nasal structures.

New Study Tries to Answer Longstanding Question", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jun 13, 2014", "doc": "Dinosaurs fit in between warm blooded mammals and cold blooded reptiles, according to a study reported in the journal Science. The study is the first to explore the relationship between growth rate and metabolic rates in animals and extend that to long extinct animals such as dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus rex. Dinosaurs dominated the landscape for more than 100 million years, but all that remains today are bones. This has made it difficult to solve a puzzle were they cold blooded or warm blooded creatures? To answer this question, a team of scientists led by Prof Felisa Smith from the University of New Mexico developed and used an extensive database of animal growth and energy use. The researchers demonstrated that animals which grow faster, not only require more energy, but have higher body temperatures. Then, using growth estimates made by paleontologists for extinct dinosaurs, they calculated dinosaur metabolic rates. The result was unexpected dinosaurs were clearly intermediate between modern mammals and reptiles. Most dinosaurs were probably mesothermic, a thermally intermediate strategy that only a few species \u00ad such as egg laying echidnas or great white sharks  use today, said study first author John Grady of the University of New Mexico. The team also found that feathered dinosaurs and primitive birds grew distinctly slower than their descendants, modern birds. Archaeopteryx, the first bird took two years to reach maturity. But, a red tailed hawk, which is about the same size, only takes 6 weeks. While dinosaurs didnt grow as fast as modern birds or mammals, they did grow significantly faster than modern reptiles, Mr Grady explained. This higher energy use probably increased speed and performance. Mesothermic dinosaurs were likely faster predators or better able to flee from danger than the large reptiles found earlier in during the Mesozoic. Dinosaurs quickly became the new ecological incumbents. Mesothermy in dinosaurs may have helped them become ecologically dominant and probably also helped them become enormous.

The discovery reveals that the pterosaurs lived together in gregarious colonies. The pterosaur fossil record is generally poor, with little information about their populations. To date, only four isolated and flattened pterosaur eggs were known to the paleontological science. Discovered in 2005 in the Turpan Hami Basin, northwestern China, the new pterosaur fossil rich site harbors thousands of bones, including male and female skulls and the first three dimensional eggs. It was most exciting to find many male and female pterosaurs and their eggs preserved together. Five eggs are three dimensionally preserved, and some are really complete, said Dr Xiaolin Wang from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, who is the lead author of a paper published in the journal Current Biology. Sediments in the area suggest that the colony died in a large storm in the Early Cretaceous period, about 120 million years ago. Dr Wangs team decided that the fossils belong to a previously unknown genus and species of pterosaur  Hamipterus tianshanensis. The generic name, Hamipterus, is a combination of a reference to the region where the specimens were found and the Greek word pteros wing. The specific name, tianshanensis, refers to the Tian Shan Mountains in Xinjiang, China. The paleontologists also examined the well preserved pterosaur eggs to find that they were pliable, with a thin, calcareous eggshell outside and a soft, thick membrane inside, similar to the eggs of some modern day snakes. Their analysis of 40 pterosaur individuals suggests differences between the sexes in the size, shape, and robustness of their head crests. The combination of many pterosaurs and eggs strongly indicates the presence of a nesting site nearby and indicates that this species developed gregarious behavior. Hamipterus tianshanensis most likely buried their eggs in sand along the shore of an ancient lake to prevent them from drying out. While the new fossils shed light on the reproductive strategy, development, and behavior of pterosaurs, there is still plenty left to learn about them.

The newly discovered prehistoric monster has been named Anthracosuchus balrogus. The specific epithet, balrogus, derives from the Balrog, the name of a ferocious fictional creature that appeared in J.R.R. Tolkiens novel The Lord of the Rings and dwelled deep in the middle Earth Mines of Moria. Anthracosuchus balrogus belongs to Dyrosauridae, a family of now extinct crocodyliforms that lived from Late Cretaceous to the Eocene. Originating in Africa, these crocodile like reptiles swam across the Atlantic Ocean to South America about 75 million year ago. The family somehow survived the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs and persisted to become a top predator. Four specimens of Anthracosuchus balrogus were unearthed in the Cerrejon coal mine, northern Colombia. It quickly became clear that the four fossil specimens were unlike any dyrosaur species ever found, said Dr Alex Hastings from Martin Luther Universit\u00e4t Halle Wittenberg, who is the lead author of a paper published in the journal Historical Biology. The crocodyliforms that lived in the Cerrejon ecosystem during the Paleocene, when temperatures were higher than today, thrived and grew to enormous sizes. This group offers clues as to how animals survive extinctions and other catastrophes. As we face climates that are warmer today, it is important to understand how animals responded in the past. This family of crocodyliforms in Cerrejon adapted and did very well despite incredible obstacles, which could speak to the ability of living crocodiles to adapt and overcome, Dr Hastings said. Anthracosuchus balrogus was about 5 meters long, weighed 410 kg, and had an unusually blunt snout for species in the dyrosaurids family. The species short snout paired with large jaw muscles typical of dyrosaurids, would give it an incredibly powerful bite, Dr Hastings said. It lived in freshwater rivers alongside the famous giant Titanoboa snake measured up to 18 meters long, ate turtles and fish. We couldnt believe it had such a boxy, short skull and that it was still a dyrosaur. It really busts the mold for these animals. It is such a completely different looking beast than weve seen for these crocodile like animals, said co author Dr Jonathan Bloch of Florida Museum. The study of dyrosaurids in Cerrejon is providing a better understanding of the early history of crocodiles in the Neotropics, concluded senior author Dr Carlos Jaramillo of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.

These specimens were discovered in the vicinity of the Tyndall Glacier in the Torres del Paine National Park. They were assigned to four different species of Ophthalmosauridae including the early Cretaceous ichthyosaur Platypterygius hauthali. Preservation of the specimens is excellent and occasionally includes soft tissue and embryos. The skeletons are associated with ammonites, belemnites, inoceramid bivalves, and fishes as well as numerous plant remains. Their description appears in the Geological Society of America Bulletin. The enormous concentration of ichthyosaurs is unique for Chile and South America and places the Tyndall locality among the prime fossil Lagerst\u00e4tten for Early Cretaceous marine reptiles worldwide, the scientists said. The deposit is Early Cretaceous in age about 146 million years ago and forms part of a deep water sequence located in the Rocas Verdes Basin, a straight separating Antarctica and South America from Late Jurassic to late Early Cretaceous times. The Tyndall ichthyosaurs were gregarious and likely hunted in packs in a submarine canyon near the east coast of this sea. Their potential prey, belemnites and small fishes, were abundant due to plankton blooms caused by cold water upwelling. Occasionally, high energy turbiditic mudflows sucked down everything in their reach, including ichthyosaurs. Inside the suspension flows, the air breathing reptiles lost orientation and finally drowned. They were instantly buried in the abyss at the bottom of the canyon, the researchers explained.

Baltic amber is a fossilized tree resin found on or near the shores of the eastern Baltic Sea. It is exceptionally rich in well preserved inclusions of botanical and zoological objects, particularly arthropods. The new bug species was found trapped in a 45 million year old honey colored, transparent piece of Baltic amber. It belongs to Aradus, a genus of true bugs in the family Aradidae. Extant species of Aradus commonly live on and under the bark of dead trees, which could be an explanation why so many species are well preserved in amber deposits. Until now 14 species of the genus were described from Baltic amber. The new species has been named Aradus macrosomus. The specific name comes from the Greek words macros large and soma body, referring to unusual large size of the bug. The description of Aradus macrosomus appears in the open access journal Deutsche Entomologische Zeitschrift.

There were no swans, no swallows, no herons, nothing like that, explained Jonathan Mitchell, a PhD student at the University of Chicago and the first author of a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. They were pretty much all between a sparrow and a crow. Mitchell and his co author, Peter Makovicky from the Field Museum of Natural History, examined the diversity of species in the Cretaceous Jehol Biota, dating back to about 125 million years ago  relatively soon after the emergence of birds. Because bird fossils indicate only the physical characteristics of the birds, understanding the diversity in how the birds behaved required significant scientific legwork. To tease out the ecological roles played by the prehistoric birds, the team used modern day birds to build a statistical technique that could relate the physical characteristics of a bird to its diet, behavior and habitat. Long legs might be associated with birds that wade through water, for instance, and the shape of the beak might hint at what the bird ate. For this purpose, Mitchell and Makovicky measured 1,400 modern birds  mostly from the Field Museums collections  and extracted the correlations between these measurements and the birds behavior. However, they still had to show that this technique, which was useful for modern birds, could be applied effectively to the distinct sample of ancient birds. These birds are very different from modern birds  some of them have teeth, some of them have long bony tails, Mitchell said. In order to test the method, the scientists looked at the contents of the birds stomachs, which in some cases had survived the process of fossilization. They found agreement between the methods predictions and the birdss diet, indicating that it worked for ancient birds as well. Once they had confirmed that the method was effective for the fossil birds with food preserved in their bellies, the scientists applied their method to the full complement of the regions bird fossils. They found that these early birds were less diverse than modern birds. In particular, larger birds and water birds were lacking. They were all pretty much the same. They were ground dwelling or forest dwelling little birds, mostly eating insects and seeds, Mitchell explained. The results have implications for when and how birds originated  a topic under some debate. In a broader sense, I think that our research speaks to an understanding of how groups of organisms, which are perhaps dominant today in modern ecosystems, get to that point, Makovicky said. Birds, for example, evolved from humble beginnings into the diverse group we know today. The early bird, therefore, may indeed have gotten the worm  or the insect or seed  but not much else.

In the United States, Europe and Asia, ticks are a more important insect vector of disease than mosquitos. They can carry bacteria that cause a wide range of diseases, affect many different animal species, and often are not even understood or recognized by doctors, said Prof George Poinar, Jr., a paleoentomologist with the Oregon State Universitys College of Science and the author of a paper published in the journal Historical Biology. Its likely that many ailments in human history for which doctors had no explanation have been caused by tick borne disease. Lyme disease is a perfect example. It can cause problems with joints, the heart and central nervous system, but researchers didnt even know it existed until 1975. But the discovery of an ancient Borrelia like bacterium, Palaeoborrelia dominicana, shows these problems with tick borne disease have been around for millions of years. Prof Poinar found spirochetes like cells of Palaeoborrelia dominicana in a series of four ticks Amblyomma sp. preserved in 15 million year old amber from the Dominican Republic. This is the oldest fossil evidence of ticks associated with such bacteria. Ticks and the bacteria they carry are very opportunistic. They are very efficient at maintaining populations of microbes in their tissues, and can infect mammals, birds, reptiles and other animals, he said. In 30 years of studying diseases revealed in the fossil record, the scientist has documented the ancient presence of such diseases as malaria, leishmania, and others. Evidence suggests that even dinosaurs could have been infected with Rickettsial like bacteria  microorganisms that can cause various types of spotted fever. Humans have probably been getting diseases, including Lyme disease, from tick borne bacteria as long as there have been humans, Dr Poinar concluded.

Dakosaurus maximus measured up to about 4.5 m long and belonged to a family of marine animals known as thalattosuchians. The unusual shape of the animals skull and teeth suggests it ate similar prey to modern day killer whales. The animal would have used its broad, short jaws to swallow large fish whole and to bite chunks from larger prey. A huge, about 5.5 cm long, tooth of Dakosaurus maximus was collected from Kimmeridge Clay Formation in Dorset, England. It is the largest known British specimen of the genus Dakosaurus. The circumstances in which the fossil was found were unusual  it was dredged from the sea floor rather than being found on the shore or dug up, said Dr Young, who is the lead author of a paper published in the journal Historical Biology. Given its size, Dakosaurus had very large teeth. However, it wasnt the top marine predator of its time, and would have swum alongside other larger marine reptiles, making the shallow seas of the Late Jurassic period exceptionally dangerous.

Fossil evidence for the existence of pollinating insects dates back to the Cretaceous period. Until now, however, there had been no information at what time pollination through vertebrates, and birds in particular, came into existence. There have been occasional hints, such as characteristic bill shapes, that nectarivorous birds occurred in the past, but, so far, there existed no conclusive evidence, said Dr Gerald Mayr, a scientist with the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt and the first author of a paper published in the journal Biology Letters. To date, the oldest fossil record of an avian pollinator came from the early Oligocene, about 30 million years ago. But that fossil only offered indirect evidence of the existence of nectarivorous birds. Thanks to the excellent state of the newly discovered Pumiliornis fossil, we were able to identify two different types of pollen, which is the first conclusive proof of nectarivory, Dr Mayr said. The fossil of Pumiliornis tessellatus was unearthed at the Messel Pit, a site on the eastern side of the Rhine Rift Valley in Hesse, Germany. This is another discovery that underlines the unique significance of the Messel fossil site. The presence of pollen not only offers direct evidence of the birds feeding habits, but shows that birds already visited flowers as long as 47 million years ago, said Dr Volker Wilde, a paleobotanist at the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt and the second author of the paper. This spectacular discovery also suggests another conclusion. If a pollinating bird lived as much as 47 million years ago, it must be assumed that some representatives of the flora at that time had already adapted to this mode of pollination. To date, there were no fossil plants from this geological era that offer proof of the existence of ornithophily  i.e., the pollination of flowers through birds, Dr Wilde said.

This long necked herbivorous creature has been named Leinkupal laticauda. The generic name, Leinkupal, is derived from the Mapudungun the language of the Mapuche Native American nation that inhabits northwestern Patagonia words lein vanishing and kupal family. The species name, laticauda, is derived from the Latin words lati wide and cauda tail, referring to the dinosaurs broad tail evidenced by the lateral extension of the transverse processes in proximal caudal vertebrae. Leinkupal laticauda belongs to the family Diplodocidae, a group of sauropod dinosaurs recorded in late Jurassic strata from North America, Europe, Africa, and well known for their large bodies, as well as extremely long necks and tails. According to a paper published in the open access journal PLoS ONE, Leinkupal laticauda is the first diplodocid discovered in South America, the second confirmed diplodocid for the ancient continent Gondwana and the youngest record of Diplodocidae in the world. Its fossil bones were found in Bajada Colorada Formation of Neuqu\u00e9n Province in Patagonia, Argentina. Though the bones are fragmentary, Dr Gallina and his colleagues found differences between Leinkupal laticauda and other diplodocid species from North American and Africa in the vertebrae where the tail connects to the body. The paleontologists estimate that Leinkupal laticauda could reach 9 meters long. Since Leinkupal laticauda apparently lived much later than its North American and African cousins, its existence suggests that the supposed extinction of the Diplodocidae around the end of the Jurassic or beginning of the Cretaceous period didnt occur globally, but that the clade survived in South America at least during part of the Early Cretaceous, they said.

This yet to be named animal is one of the smallest species reported in Sparassodonta, an extinct order of carnivorous metatherian mammals native to South America. Once considered to be true marsupials, these animals are now thought to be a sister taxon to them. Its partial skull was unearthed at an unnamed formation of the Honda Group, Quebrada Honda local fauna, Bolivia. The paleontologists refrained from naming the animal because the skull lacks well preserved teeth, which are the only parts preserved in many of its close relatives. The skull, which would have been a little less than 8 cm long if complete, shows the animal had a very short snout. A socket, or alveolus, in the upper jaw shows it had large, canines, that were round in cross section much like those of a meat eating marsupial, called the Spotted tailed quoll, found in Australia today, said Dr Darin Croft and Mr Russell Engelman, authors of the paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Although sparassodonts are more closely related to modern opossums than cats and dogs, the group included saber toothed species that fed on large prey. The new Bolivian sparassodont probably fed on the ancient relatives of todays guinea pigs and spiny rats. The animal would have been about the size of a marten, a catlike weasel found in the Northeastern United States and Canada, and probably filled the same ecological niche, Mr Engelman explained. Most predators dont go after animals of equal size, but these features indicate this small predator was a formidable hunter, Dr Croft said. "}, {"title": " New Research Sheds Light on Dinosaur Bone Healing", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "May 7, 2014", "doc": "Paleontologists led by Dr Phil Manning of the University of Manchester have used a highly sensitive synchrotron imaging technique to reveal ancient injuries of a 150 million year old dinosaur, Allosaurus fragilis, and detect chemicals associated with the healing of its bones. Bones can absorb a wide range of elements and are therefore an important sink in the body for trace elements like cooper, strontium and zinc. These trace elements are found in elevated levels round sites where bones are repairing and can sometimes indicate where bones have broken and been mended during an animals lifetime. How bones heal and how fast they do it is dependent on physiological factors like metabolism, nutrition and immune response. By so examining the chemical makeup of ancient dinosaur bones the paleontologists hope to shed some light on how dinosaurs compare to their existing relatives. Recent studies have shown that the chemical makeup, and not just the impressions of soft tissues, can be preserved in fossils. Dr Mannings team suggests that if soft tissues can preserve these trace elements then it is likely that the fossilized remains of harder tissues like bone might also retain some of these chemical clues to the healing processes of ancient creatures like dinosaurs. The scientists used a technique called the synchrotron rapid scanning X ray fluorescence to analyze the chemicals lurking in the bones of Allosaurus fragilis. Using synchrotron imaging, we were able to detect astoundingly dilute traces of chemical signatures that reveal not only the difference between normal and healed bone, but also how the damaged bone healed, said Dr Manning, who is the senior author of the paper published online in the Royal Society journal Interface. It seems dinosaurs evolved a splendid suite of defense mechanisms to help regulate the healing and repair of injuries. The chemistry of life leaves clues throughout our bodies in the course of our lives that can help us diagnose, treat and heal a multitude of modern day ailments. Its remarkable that the very same chemistry that initiates the healing of bone in humans also seems to have followed a similar pathway in dinosaurs. Bone does not form scar tissue, like a scratch to your skin, so the body has to completely reform new bone following the same stages that occurred as the skeleton grew in the first place. This means we are able to tease out the chemistry of bone development through such pathological studies, explained study lead author Dr Jennifer Anne, also from the University of Manchester. Its exciting to realize how little we know about bone, even after hundreds of years of research. The fact that information on how our own skeleton works can be explored using a 150 million year old dinosaur just shows how interlaced science can be.

Qianzhousaurus sinensis belonged to the same family as Tyrannosaurus rex  Tyrannosauridae. Although the dinosaur lived alongside deep snouted tyrannosaurs, it would not have been in direct competition with them, as they probably hunted different prey. According to the scientists, Qianzhousaurus sinensis measured about 9 m from snout to tail, and had an elongated skull, long teeth compared with the deeper, more powerful jaws and thick teeth of a conventional Tyrannosaurus. This is a different breed of tyrannosaur, said Dr Steve Brusatte from the University of Edinburghs School of GeoSciences, a co author of the paper published in the journal Nature Communications. It has the familiar toothy grin of Tyrannosaurus rex, but its snout was much longer and it had a row of horns on its nose. It might have looked a little comical, but it would have been as deadly as any other tyrannosaur, and maybe even a little faster and stealthier. A near complete skull fossil of Qianzhousaurus sinensis was unearthed at the 72 66 million year old site in Ganzhou, southern China. The new discovery is very important. Along with Alioramus from Mongolia, it shows that the long snouted tyrannosaurids were widely distributed in Asia. Although we are only starting to learn about them, the long snouted tyrannosaurs were apparently one of the main groups of predatory dinosaurs in Asia, said lead author Prof Junchang L\u00fc from the Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, China. Following the discovery, the paleontologists have created a new branch of the tyrannosaur family for specimens with very long snouts, and they expect more dinosaurs to be added to the group as excavations in Asia continue to identify new species.

This creature lived in what is today northwest China around the time of the Middle Upper Jurassic boundary, about 163 million years ago. The reptile, named Kryptodrakon progenitor, is the first pterosaur to bear the characteristics of Pterodactyloidea, a highly specialized clade that includes the largest flying organisms. The generic name, Kryptodrakon, comes from Krypto hidden and drakon serpent, referring to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon filmed near where the species was discovered. The specific name, progenitor ancestral or first born, refers to its status as the earliest pterodactyloid. The fossil fragments of Kryptodrakon progenitor were collected from a mudstone of the Shishugou Formation in 2001 by Chris Sloan, formerly of National Geographic and now President of Science Visualization. They were found about 35 m below an ash bed that has been dated back to more than 161 million years. This area was likely a flood plain at the time the pterosaur lived, said Dr Brian Andres from the University of South Florida, the lead author of the study published in the journal Current Biology. According to the study, Kryptodrakon progenitor was a small flying reptile with a wingspan of about 1.4 m. Through studying its fragmentary remains, the paleontologists also determined that the pterodactyloids originated, lived, and evolved in terrestrial environments  rather than marine environments where other specimens have been found. Kryptodrakon progenitor fills in a very important gap in the history of pterosaurs. With him, they could walk and fly in whole new ways, Dr Andres said. Dr James Clark from the George Washington Universitys Columbian College of Arts and Sciences, a co author of the study, added Kryptodrakon progenitor is the second pterosaur species weve discovered in the Shishugou Formation and deepens our understanding of this unusually diverse Jurassic ecosystem. It is rare for small, delicate fossils to be preserved in Jurassic terrestrial deposits, and the Shishugou fauna is giving us a glimpse of what was living alongside the behemoths like Mamenchisaurus. The scientists said this new take on the ecological history of pterosaurs is supported by a significant correlation found between wing shape and environment in pterosaurs and modern flying vertebrates, like bats and birds. Pterosaurs, however, are not the ancestors of birds  those are the dinosaurs  and scientists still believe that pterosaurs did not evolve into birds or other modern animals humans would know.

Assassin flies are named for their fierce predation strategy  they ambush and catch their prey in flight. Once caught, the flies puncture the armor like skeleton of their prey, inject them with digestive fluids and extract the nutrients within. For more than 100 million years, these creatures have ruled the world of insects as a top predator. The lineages of these flies were previously only studied in limestone fossils dating back to 112 million years. The transparency of these amber fossils gives researchers a new window into the ecology of the Cretaceous period, and sheds light on the evolutionary history of a family of flies that has withstood the test of time for millions of years. The fossils of these ancient flies are so well preserved that you can almost imagine them flying around in our world today, explained Dr Torsten Dikow from the Smithsonian Institutions National Museum of Natural History, the first author of the paper published in the American Museum Novitates. The new species of assassin fly from the Cretaceous period has been named Burmapogon bruckschi. Dr Dikow and his co author, Dr David Grimaldi from the American Museum of Natural History, identified it after studying the morphology of a male and female specimen using a microscope. Distinct features that are not found in modern species of assassin flies include long, flattened antennae, a unique v shaped eye structure and spiny hind legs. While contemporary species of assassin flies can reach a length of more than 5 cm, Burmapogon bruckschi was less than 2.5 cm long and had bristles covering its slender, piercing mouthparts. The female Burmapogon bruckschi contained small spines on its abdomen, leading the paleontologists to hypothesize that these insects are most closely related to other assassin fly species that use these spines to dig and deposit their eggs in sandy environments. Since Burmapogon bruckschi likely did not spend much time in an arboreal habitat, it is extremely rare to find them in amber, the fossilized resin of ancient forests. Other fly species depend on forests for their life cycle and are therefore more frequently found encased in amber.

The evolution of herbivory was revolutionary to life on land because it meant terrestrial vertebrates could directly access the vast resources provided by terrestrial plants. These herbivores in turn became a major food resource for large land predators, explained Prof Robert Reisz, the first author of the paper published in the open access journal PLoS ONE. A partial skull and postcranial skeleton of a juvenile Eocasea martini were collected by Dr Larry Martin from the Dyke Museum of Natural History University of Kansas, at Hamilton Quarry near Hamilton, Greenwood County, Kansas. Eocasea martini was about 20 cm long and weighed less than 2 kg as an adult. It belonged to the caseid branch of Synapsida, a group representing an ancient lineage leading by stages to the mammals. The genus name, Eocasea, refers to the fact that this is the oldest known member of the clade. The species name, martini, honors Dr Larry Martin, the original collector of the specimen. Eocasea martini is one of the oldest relatives of modern mammals and closes a gap of about 20 million years to the next youngest members of the caseid family. This shows that caseid synapsids were much more ancient than previously documented in the fossil record, said second author Dr J\u00f6rg Fr\u00f6bisch from the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde and Humboldt University in Berlin. Eocasea martini is also the most primitive member and was carnivorous, feeding on insects and other small animals. Younger members were herbivorous, clear evidence that large terrestrial herbivores evolved from the groups small, non herbivorous members, such as Eocasea martini, Prof Reisz said. Eocasea martini is the first animal to start the process that has resulted in a terrestrial ecosystem with many plant eaters supporting fewer and fewer top predators. The paleontologists also found that herbivory was established not just in the lineage that includes Eocasea martini. It arose independently at least 5 times, including twice in reptiles. When the ability to feed on plants occurred after Eocasea martini, it seems as though a threshold was passed. Multiple groups kept re evolving the same herbivorous traits, Prof Reisz said. The five groups developed the novel ability to live off plants in staggered bursts with synapsids such as Eocasea martini preceding reptiles by nearly 30 million years. This shows that herbivory as a feeding strategy evolved first among distant relatives of mammals, instead of ancient reptiles  the branch that eventually gave rise to dinosaurs, birds, and modern reptiles. When Prof Reisz and Dr Fr\u00f6bisch mapped the animals on an evolutionary tree, they found that 4 of the groups showed a tremendous increase in size during the Permian Period. Caseids were the most extreme example of this size increase. The oldest member of the group, Eocasea martini, was very small, while the youngest, last member exceeded 500 kg. Prof Reisz said that the discovery of\u00a0Eocasea martini creates questions even as it answers them. One of the great mysteries to my mind is why did herbivory not happen before and why did it happen independently in several lineages? Thats whats fascinating about this event. Its the first such occurrence, and it resulted in a colossal change in our terrestrial ecosystem.

The analysis of its fossilized skull shows that living sharks are actually quite advanced in evolutionary terms, despite having retained their basic sharkiness over millions of years. Sharks are traditionally thought to be one of the most primitive surviving jawed vertebrates. And most textbooks in schools today say that the internal jaw structures of modern sharks should look very similar to those in primitive shark like fishes. But weve found thats not the case. The modern shark condition is very specialized, very derived, and not primitive, said Dr Alan Pradel, who is the lead author of the study published in the journal Nature. The well preserved shark fossil has been found by Ohio University scientists in Arkansas, where an ocean basin once was home to a diverse marine ecosystem, and described as the new species, Ozarcus mapesae. The heads of all fishes  sharks included  are segmented into the jaws and a series of arches that support the jaw and the gills. These arches are thought to have given rise to jaws early in the tree of life. Because shark skeletons are made of cartilage, not bone, their fossils are very fragile and are usually found in flattened fragments, making it impossible to study the shape of these internal structures. But the Ozarcus mapesae specimen was preserved in a nearly 3D state, giving the paleontologists a rare glimpse at the organization of the arches in a prehistoric animal. This beautiful fossil offers one of the first complete looks at all of the gill arches and associated structures in an early shark. There are other shark fossils like this in existence, but this is the oldest one in which you can see everything. Theres enough depth in this fossil to allow us to scan it and digitally dissect out the cartilage skeleton, said study co author Dr John Maisey. The team imaged the Ozarcus mapesae fossil with high resolution X rays to get a detailed view of each individual arch shape and organization. We discovered that the arrangement of the arches is not like anything youd see in a modern shark or shark like fish. Instead, the arrangement is fundamentally the same as bony fishes, Dr Pradel said. Its not unexpected that sharks  which have existed for about 420 million years  would undergo evolution of these structures. But the new work, especially when considered alongside other recent developments about early jawed vertebrates, has significant implications for the future of evolutionary studies of this group. Dr Maisey added bony fishes might have more to tell us about our first jawed ancestors than do living sharks.

Over the last two decades, huge numbers of fossils have been collected from the western Liaoning Province and adjacent parts of northeastern China, including exceptionally preserved feathered dinosaurs, early birds, and mammals. Most of these specimens are from the Cretaceous Period, including the famous Jehol Biota. However, in recent years many fossils have emerged from sites that are 30 million years earlier, providing an exceptional window on life during the Jurassic period, about 160 million years ago. The new study shows that several of these Jurassic sites are linked together by shared species and can be recognized as representing a single fossil fauna and flora  the Daohugou Biota. It contains superbly preserved specimens of a diverse group of amphibian, mammal, and reptile species. The Daohugou Biota dates from a time when many important vertebrate groups, including our own group, mammals, were undergoing evolutionary diversification. It makes a contribution to our understanding of vertebrate evolution during this period, with such notable creatures as the oldest known gliding mammal, another early mammal that may have swum with a beaver like tail, the oldest dinosaurs preserved with feathers, and a pterosaur that represents an important transitional form between two major groups. The Daohugou Biota gives us a look at a rarely glimpsed side of the Middle to Late Jurassic  not a parade of galumphing giants, but an assemblage of quirky little creatures like feathered dinosaurs, pterosaurs with advanced heads on primitive bodies, and the Mesozoic equivalent of a flying squirrel, said lead author Dr Corwin Sullivan from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, China. Almost more impressive than the diversity of the biota is the preservation of many of the vertebrate specimens, including complete or nearly complete skeletons associated with preserved soft tissues such as feathers, fur, skin or even, in some of the salamanders, external gills. The Daohugou amphibians are crucially important in the study of the phylogeny and early radiation of modern amphibian groups, said co author Dr Yuan Wang, also from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology. Daohugou is proving to be one of the key sites for understanding the evolution of feathered dinosaurs, early mammals, and flying reptiles, due largely to the fantastic levels of preservation. Many of the fossils are stunning and offer vast amounts of information. There are only a handful of similar sites elsewhere in the world and this article represents the first comprehensive attempt to draw all of the relevant information together into a single benchmark paper, said Dr Paul Barrett from the Natural History Museum, London, who was not involved with the study. Because the Daohugou Biota and the much better studied Jehol Biota are similar in preservational mode and geographic location, but separated by tens of millions of years, they give paleontologists an outstanding, even unique, opportunity to study changes in the fauna of this region over a significant span of geological time and an important period in vertebrate evolution. The Cretaceous feathered dinosaurs of northeastern China have been astonishing paleontologists and the public for almost two decades now, and the Daohugou Biota preserves their Jurassic counterparts in the same region. As prequels go, its pretty exciting, Dr Sullivan said.

Living harvestmen Opiliones  a group of arachnids more commonly known as daddy longlegs  have a single pair of eyes that help them navigate habitats in every continent except Antarctica. But the newly discovered Carboniferous fossil of a primitive harvestman named Hastocularis argus shows that wasnt always the case. Paleontologists from the United States and United Kingdom used X ray imaging techniques to reveal features of the unusually well preserved fossil like never before. Harvestmen fossils preserved in three dimensions are quite rare and our X ray techniques have allowed us to reveal this exceptional fossil in more detail than we would have dreamed possible just a couple of decades ago, said Dr Russell Garwood from the University of Manchester, the lead author of the paper appearing in the journal Current Biology. Terrestrial arthropods like harvestmen have a sparse fossil record because their exoskeletons dont preserve well. As a result, some fundamental questions in the evolutionary history of these organisms remain unresolved. This exceptional fossil has given us a rare and detailed look at the anatomy of harvestmen that lived hundreds of millions of years ago, explained study co author Dr Prashant Sharma from the American Museum of Natural History. The Hastocularis argus fossil was unearthed in France and had not only median eyes  those found near the centre of the body  but lateral eyes on the side of the body as well. Although they have eight legs, harvestmen are not spiders they are more closely related to another arachnid, the scorpion. Arachnids can have both median and lateral eyes, but modern harvestmen only possess a single set of median eyes  and no lateral ones, Dr Garwood said. These findings represent a significant leap in our understanding of the evolution of this group. The scientists corroborated their results by looking at the expression of a particular eye stalk growing gene in a living species of harvestmen. They found that developing embryos briefly express this gene in the lateral area, where the second eye pair is located in the fossil. But by the time they hatch, harvestmen only form the median eyes.

During the Cambrian period the face of our planet changed forever and there are still many unanswered questions, said Prof Buatois, who is the first author of the paper published in the journal Nature Communications. I think that our work is showing that the Cambrian was unique in that it witnessed the appearance of modern group of animals, but at the same time the ecology remained similar to that of the Ediacaran for several million years. At Fortune Head in eastern Newfoundland, Canada, Prof Buatois with co authors studied microbially induced sedimentary structures and Ediacaran type trace fossils formed during the transition between the Ediacaran and earlier Cambrian periods. Their findings imply that the disappearance of the Ediacaran biota represents an abrupt evolutionary event that corresponded with the appearance of modern animals, rather than a fading away due to the gradual elimination of conditions appropriate for Ediacaran preservation. The Cambrian period was a time of dramatic biological and sedimentary changes that ultimately led to the development of our modern world. Prior to the Cambrian, most marine sediments were covered by microbial mats that were host for the bizarre, soft bodied creatures of the Ediacaran biota. One prevalent hypothesis argues that this fauna did not actually go extinct at the beginning of the Cambrian, but instead that conditions for preserving the delicate impressions of Ediacaran soft bodied organisms disappeared with the arrival of burrowing in the Cambrian, and the loss of elements that were instrumental in their preservation as fossils. Discoveries like this are so important because they are at the core of our understanding of early evolutionary breakthroughs, Prof Buatois said.

Commonly known as the Dicksons thylacine, Nimbacinus dicksoni was a 50 cm long fox sized thylacine and a distant relative of the famous Tasmanian tiger Thylacinus cynocephalus. Paleontologists have recently discovered a 16 to 11 million year old skull of Nimbacinus dicksoni at the Riversleigh World Heritage fossil site in northwestern Queensland, Australia. They used the fossil to determine if this marsupial was more likely to hunt small or large prey. The scientists applied virtual 3D reconstruction techniques and computer modeling to reconstruct the skull, digitally crash testing and comparing it to models of large living marsupial carnivores  Tasmanian devil, spotted tailed quoll and northern quoll, and to the recently extinct Tasmanian tiger. They found that the similarity in mechanical performance of the skull between Nimbacinus dicksoni and the largest quoll, the spotted tailed quoll, was greater than the similarity to the Tasmanian tiger. The authors suggest that Nimbacinus dicksoni had a high bite force for its size and was likely capable of hunting vertebrate prey that exceeded its own body mass. Our findings suggest that Nimbacinus dicksoni was an opportunistic hunter, with potential prey including birds, frogs, lizards and snakes, as well as a wide range of marsupials, said Dr Marie Attard from the University of New England, who is the first author of a paper published in the journal PLoS ONE. In contrast, the iconic Tasmanian tiger was considerably more specialized than large living dasyurids and Nimbacinus, and was likely more restricted in the range of prey it could hunt, making it more vulnerable to extinction.

The fossil belongs to Fuxianhuia protensa, an extinct arthropod that lived in what is today Yunnan province in China during the Cambrian period, about 520 million years ago. This is the first preserved vascular system that we know of, said Prof Nicholas Strausfeld from the University of Arizona, who is the senior author of a paper published in the journal Nature Communications. Earlier, Prof Strausfeld helped identify the oldest known fossilized brain in a different specimen of Fuxianhuia protensa. In fact, the vascular system of Fuxianhuia protensa is more complex than what is found in many modern crustaceans. Fuxianhuia protensa is relatively abundant, but only extremely few specimens provide evidence of even a small part of an organ system, not even to speak of an entire organ system. The animal looks simple, but its internal organization is quite elaborate. For example, the brain received many arteries, a pattern that appears very much like a modern crustacean, Prof Strausfeld said. Different groups of crustaceans have vascular systems that have evolved into a variety of arrangements but they all refer back to what we see in Fuxianhuia protensa. Prof Strausfeld added over the course of evolution, certain segments of the animals body became specialized for certain things, while others became less important and, correspondingly, certain parts of the vascular system became less elaborate. In addition to the exquisitely preserved heart and blood vessels, the Fuxianhuia protensa fossil also features the eyes, antennae and external morphology of the animal. Using an innovative imaging technique, the paleontologists were able to identify the heart, which extended along the main part of the body, and its many lateral arteries corresponding to each segment. Its arteries were composed of carbon rich deposits and gave rise to long channels, which presumably took blood to limbs and other organs. With that, we can now start speculating about behavior. Because of well supplied blood vessels to its brain, we can assume this was a very active animal capable of making many different behavioral choices, Prof Strausfeld concluded.

Atlantochelys mortoni lived in what is now North America during the upper Cretaceous period, about 75 million years ago. The prehistoric creature was about 3 m 10 feet from tip to tail, making it one of the largest sea turtles ever known. It may have resembled modern loggerhead turtles, but was much larger than any sea turtle species alive today. For more than 160 years, only a partial humerus of Atlantochelys mortoni was known, but the second part of the same bone was discovered in 2012 by amateur paleontologist Gregory Harpel. A team of paleontologists headed by Dr Ted Daeschler of Drexel University immediately recognized the fossil as a humerus  the large upper arm bone  from a turtle, but its shaft was broken so that only the distal end, or end nearest to the elbow, remained. They also thought the fossil looked extremely familiar. They joked that perhaps it was the missing half of a different large, partial turtle limb housed in the collections at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University. That bone also had a broken shaft, but only its proximal end, nearest to the shoulder, remained. The coincidence was striking. I didnt think there was any chance in the world they would actually fit, said team member Dr Jason Schein from the New Jersey State Museum. There was no reason to think a lost half of the same old bone would survive, intact and exposed, in a New Jersey streambed from at least the time of the old bones first scientific description in 1849, until Harpel found it in 2012. The older bone was also without a match of any kind, making a perfect match seem even more farfetched. It was originally named and described by famed 19th century naturalist Louis Agassiz as the first, or type specimen, of its genus and species. In the intervening years, it remained the only known fossil specimen from that genus and species. Sure enough, you have two halves of the same bone, the same individual of this giant sea turtle. One half was collected at least 162 years before the other half, Dr Daeschler said. Now, the scientists are revising their conventional wisdom to say that, sometimes, exposed fossils can survive longer than previously thought. The astounding confluence of events that had to have happened for this to be true is just unbelievable, and probably completely unprecedented in paleontology, Dr Schein said. The fully assembled humerus of Atlantochelys mortoni now gives the scientists more information about the massive sea turtle it came from as well. The scientists believe that the entire unbroken bone was originally embedded in sediment during the Cretaceous period, 70 to 75 million years ago, when the turtle lived. Then those sediments eroded and the bone fractured millions of years later during the Pleistocene or Holocene, before the bone pieces became embedded in sediments and protected from further deterioration for perhaps a few thousand more years until their discovery. The description of the newly discovered fossil bone of Atlantochelys mortoni appears in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Daeschler T et al.

Many insects have developed defense mechanisms, including the ability to mimic the surrounding environment. Stick and leaf insects Phasmatodea mimic plants from their environment. Fossil species that can be conclusively identified as stem relatives of stick  and leaf insects are extremely rare. The fossil stick insect Cretophasmomima melanogramma has been described on the basis of one female and two male specimens collected from the early Cretaceous of the Jehol locality in Inner Mongolia, China. Cretophasmomima melanogramma possessed adaptive features that make it resembling a plant recovered from the same locality. Its wings have parallel dark lines and when in the resting position, likely produced a tongue like shape concealing the abdomen. Fossils from the gymnosperm plant Membranifolia admirabilis have been documented in the area with similar tongue shaped leaves along with multiple longitudinal lines. Dr Wang and colleagues said the insect used this plant as a model for concealment. The new fossils indicate that leaf mimicry was a defensive strategy performed by some insects as early as in the early Cretaceous, but that additional refinements characteristic of recent forms, such as a curved part of the fore legs for hiding the head, were still lacking, said the authors, who reported their findings in the journal PLoS ONE. They suggest that leaf mimicry predated the appearance of twig and bark mimicry in these types of insects. The diversification of small sized, insect eating birds and mammals may have triggered the acquisition of such primary defenses.

The new fossil creature that resembled a cross between a modern emu and a reptile was described from three specimens that collectively preserve almost the entire skeleton, giving paleontologists an opportunity to study the anatomy and evolutionary relationships of a mysterious group of theropod dinosaurs known as caenagnathids. The specimens were excavated from the uppermost level of the Hell Creek rock formation in North and South Dakota  a formation known for abundant fossils of Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops. Two of the specimens display evidence of pathology. One appears to have a broken and healed rib, and the other has evidence of some sort of trauma to a toe, said Dr Emma Schachner from the University of Utah, who is a co author of the paper published in the open access journal PLoS ONE. At 3.3 m 11 feet long and 1.5 m 5 feet tall at the hip, the dinosaur would have resembled a gigantic flightless bird, more than a typical theropod dinosaur such as Tyrannosaurus rex. It weighed an estimated 200 to 300 kg 440 to 660 pounds. Its jaws were tipped with a toothless beak, and its head sported a tall, rounded crest similar to that of a cassowary. It was a giant raptor, but with a chicken like head and presumably feathers. The animal stood about 11 feet tall, so it would be scary as well as absurd to encounter, Dr Schachner said. The beaked dinosaur has been scientifically named Anzu wyliei. The genus name is after a bird like demon in Mesopotamian mythology, and the specific name is after a boy named Wylie, the dinosaur loving grandson of a Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh trustee. With large sharp claws, Anzu wyliei was an omnivore, eating vegetation, small animals and perhaps eggs while living on a wet floodplain. The dinosaur apparently got into some scrapes. I am really excited about this discovery because\u00a0Anzu wyliei is the largest oviraptorosaur found in North America, Dr Schachner said. Oviraptorosaurs are a group of dinosaurs that are closely related to birds and often have strange, cassowary like crests on their heads. They are widely known because the first fossil skeleton, described in 1924, was found atop a nest of dinosaur eggs, suggesting that the creature had died in the act of raiding the nest. This thinking prevailed until the 1990s, when the same type of egg was found with a baby oviraptorid inside, demonstrating that, rather than a nest plunderer, Oviraptor was a caring parent that perished while protecting its eggs. More than a dozen oviraptorid species have been discovered, all in Mongolia and China, and many are known from beautifully preserved, complete or nearly complete skeletons. Additionally, beginning in the 1990s, several small, primitive relatives of oviraptorids were unearthed in much older, about 125 million year old rocks in northeastern China. Many of these are also represented by complete skulls or skeletons, some of which preserve fossilized feathers. Paleontologists have established that caenagnathids, oviraptorids, and these more archaic Chinese species are closely related to one another, and have united them as the theropod group Oviraptorosauria. The occurrence of oviraptorosaurs in both Asia and North America was not a surprise to paleontologists, because these continents were frequently connected during the Mesozoic Era, allowing dinosaurs and other land animals to roam between them. However, because their fossils were so incomplete, caenagnathids remained the most poorly known members of Oviraptorosauria, and indeed, one of the least understood of all major dinosaur groups. For almost a hundred years, the presence of oviraptosaurs in North America was only known from a few bits of skeleton, and the details of their appearance and biology remained a mystery, explained study co author Dr Hans Dieter Sues from the Smithsonian Institutions National Museum of Natural History in Washington. With the discovery of Anzu wyliei, we finally have the fossil evidence to show what this species looked like and how it is related to other dinosaurs.

The prehistoric marine animal, named Semirostrum ceruttii, is related to living crown porpoises. The generic name Semirostrum refers to the animals unusual jaw  the rostrum is the lower half of the jaw. The species name honors Dr Richard Cerutti, a paleontologist at the San Diego Natural History Museum. Semirostrum ceruttii had an extension of its jaw called a symphysis  the analogue of the human chin  that measured 85 cm. The typical symphysis of a crown porpoise measures only 1 2 cm. The extinct porpoise is a bizarre new animal, with the mandible extending well beyond the beak like snout, which it may have used for probing and skimming in the substrate, said Dr Racicot, who is the first author of a paper published in the journal Current Biology. Although this morphology has been recorded in birds and fish, this is the first described mammal with this anatomy. Semirostrum ceruttii is known from about 15 fossil specimens, all from California, including a remarkably well preserved specimen found at a construction site in San Diego. Dr Racicot and her collaborators analyzed original fossils and CT scans of the best preserved specimen, which they describe as almost completely preserved. The CT scans revealed extensive nerve canals leading from the symphysis into the rear of the skull, indicating that the protuberance was highly sensitive and could relay meaningful information to the animals brain. Further study showed that the porpoises optic canals were smaller than those in modern porpoise species as well, suggesting that the extinct animal also had poor eyesight. The paleontologists said Semirostrum ceruttii depended on its very sensitive lower jaw, together with its echolocation abilities, to find prey. Semirostrum ceruttii was in some ways similar to todays freshwater river dolphins.  Today we dont find anything resembling river dolphins in the same kinds of habitats that Semirostrum likely occupied. The porpoise lineage may have become more specialized over evolutionary time, Dr Racicot said. The discovery is a forerunner of many yet to come as digital 3D imaging revolutionizes the nondestructive study of museum specimens. Many exciting new species awaiting description are lying in museum collections, but the sort of detailed descriptions that are required to do full justice to them often take a lot of time.

Large carnivorous dinosaurs known as tyrannosaurs were dominant land predators in Asia and western North America during Cretaceous. The known diversity of this group has dramatically increased in recent decades with new finds, but overall understanding of their ecology and evolution is based almost entirely on fossils from southern Canada and central Asia. The partial skull roof, maxilla, and jaw of a previously unknown tyrannosaur were unearthed from the earliest Late Maastrichtian of the Prince Creek Formation on Alaskas North Slope. The new dinosaur, scientifically named Nanuqsaurus hoglundi, is a close relative of two famous tyrannosaurs  Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. The genus name, Nanuqsaurus, is combination of the I\u00f1upiaq word nanuq polar bear and the Greek sauros lizard. The specifc name, hoglundi, honors the Texas philanthropist Forrest Hoglund, for his career in earth sciences and his philanthropic efforts in furthering cultural institutions. According to a study published in the open access journal PLoS ONE, Nanuqsaurus hoglundi was relatively small with an adult skull about 64 cm long, compared to 1.5 meters for Tyrannosaurus rex. The tyrannosaur inhabited a seasonally extreme, high latitude continental environment on the northernmost edge of what is today North America. The study authors, Dr Anthony Fiorillo and Dr Ronald Tykoski, said the smaller body size of Nanuqsaurus hoglundi compared to most tyrannosaurs may reflect an adaptation to variability in resources in the Arctic. Further diversification may stem from the dinosaurs partial isolation in the north by land barriers, such as the east west running Brooks Range. The pygmy tyrannosaur alone is really cool because it tells us something about what the environment was like in the ancient Arctic, Dr Fiorillo said. But what makes this discovery even more exciting is that Nanuqsaurus hoglundi also tells us about the biological richness of the ancient polar world during a time when the Earth was very warm compared to today. Although Nanuqsaurus hoglundi fossils are fragments, Dr Fiorillo and his colleague point to morphological data to provide support for its place among derived tyrannosaurines.

Named Torvosaurus gurneyi in honor of the paleoartist James Gurney  creator of the utopic world of Dinotopia, the newly discovered prehistoric creature is the largest land predator known from Europe and one of the biggest predatory dinosaurs from the Jurassic period. According to a study published in the open access journal PLoS ONE, fossilized bones of this dinosaur were unearthed from the Lourinha Formation near Lisbon, Portugal. They were originally believed to be Torvosaurus tanneri, a dinosaur species that lived in what is now North America during Jurassic, 153 to 148 million years ago. But closer comparison of the shin bone, upper jawbone, teeth, and partial tail vertebrae suggest to the paleontologists that it may be a previously unknown Torvosaurus species. Torvosaurus gurneyi was about 10 m long and weighed 4 5 tons. It had blade shaped teeth up to 10 cm long, which indicates the dinosaur may have been at the top of the food chain in the Iberian Peninsula roughly 150 million years ago. The number of teeth, as well as size and shape of the mouth, may differentiate the European and the American Torvosaurus. The fossil of the upper jaw of Torvosaurus tanneri has 11 or more teeth, while Torvosaurus gurneyi has fewer than 11. The mouth bones have a different shape and structure. This is not the largest predatory dinosaur we know, said lead author Dr Christophe Hendrickx from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa and the Museu da Lourinha, Portugal. Tyrannosaurus, Carcharodontosaurus, and Giganotosaurus from the Cretaceous were bigger animals. With a skull of 1.15 m, Torvosaurus gurneyi was however one of the largest terrestrial carnivores at this epoch, and an active predator that hunted other large dinosaurs, as evidenced by blade shape teeth up to 10 cm. Fossil evidences of closely related dinosaurs suggest that this Torvosaurus gurneyi may have already been covered with proto feathers. Recently described dinosaur embryos from Portugal are also ascribed to this new Torvosaurus species.

Previous work on the fossil sites on Rusinga Island suggested a variety of contradictory environmental preferences for Proconsul and that none of the previous work could definitively tie Proconsul to a specific habitat, said Dr Daniel Peppe of Baylor University, who is a co author of the paper published in the journal Nature Communications. Our research findings provide direct evidence and confirm where the early ape lived about 18 to 20 million years ago. We now know that Proconsul lived in a closed canopy, tropical seasonal forest set in a warm and relatively wet local climate. Dr McNulty, Dr Peppe and their colleagues found fossils of a single individual of Proconsul among geological deposits that also contained tree stump casts, calcified roots and fossil leaves. This discovery underscores the importance of forested environments in the evolution of early apes, Dr Peppe noted. While excavating one of the major fossil sites on Rusinga Island, our team found four teeth from Proconsul amid an expansive fossil forest system, added Lauren Michel, a doctoral student at Baylor University. Ultimately, we were able to find 29 tree stump casts and unearth root casts in the same horizon as the fossil teeth. The varying diameters of the tree stumps coupled with their density within the fossil soil, implies that the forest would have been comprised of trees with interlocking or overlapping branches, thus creating a canopy. Also, further evidence from the excavation site has shown that the landscape was stable for decades to a few hundred years while the forest grew. Adding to the novelty of the findings is how all of forest artifacts were contained in one layer or strata. What is spectacular about this discovery is that all of these individual elements  tree stumps, leaves, roots, animals  are tied together in a single stratigraphic interval. This gives us tremendous resolution in reconstructing the specific environment inhabited by one of our early ape ancestors, Dr McNulty explained. Researchers were also able to determine the climate for the fossil forest. Evidence from the forest fossil soil suggests that the precipitation was seasonal with a distinct wet and dry period, Dr Peppe said. During the dry season, there was probably relatively little rainfall. Additionally, by studying fossil leaves at the site, we were able to estimate that there was about 55 to 100 inches of rainfall a year and the average annual temperature was between 73 and 94 degrees Fahrenheit. "}, {"title": " Study Sheds More Light on Origin of Birds", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Feb 25, 2014", "doc": "According to new research on the first birds and bird like dinosaurs Paraves which lived 160 to 120 million years ago, bird wings and small body size arose much earlier than scientists previously believed. We were really surprised to discover that the key size shifts happened at the same time, at the origin of Paraves, said Mr Mark Puttick from the University of Bristol, UK, the lead author of a paper published in the journal Evolution. This was at least 20 million years before the first bird, the famous Archaeopteryx, and it shows that flight in birds arose through several evolutionary steps. Being small and light is important for a flyer, and it now seems a whole group of dozens of little dinosaurs were lightweight and had wings of one sort or another. Most were gliders or parachutists, spreading their feathered wings, but not flapping them. Out of all these flappers and gliders, only the birds seem to have been capable of powered flight, said study senior author Prof Mike Benton, also from the University of Bristol. But you wouldnt have picked out Archaeopteryx as the founder of a remarkable new group. Mr Puttick and his colleagues applied new numerical methods that calculate the rate of evolution of different characteristics across a whole evolutionary tree, and identify where bursts of fast evolution occurred. Up to now you could only have guessed roughly where the major evolutionary transitions occurred, but the new methods pinpoint the size changes. The small size of birds and their long wings originated long before birds themselves did, said co author Dr Gavin Thomas from the University of Sheffield. Birds owe their success to their flight, wings and feathers. Until the 1990s, when the first feathered dinosaurs were found in China, birds were thought to have originated rapidly, marking a major transition from dinosaurs. Now, paleontologists know that Archaeopteryx was only one of a large number of small, flying dinosaurs. The origin of birds used to be seen as a rapid transition, but now we know that the key characteristics we associate with them arose much earlier, Mr Puttick said.

Dr Xiao Chun Wu and his colleagues named the new prehistoric creature Atopodentatus unicus and suggest it belonged to a group of reptiles called the sauropterygians. Generic name is derived from the Latin atopo for the peculiar dentition and dentatus for teeth the specific name is derived from the Latin unicus for its unique morphology, the scientists said in a paper published in the journal Naturwissenschaften. Atopodentatus unicus measured about 3 m long and had a long body, short neck and special adaptations for a fully aquatic or semi aquatic lifestyle. Its nearly complete skeleton and a left lateral side of the skull were collected from the middle Triassic of Guanling Formation near Daaozi village, Yunnan, China. The most distinguishing characteristic of Atopodentatus unicus is its bizarre mouth. On each side of the mouth, the reptile had about 35 small needle like teeth in the front of the upper jaw, about 140 small needle like teeth in the rest of the upper jaw at least 100 in the horizontal portion and around 35 in the vertical portion, and more than 190 teeth in the lower jaw about 100 in the horizontal portion and 90 in the shovel headed anterior end. The teeth were covered by a layer of enamel. According to Dr Wus team, Atopodentatus unicus may have been adapted to a way of bottom filter feeding in water. It is obvious that such delicate teeth are not strong enough to catch prey, but were probably used as a barrier to filter microorganisms or benthic invertebrates such as sea worms, they said. These were collected by the specialized jaws, which may have functioned as a shovel or pushdozer and a grasper or scratcher.

Trilobites by Heinrich Harder, 1916. Discoveries like this are so important because they are at the core of our understanding of early evolutionary breakthroughs, said study lead author Prof Gabriela M\u00e1ngano from the University of Saskatchewan. Prof M\u00e1ngano and her colleagues discovered a huge number of fossilized trilobite tracks in rocks from the Appalachian Mountains. The fossils reveal trilobites moved closer to the land during the Cambrian explosion some 540 million years ago The Cambrian explosion is when almost all modern groups of animals appeared for the first time in the fossil record and the tidal flats likely served as a rich area for the creatures to forage food and for nesting activities. The rocks also showed signs of cracks from periodic drying, suggesting prolonged exposure to subaerial conditions. Trilobites are distantly related to crabs, scorpions and beetles and were once widely distributed, Prof M\u00e1ngano said. This makes them useful tools to compare the ages of rock strata in different parts of the world.

Recent excavations in south Majiashan, Anhui, China, yielded more than 80 new ichthyosaur skeletons. Among the specimens was a partial skeleton that contained embryos. According to Dr Chen and colleagues, the fossil belongs to the ichthyosaur Chaohusaurus, which is the oldest of Mesozoic marine reptiles. This viviparous creature lived around 248 million years ago. It had a lizard like appearance and was one of the smallest ichthyosaurs up to 1.8 m long. The new fossil was associated with three embryos and neonates one inside the mother, another exiting the pelvis with half the body still inside the mother and the third outside of the mother. The headfirst birth posture of the second embryo indicates that live births in ichthyosaurs may have taken place on land, instead of in the water, as some studies have previously suggested. The study reports the oldest vertebrate fossil to capture the moment of live birth, with a baby emerging from the pelvis of its mother. The 248 million year old fossil of an ichthyosaur suggests that live bearing evolved on land and not in the sea, said Dr Ryosuke Motani from the University of California, Davis, the first author of a paper published in the journal PLoS ONE. The Chaohusaurus fossil may also contain the oldest fossil embryos of Mesozoic marine reptile, about 10 million years older than those indicated on previous records. Live births in land reptiles may have appeared much earlier than previously thought, the scientists said.

About 96 percent of marine life and 70 percent of terrestrial life became extinct during what is known as the end Permian extinction. Many studies tried to explain the cause of this extinction, including an asteroid impact, massive volcanic eruptions, or a cataclysmic cascade of environmental events. But finding the cause requires better measurements of how long the extinction period lasted. A 2011 study reported that the end Permian extinction likely lasted less than 200,000 years. However, this timeframe still wasnt precise enough to draw any conclusions about what caused it. In a new study, paleontologists led by Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist Dr Seth Burgess have revised previous estimates using more accurate dating techniques and found that the end Permian extinction happened in just 60,000 years. Weve got the extinction nailed in absolute time and duration. How do you kill 96 percent of everything that lived in the oceans in tens of thousands of years? It could be that an exceptional extinction requires an exceptional explanation, said Prof Sam Bowring, also from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is a co author of the paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Prof Bowring with colleagues also found that, 10,000 years before the die off, the oceans experienced a pulse of light carbon, which likely reflects a massive addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This dramatic change may have led to widespread ocean acidification and increased sea temperatures by 10 degrees Celsius or more, killing the majority of sea life. But what originally triggered the spike in carbon dioxide? The leading theory has to do with widespread, long lasting volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps, a region of Russia whose steplike hills are a result of repeated eruptions of magma. It is clear that whatever triggered extinction must have acted very quickly, fast enough to destabilize the biosphere before the majority of plant and animal life had time to adapt in an effort to survive, Dr Burgess, who is the lead author on the PNAS paper. The new timeline adds weight to the Siberian Traps theory. With such a short extinction timeline, it is possible that a single, catastrophic pulse of magmatic activity triggered an almost instantaneous collapse of all global ecosystems, Prof Bowring said. To confirm whether the Siberian Traps are indeed the extinctions smoking gun, the team plans to determine an equally precise timeline for the Siberian Traps eruptions, and will compare it to the new extinction timeline to see where the two events overlap.

Dimetrodon was the top of the terrestrial food chain in the early Permian and is considered to be the forerunner of mammals. According to a new study reported in the journal Nature Communications, dimetrodons had a diversity of previously unknown tooth structures and were also the first terrestrial vertebrate to develop cusps  teeth with raised points on the crown, which are dominant in mammals. The study also suggests ziphodont teeth were confined to later species of dimetrodon, indicating a gradual change in feeding habits. Left a tooth of Dimetrodon grandis. Scale bar  0.5\u2009cm.

This research is an important step in reconstructing the structure of ancient complex communities, said senior author Prof Robert Reisz from the University of Toronto Mississauga. Teeth tell us a lot more about the ecology of animals than just looking at the skeleton. We already know from fossil evidence which animals existed at that time but now with this type of research we are starting to piece together how the members of these communities interacted. Prof Reisz and his co author, Kirstin Brink from the University of Toronto Mississauga, studied the changes in dimetrodon teeth across 25 million years of evolution. The analysis indicated the changes in tooth structure occurred in the absence of any significant evolution in skull morphology. This indicates a change in feeding style and trophic interactions.

The newly discovered whale has been named Balaenoptera bertae in honor of Prof Annalisa Berta from San Diego State University. It belongs to the same genus as minke and fin whales, indicating that the Balaenoptera lineage has lasted for about 3 million years. Mr Boessenecker unearthed the Balaenoptera bertaes incomplete skull at the Purisima Formation in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2005. It was encased in a hard concretion that took five years to remove. Balaenoptera bertae would have been approximately 5 6 meters in length, slightly smaller than modern minke whales, said Mr Boessenecker, who is the author of a paper published in the journal Geodiversitas. Mr Boessenecker in his study has also put together a record of 21 extinct species of marine mammals that inhabited the North Pacific in the Pliocene. The mix of marine mammals I ended up uncovering was almost completely different to that found in the North Pacific today, and to anywhere else at that time. Primitive porpoises and baleen whales were living side by side with comparatively modern marine mammals such as the Northern fur seal and right whales. And species far geographically and climatically removed from their modern relatives also featured, such as beluga like whales and tusked walruses, which today live in the Arctic. Mr Boessenecker added at the same time as this eclectic mix of ancient and modern type marine mammals was living together, the marine mammal fauna in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean were already in the forms we find today. This strange fauna existed up until as recently as one or two million years ago. Its weirdness was likely maintained by warm equatorial waters and barriers to migration by other marine mammals posed by the newly formed Isthmus of Panama, and the still closed Bering Strait. Once the Bering Strait opened and the equatorial Pacific cooled during the Ice Age, modernized marine mammals were able to migrate from other ocean basins into the North Pacific, leading to the mix we see today, Mr Boessenecker concluded.

This is an artists impression of a sucker footed bat. Today, Myzopodidae consists of two extant species  the Madagascar sucker footed bat Myzopoda aurita and the Western sucker footed bat Myzopoda schliemanni. In contrast to almost all other bats, these bats dont cling upside down to cave ceilings or branches. Sucker footed bats roost head up, often in the furled leaves of the travelers palm, a plant in the bird of paradise family. To stick to such a smooth surface, the bats evolved cup like pads on their wrists and ankles. Biologists previously suspected the pads held the bats up by suction, but recent studies have demonstrated the bats instead rely on wet adhesion, like a tree frog. Today, these bats live nowhere outside Madagascar, but the newly discovered bat fossils show that hasnt always been the case. The study, published in the journal PLoS ONE, is the first formal description of Myzopodidae in the fossil record. The discovery shows that, like many island dwelling, relict species, sucker footed bats have not always been confined to their present range  they once swooped through the African skies. Weve assumed for a long time that they were an ancient lineage based on DNA sequence studies that have placed them close to very old groups in the bat family tree, said study co author Dr Nancy Simmons from the American Museum of Natural History. The two new species, named Phasmatonycteris phiomensis and Phasmatonycteris butleri, date to 30 and 37 million years ago, respectively, when the environment was drastically different. Northern Africa was more tropical and was home to a diverse range of mammals, including primates and early members of the elephant family, Dr Simmons said. The habitat was probably fairly forested, and there was likely a proto Nile River, a big river that led into the ancient Tethys Ocean. The fossilized teeth imply that, like their living relatives, the ancient bats fed on insects, added lead author Dr Gregg Gunnell of the Duke University Lemur Center. Its impossible to know from the fossils if the extinct species had already evolved their characteristic sucker feet, but the teeth shed light on another aspect of bat evolution. The presence of sucker footed bats in Africa at least 37 million years ago supports the theory that this family is one of the most primitive members of Noctilionoidea, a bat superfamily that now dominates South America. We think that the superfamily originated in Africa and moved eastward as Gondwana was coming apart. These bats migrated to Australia, then actually went through Antarctica and up into South America using an ice free corridor that connected the three continents until about 26 million years ago, Dr Gunnell said. According to this hypothesis, the sucker footed bat fossils showed up right where scientists expected to find them at the literal and figurative base of the Noctilionoidea family tree. Now, we can unambiguously link them through Africa, Dr Simmons concluded.

The new dinosaur, named Yongjinglong datangi, belonged to a group of dinosaurs known as Titanosauria. Three teeth, eight vertebrae, the left shoulder blade, the right radius and ulna of the prehistoric giant were unearthed in the Lanzhou Basin of Gansu province, northwestern China, in 2008. Yongjinglong datangi measured about 15 18 meters long and was a medium sized Titanosaur. However, anatomical evidence points to it being a juvenile adults may have been larger, the scientists said. The anatomical features of its bones bear some resemblance to another Titanosaur from China, Euhelopus zdanskyi, but the paleontologists were able to identify a number of unique characteristics. The shoulder blade was very long, nearly 2 meters, with sides that were nearly parallel, unlike many other Titanosaurs whose scapulae bow outward, said Ms Liguo Li of the University of Pennsylvania, who is the lead author of a paper published in the open access journal PLoS ONE. The scapula was so long, indeed, that it did not appear to fit in the animals body cavity if placed in a horizontal or vertical orientation, as is the case with other dinosaurs. The bone must have been oriented at an angle of 50 degrees from the horizontal. In addition, an unfused portion of the shoulder blade indicated that the specimen was a juvenile or subadult. The scapula and coracoid arent fused here. It is open, leaving potential for growth, Ms Li said. Thus, a full grown adult might be larger than this 15 18 meter long individual. Future finds may help elucidate just how much larger.

The bird, named Australornis lovei, is one of the worlds oldest species of flying seabirds. The fossil bones of Australornis lovei were collected from the Waipara greensand deposits of North Canterbury, New Zealands South Island. These deposits were formed in the deep waters of a very warm sea off the coast of Zealandia  the continental fragment that New Zealand rests upon, shortly after the event that caused the mass extinction of the dinosaurs and many marine organisms. Australornis lovei was about 70  85 cm in length and weighed 1.5  2 kg. The bird had similarities to two species from the late Cretaceous from the Antarctic Peninsula. This new species is important in our understanding of bird evolution because although there is a number of bird groups described from the late Cretaceous, most belong to groups not present on Earth today, said Dr Paul Scofield of New Zealands Canterbury Museum, the second author of a paper published in the Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand.

Named Enalikter aphson, the ancient animal belonged to Megacheira, an extinct group of marine dwelling short great appendage arthropods. It would have lived on the seabed in water possibly up to about 100 or 200 m deep, at a time known as the Silurian, when invertebrates were just beginning to move onto land. It would have been a very warm, subtropical environment, said Prof Derek Siveter from the Oxford Universitys Museum of Natural History, who is the lead author on a paper published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Enalikter aphson was about 2.4 cm long with a rounded rectangular head, no eyes and a curved, whip like feature protruding from in front of its mouth that may have been used in feeding  for example to capture smaller marine invertebrates. At the rear end of its stick like body there were two pincer like projections that were attached to a primitive tail. The animal had no hard shell but is nevertheless remarkably well preserved in a hard nodule of minerals comprised mainly of calcite. Enalikter aphson had a soft and flexible body so it is incredible that it survived. The nodule acted like a womb and kept the creature free from decay and destruction, which would normally have happened very quickly. It meant it was able to survive all the earth movements and history that have happened since, Prof Siveter said. To reconstruct Enalikter aphson in 3D, the team imaged sequential surfaces of the fossil, spaced a mere 20 microns apart. These numerous images were then edited on a computer, in places pixel by pixel, to identify true biological structures from background noise. The discovery of Enalikter aphson gives support to the notion that Megacheira came before the last common ancestor of all living arthropods in the tree of life. If correct, this would indicate that megacheirans were distant ancestors of all arthropods alive today. It has provided us with exceptional data for the fossil record. Its soft body shell, or cuticle, is less than 10 microns thick. It was organic but has not decayed. That is amazing. Such exceptional preservation represents the jewel in the crown of paleontology and provides so much more information than what does the typical shelly fossil record. It offers a rare window on the marine community back then, Prof Siveter said.

Big headed flies are a group of bizarre insects whose round heads are almost entirely covered by their bulging compound eyes, which they use to hunt for mainly leafhoppers and planthoppers, renowned common garden insect pests, Dr Archibald said. The three new species belong to the living family Pipunculidae, which includes more than 1,300 species found worldwide. One fossil, Metanephrocerus belgardeae, is well enough preserved to name as a new species, Dr Archibald said. It is named in honor of its finder, Azure Rain Belgarde, a student at the Paschal Sherman Indian School, who uncovered it on a field trip to the fossil deposits at Republic, Washington state. The other two unnamed, more enigmatic species are described from less complete fossils uncovered at Quilchena in southern British Columbia. The newly discovered species were preserved in Eocene epoch fossil beds that are 49 to 52 million years old, which is about 12 to 15 million years after the extinction of the dinosaurs. This great extinction event also disrupted forests in which the dinosaurs had lived, with mostly low diversity and greatly disrupted food webs for millions of years, said Dr Archibald, who is the lead author of a paper published in the Canadian Entomologist. By the time of these flies in the Eocene, however, forests had diversified again, but this time with many new kinds of flowering plants that are familiar to us today, such as birches, maples, and many others. Along with these new, rich forests came an expanding diversity of pollinators and herbivorous insects, and with them, diversification of their insect predators, including these big headed flies. With these new discoveries, we see that the early history of these oddly shaped insect predators provides a part of the puzzle revealing the broad ecological evolutionary revolution of expanding predator prey relationships and increasing biodiversity during the formation of new ecosystems, Dr Archibald said.

Hoatzins Opisthocomus hoazin, also known as Hoactzins, Stinkbirds, or Canje Pheasants, are a large species of bird found in the Amazon and other regions of South America. These birds can measure up to 70 cm in length and weigh up to 0.9 kg. They have a reddish brown color streaked with green. Hoatzins are noisy birds, and have a wide variety of vocalizations. They are also recognized for their odor, comparable to manure. These birds are vegetarians and tend to forage around dawn and dusk. While foraging, they favor young leaves, buds, and shoots which are typically higher in nutrients, easier to digest, and higher in water. They are rarely observed to drink, as much of their water comes from their food. Hoatzins are poor fliers. Their flight is usually restricted to short movements from tree to tree, but they are able to cover distances of up to 350 m in a single flight. These birds build simple platform nests of sticks in trees that overhang the water. The females usually lay a double clutch, but sometimes there may be three eggs. Both adults care for the chicks, and help in nest construction and incubation. Young hoatzins have hooks on their wings, similar to the prehistoric Archaeopteryx. Hoatzins were until recently thought to have originated in South America. However, fossils of ancient hoatzin like birds from Africa and Europe now prove conclusively that hoatzins reached South America from the Old World. A new study, reported in the January 2014 issue of the journal Auk, provides the first evidence of largely modern hoatzins in the Miocene of Africa about 15 million years ago. Another study, published online this month in the journal Naturwissenschaften, describes a hoatzin like bird  Protoazin parisiensis proto hoatzin from Paris  that lived in what is modern France during the late Eocene, around 34 million years ago. This supports the theory that hoatzins originated in the Old World, said Dr Gerald Mayr, the lead author on both papers. It is a further impressive example that the South American avian fauna contains numerous relicts that were once much more widespread, added Dr Vanesa De Pietri, a co author of the Naturwissenschaften paper. Most notably, hoatzins appear to have become extinct in Europe much earlier than in Africa, where the latest fossils were dated as of Miocene age and are thus only around half as old. The disappearance of these birds might be connected to a period when numerous new animal species migrated from Asia to Europe during the so called Grande Coupure around 34 million years ago.

Protorosaurs were a diverse group of predatory reptiles that flourished from the latest Permian to the early Late Triassic in what are now Asia, Europe and North America. They were characterized by their long necks and elongated neck vertebrae. The most bizarre of these reptiles was the long necked Tanystropheus longobardicus, which had a neck up to 3 m long. Unusual among protorosaurs, the newly discovered reptile, Fuyuansaurus acutirostris, had a very elongate snout. The markedly elongate rostrum that is more reminiscent of an ichthyosaur or certain thalattosaurs is unique for a protorosaur, the paleontologists wrote in a paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Fuyuansaurus acutirostris was similar to protorosaurs Tanytrachelos and Tanystropheus in having an unusually long neck containing 12 or 13 vertebrae. The back two thirds of the skull, part of skeleton, and the majority of both the pectoral and pelvic girdles of the new protorosaur were collected from the Falang Formation at Jiyangshan, Yunnan Province, China. The relatively large orbit and lack of complete fusion between the neural arches and centra of the dorsal vertebrae indicate that this may be an immature individual, explained lead author Dr Nicholas Fraser of the National Museums Scotland. Fuyuansaurus acutirostris had numerous needle like teeth that suggest a diet of crustaceans and fish. The genus name, Fuyuansaurus, is after the locality where it was discovered. The specific name, acutirostris, refers to the elongate preorbital region of the skull.

The fossilized pelves and a pelvic fin of Tiktaalik roseae reveal that the evolution of hind legs actually began as enhanced hind fins, according to the scientists. This challenges existing theory that large, mobile hind appendages were developed only after vertebrates transitioned to land. Previous theories, based on the best available data, propose that a shift occurred from front wheel drive locomotion in fish to more of a four wheel drive in tetrapods. But it looks like this shift actually began to happen in fish, not in limbed animals, said Prof Shubin, who is the lead author of the paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Discovered in 2004 by Prof Shubin, Dr Edward Daeschler of Drexel University, and the late Dr Farish A. Jenkins, Jr., of Harvard University, Tiktaalik roseae is the best known transitional species between fish and land dwelling tetrapods. Tiktaalik roseae lived in Devonian period around 375 million years ago. It was a predator with sharp teeth, a crocodile like head and a flattened body. The animal looked like a cross between a fish and a crocodile, growing up to a length of 9 feet as it hunted in shallow freshwater environments. Tiktaalik roseae had gills, scales and fins, but also a mobile neck, robust ribcage and primitive lungs. In particular, its large forefins had shoulders, elbows and partial wrists, which allowed it to support itself on ground. Only specimens containing the front portion of the animal, however, have been described thus far. As the researchers investigated additional blocks recovered from their expeditions to the dig site in northern Canada, they discovered the rear portion of Tiktaalik roseae. The fossils included the complete pelvis of the original type specimen, making it possibly to directly compare the front and rear appendages of the animal. The scientists were immediately struck by the pelvis, which was comparable to those of some early tetrapods. It was still clearly fish like, but the expanded size, mobility and robusticity of the pelvic girdle, hip joint and fin of Tiktaalik roseae made a wide range of motor behaviors possible. Its reasonable to suppose with those big fin rays that Tiktaalik roseae used its hind fins to swim like a paddle. But its possible it could walk with them as well. African lungfish living today have similarly large pelves, and we showed in 2011 that they walk underwater on the bottom, Prof Shubin said. Regardless of the gait Tiktaalik roseae used, its clear that the emphasis on hind appendages and pelvic propelled locomotion is a trend that began in fish, and was later exaggerated during the origin of tetrapods.

The long snouted Bandringa shark Elasmobranchii, Chondrichthyes  a bottom feeding predator that lived in an ancient river delta system in what is today the Upper Midwest  is likely one of the earliest close relatives of modern sharks. It resembled present day sawfish and paddlefish, with a spoon billed snout up to half its body length. Juveniles were 4 to 6 inches long and grew into adults of up to 10 feet. Bandringa sharks were discovered in 1969 and soon became one of the most prized fossils from the well known Mazon Creek deposits in northern Illinois. Until now, paleontologists believed that the genus Bandringa contained two species  B. rayi and B. herdinae, one that lived in freshwater swamps and rivers and another that lived in the shallow ocean. But after reevaluating fossils from 24 individuals, Dr Lauren Sallan and Dr Michael Coates concluded that Bandringa was a single species that lived, at various times during its life, in fresh, brackish and salt water. The physical differences between the two purported species were due to different preservation processes at marine and freshwater locations. The freshwater sites tended to preserve bones and cartilage, while the marine sites preserved soft tissue, explained Dr Sallan and Dr Coates, co authors of the paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. By combining the complementary data sets from both types of fossil sites and reclassifying Bandringa as a single species, the team gained a far more complete picture of the extinct sharks anatomy and discovered several previously unreported features. They include downward directed jaws ideal for suction feeding off the bottom, needle like spines on the head and cheeks, and a complex array of sensory organs on both the extended snout and body, suited for detecting prey in murky water. The Bandringa fossils also reveal the only known example of a freshwater to saltwater shark migration, as well as a 310 million year old shark nursery where fossilized egg cases and juvenile sharks were preserved in the same sediments. Adult Bandringa sharks lived exclusively in freshwater swamps and rivers, the scientists said. Females apparently traveled downstream to a tropical coastline to lay their eggs in shallow marine waters, a reverse version of the modern day salmons sea to stream migration.

Previously, paleontologists could only guess what colors huge reptiles such as mosasaurs and ichthyosaurs had. However, pigments preserved in fossilized skin of these prehistoric animals have now revealed that they were, at least partially, dark colored in life. This feature probably contributed to more efficient thermoregulation, as well as provided means for camouflage and protection against harmful UV radiation. The fossils are composed of skeletal remains, in addition to dark skin patches containing masses of micrometer sized, oblate bodies. These microbodies were previously interpreted to be the fossilized remains of those bacteria that once contributed to the decomposition and degradation of the carcasses. However, by studying the chemical content of the soft tissues, a team of researchers from Europe and the United States was able to show that they are in fact remnants of the animals own colors, and that the bodies are fossilized melanosomes, or pigment containing cellular organelles. Our results really are amazing. The pigment melanin is almost unbelievably stable. Our discovery enables us to make a journey through time and to revisit these ancient reptiles using their own biomolecules, said Dr Per Uvdal of the Lund Universitys MAX IV Laboratory, a co author of the study published in the journal Nature. Now, we can finally use sophisticated molecular and imaging techniques to learn what these animals looked like and how they lived. Mosasaurs 9866 million years ago are giant marine lizards that could reach 15 m in body length, whereas ichthyosaurs 25094 million years ago could become even larger. Both ichthyosaurs and mosasaurs died out during the Cretaceous Period, but leatherback turtles are still around today. A noticeable feature of the living leatherback turtle, Dermochelys coriacea, is that it has an almost entirely black back, which probably contributes to its worldwide distribution. The ability of leatherback turtles to survive in cold climates has mainly been attributed to their huge size, but it has also been shown that these animals bask at the sea surface during daylight hours. The black color enables them to heat up faster and to reach higher body temperatures than had they instead been lightly colored. The fossil leatherback turtle probably had a similar color scheme and lifestyle as does Dermochelys, explained lead author Dr Johan Lindgren of Lund University. Similarly, mosasaurs and ichthyosaurs, which also had worldwide distributions, may have used their darkly colored skin to heat up quickly between dives.

The fossil animal, scientifically named Dormaalocyon latouri, is one of the earliest ancestors of all modern day carnivorous mammals carnivoraforms. Its description allows better understanding of the origination, variability and ecology of the earliest carnivoraforms, said Dr Flor\u00e9al Sol\u00e9 from both the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and the Mus\u00e9um National dHistoire Naturelle in France, the lead author of a paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Over 250 teeth and ankle bones of Dormaalocyon latouri have been unearthed at the Belgian locality of Dormaal. The finds include the deciduous teeth, or baby teeth. The fact that these teeth are very primitive looking, and from a very early time, implies that Dormaalocyon latouri is close to the origin of carnivoraforms, and that this origin may have been in Europe. The ankle bones suggest that Dormaalocyon latouri was a tree dwelling mammal. Previous reconstructions of the environment at Dormaal 55 million years ago inferred a warm, humid, and wooded area. This was a time soon after an event called the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum. This extremely warm period affected the evolution of many mammal groups, including carnivoraforms. The fact that Dormaalocyon latouri was arboreal, and that carnivoraforms made their way to North America around this time, supports the existence of a continuous evergreen forest belt at high latitudes during the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum, Dr Sol\u00e9 explained. Although close to the origin of carnivoraforms, the fossils suggest there were even more primitive species in the group in an earlier time period, the Paleocene. The understanding of the origination of the carnivoraforms is important for reconstructing the adaptation of placental mammals to carnivorous diet. Therefore, Dormaalocyon latouri provides information concerning the evolution of placental mammals after the disappearance of the largest dinosaurs at the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event. Dr Sol\u00e9 concluded our study shows that the carnivoraforms were very diversified at the earliest Eocene, which allows hypothesizing that they were probably already diversified during the latest Paleocene. This means there are more fossils out there to be found that can answer the question of the origin of this beloved modern group.

Ectobius is an extant genus of cockroaches family Blattellidae, subfamily Ectobiinae inhabiting Europe, the Eastern Palearctic ecozone and the Near East. These cockroaches first appeared in the fossil record in Europe around 44 million years old. The lineage was believed to have been exclusively from the Old World. However, the newly discovered fossil species, named Ectobius kohlsi, has uprooted that view. In fact, it now appears that Ectobius cockroaches may have originated in North America. The paleontologists have discovered Ectobius kohlsi and three undetermined species in the 49 million year old Green River Formation near Rifle, Colorado in deposits that are about 5 million years older than the oldest European specimens. However, these cockroaches soon became extinct in North America. The cause for the extinction of Ectobius in North America in the dim past is unknown, but it evidently survived in the Old World, and western Europe in particular. In many ways the history of Ectobius mirrors that of the biogeographic history of the horse. Horses occurred in the New World and became extinct during the late Pleistocene ecological crisis. Horses, attached to human habitation, were subsequently introduced to North America by early Spanish explorers about 11,000 years after their demise. Ectobius kohlsi is named after David Kohls, who lives near Rifle, Colorado and has been an indefatigable collector of fossil insects and plants from the nearby Green River Formation. His collection of approximately 150,000 insects from 31,000 slabs of shale now constitutes the Kohls Green River Fossil Insect Collection, which is housed in the Smithsonians Department of Paleobiology, explained Dr Conrad Labandeira of the Smithsonian Institutions National Museum of Natural History, who is the senior author of the paper published in the Annals of the Entomological Society of America.

The amber contains 18 tiny flowers of a previously unknown Cretaceous plant genus and species, named Micropetasos burmensis. The perfectly preserved scene is part of a portrait created when flowering plants were changing the face of the Earth forever, adding beauty, biodiversity and food. It appears identical to the reproduction process that flowering plants angiosperms still use today. The flower cluster is one of the most complete ever found in amber and appeared at a time when many of the flowering plants were still quite small. Even more remarkable is the microscopic image of pollen tubes growing out of two grains of pollen and penetrating the flowers stigma, the receptive part of the female reproductive system. This sets the stage for fertilization of the egg and would begin the process of seed formation  had the reproductive act been completed. In Cretaceous flowers weve never before seen a fossil that shows the pollen tube actually entering the stigma. This is the beauty of amber fossils. They are preserved so rapidly after entering the resin that structures such as pollen grains and tubes can be detected with a microscope, said Prof George Poinar, Jr., from the Oregon State Universitys College of Science, who is the lead author of a paper published in the Journal of the Botanical Institute of Texas full paper in .pdf. The pollen of these flowers appeared to be sticky, suggesting it was carried by a pollinating insect, and adding further insights into the biodiversity and biology of life in this distant era. At that time much of the plant life was composed of conifers, ferns, mosses, and cycads. During the Cretaceous, new lineages of mammals and birds were beginning to appear, along with the flowering plants. But dinosaurs still dominated the Earth. The evolution of flowering plants caused an enormous change in the biodiversity of life on Earth, especially in the tropics and subtropics, Dr Poinar said. New associations between these small flowering plants and various types of insects and other animal life resulted in the successful distribution and evolution of these plants through most of the world today. Its interesting that the mechanisms for reproduction that are still with us today had already been established some 100 million years ago. Poinar GO et al. 2013.

Cursorial hyenas Chasmaporthetes, also known as hunting or running hyenas, are an extinct genus of hyenas endemic to North America, Africa, and Asia during Pliocene and Pleistocene periods. The oldest representatives of Chasmaporthetes appeared in the late Miocene of Greece, Chad, and China. However, the genus was already widespread at the time of their earliest record around 7 million years ago. By the early Pliocene, Chasmaporthetes crossed the Bering land bridge to America, where they evolved into Chasmaporthetes ossifragus, becoming North Americas only native hyena before being brought to extinction by the end of the Ice Age. The new fossils of Chasmaporthetes, including partial lower jaws, maxillae, and toe bones, were collected from the Pliocene deposits of the Zanda Basin in southwestern Tibetan Plateau in 2009, and identified as a new species, Chasmaporthetes gangsriensis. Chasmaporthetes gangsriensis is morphologically the most basal Pliocene Chasmaporthetes in China, and is consistent with the out of Tibet hypothesis for some Pleistocene megafauna, said Dr Zhijie Jack Tseng of Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and University of Southern California, who is the lead author of a paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Chasmaporthetes gangsriensis is the smaller among Plio Pleistocene Eurasian species of the genus.

Dr Li added recent field work in the Zanda Basin in southwestern Tibetan Plateau has provided new fossil evidence of vertebrate faunas spanning the late Miocene to Pleistocene, which represents new occurrences hitherto unknown in that region of Asia and allows the establishment of a faunal sequence in the basin for the first time.

The Great spotted kiwi, Apteryx haastii a male with a juvenile. Artwork by John Gerrard Keulemans, 1876. The kiwi is nocturnal, flightless and comparatively large bird native to New Zealand. The smallest of all ratites ostrich, emu, cassowaries, and rheas, it has only vestigial wings, about 5 cm in length. It is the only bird in the world that has its nostrils at the end of its beak. Kiwis are very vulnerable to predators  about 95 per cent of the chicks are killed by cats. About 1,000 years ago, there were 12 million kiwis by 1923, this number was down to 5 millions 70,000 were left by the 1990s. There are five extant species of kiwi distributed on North, South, Stewart and the nearshore islands of New Zealand. One of the distinguishing attributes of the kiwi is that it lays an enormous egg, which is about a quarter of the birds body weight and occupies most of the bird, said Dr Trevor Worthy of Flinders University in Adelaide, who is the lead author of the paper published in the Proceedings of the 8th International Meeting of the Society of Avian Palaeontology and Evolution paper in .pdf. Dr Stephen Jay Goulds 1986 essay, which sought to explain the origins of the kiwi eggs size, promoted the idea that the kiwi was highly derived from a large moa like ancestor, and had shrunk in size while retaining the egg size of this ancestor. But the newly discovered kiwi like bird, named Proapteryx micromeros, challenges this idea. The fossil of Proapteryx micromeros was found at St Bathans in New Zealands Central Otago in April 2012. At an estimated 234377 g, this early Miocene bird was only 0.27 0.43 times the mass of the smallest individual 880 g of Apteryx owenii, the smallest extant kiwi species. The fossil shows us that its a tiny bird about one third of the size of a small kiwi today. It suggests the opposite is, in fact, the case  that the kiwi has developed towards a larger size, a trend that is seen in many birds from the early Miocene, explained senior author Dr Paul Scofield of Canterbury Museum. The findings are supported by the genetic evidence that the kiwi is related to the Australian emu and not the New Zealand moa, an enormous emu like bird that became extinct some 700 years ago. And if, as the DNA suggests, the kiwi is related to the emu, then both shared a common ancestor that could fly. It means they were little and had wings, and that they flew to New Zealand, Dr Worthy said. It was not uncommon for birds to jump from Australia to New Zealand, citing the Mallard duck, the little banded dotterel and the cattle egret as three species which regularly fly back and forth. Dr Scofield added we need to find wing bones to put the theory beyond all doubt. Worthy TH et al. Miocene fossils show that kiwi Apteryx, Apterygidae are probably not phyletic dwarves.

Acheroraptor temertyorum is a close cousin of the Velociraptor and the youngest known member of the raptor family, known as dromaeosaurids. The jawbone fossils of the raptor were collected from the Hell Creek formation in Montana. Looking at the teeth of Acheroraptor temertyorum along with a larger sample of teeth from small meat eating dinosaurs, the paleontologists say the evidence suggests a decline in raptor diversity in North America just before the end of the Cretaceous. Acheroraptor gives us a more complete picture of the ecosystem in North America just before the great extinction that marked the end of the Age of Dinosaurs, says Dr David Evans from both the University of Toronto and the Royal Ontario Museum, the lead author of the paper describing Acheroraptor temertyorum in the journal Naturwissenschaften. The close evolutionary relationship of Acheroraptor to a small group of late occurring Asian species that includes Velociraptor suggests migration from Asia continued to shape North American dinosaur communities right up until the end of the Cretaceous period.

The duck billed dinosaurs, or the hadrosaurs, lived in what is now North America between 75 and 65 million years ago. They were giant plant eaters  about 12 m long  and filled a similar ecological role to deer, sheep, horses, cows or kangaroos today. No one ever suspected dinosaurs may have combs like roosters, because the evidence of soft tissue usually decays before fossilization, said Dr Phil Bell from the University of New England in Australia, who is the first author of the study published in the journal Current Biology. An elephants trunk or a roosters comb might never fossilize because there is no bone in them. This discovery is equivalent to learning for the first time that elephants had trunks. We have lots of skulls of Edmontosaurus, but until now there have been no clues to suggest they might have had a big fleshy crest. The fossil in question was found in deposits west of the city of Grande Prairie in west central Alberta, Canada. While we had found skin impressions on parts of the fossils body, we had no clues that a fleshy structure might have adorned the skull. When I put a chisel into the top of the skull and found the crest I realized that, based on what we thought we knew, it wasnt meant to be there. Dr Bell noted the significance of this discovery may not be limited to this one species of dinosaur. We have lots of skulls of Edmontosaurus but nothing to suggest this find so theres no reason that other strange fleshy structures couldnt have been present on a whole range of other dinosaurs including T. Rex or Triceratops. It is hard to say exactly what evolutionary purpose the combs served, but similar appendages on roosters and other male birds are used to get the girls. We could imagine a pair of Edmontosaurus sizing each other up, bellowing, and showing off their head gear to see who would come out as the dominant male and who would take charge of the herd. We may never know exactly, but it is a reminder of how much is still out there for us to learn about these fabulously bizarre creatures, Dr Bell said.

This painting shows three representatives of Hypohippus, an extinct genus of three toed horse that lived in North America during the middle Miocene, 17  11 million years ago. Painting by Heinrich Harder, 1916. The horse fills a gap in the evolutionary history of horses but is also important for documenting how old a fossil locality is and in reconstructing habitats of human forebears of the time. This horse is one piece of a very complex puzzle that has many, many pieces, said Prof Scott Simpson of Case Western Reserve University, who is a co author of the paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. The team unearthed teeth and bones of Eurygnathohippus woldegabrieli in 2001, in the Gona area of the Afar Region. This fossil horse was among the diverse array of animals that lived in the same areas as the ancient human ancestor Ardipithecus ramidus. The fossil search team spreads out to survey for fossils in the now arid badlands of the Ethiopian desert. Among the many fossils we found are the two ends of the foreleg bone  the canon  brilliant white and well preserved in the red tinted earth, Prof Simpson said. A year later, they returned and found part of the connecting shaft, which was split lengthwise but provided the crucial full length of the bone. The long slender bone indicates this ancient species was an adept runner, similar to modern zebras, and analyses of their teeth indicated they relied heavily on eating grasses in the grassy woodland environment. Eurygnathohippus woldegabrieli had longer legs than ancestral horses that lived and fed in forests about 6 million to 10 million years ago. The change helped the more recent horses cover long distances as they grazed and flee lions, sabre tooth cats and hunting hyenas that would run down their prey. The other fossils the scientists found included teeth, which are taller than their ancestors and with crowns worn flatter  more signs the horses had adapted to a grazing life. Analyses of the isotopic composition of the enamel confirmed that Eurygnathohippus woldegabrieli subsisted on grass.

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is focused on the skull of Erlikosaurus andrewsi, a 4 m long herbivorous dinosaur called a therizinosaur. Erlikosaurus lived in what is today Mongolia during Cretaceous, about 90 million years ago. Fossil evidence shows that the snout of this dinosaur was covered by a keratinous beak. The findings of the new study show that the beak of Erlikosaurus played an important role in stabilizing its skeletal structure during feeding, making the skull less susceptible to bending and deformation. It has classically been assumed that beaks evolved to replace teeth and thus save weight, as a requirement for the evolution of flight. Our results, however, indicate that keratin beaks were in fact beneficial to enhance the stability of the skull during biting and feeding, said study lead author Dr Stephan Lautenschlager from the University of Bristol, UK. Using Finite Element Analysis, a computer modeling technique routinely used in engineering, we were able to deduce very accurately how bite and muscle forces affected the skull of Erlikosaurus during the feeding process. This further allowed us to identify the importance of soft tissue structures, such as the keratinous beak, which are normally not preserved in fossils, added study co author Dr Emily Rayfield, also from the University of Bristol. Beaks evolved several times during the transitions from dinosaurs to modern birds, usually accompanied by the partial or complete loss of teeth and our study now shows that keratin covered beaks represent a functional innovation during dinosaur evolution, said co author Prof Lawrence Witmer from the Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine.

This dinosaur was a colossal predator second only to the great Tyrannosaurus rex and perhaps Acrocanthosaurus in the North American fossil record, said Dr Lindsay Zanno from the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and the Field Museum of Natural History, the lead author on the paper published in the journal Nature Communications. The prehistoric giant is named Siats meekerorum. The genus name, Siats, refers to a cannibalistic monster from the mythology of the Ute Native American people. Its specific name acknowledges the Meeker family for their support for early career paleontologists at the Field Museum. Siats meekerorum was over 9 meters long and weighed more than 4 tons. Despite its large size, the dinosaur is not a close relative of Tyrannosaurus rex and other tyrannosaurs. Rather, it belongs to the\u00a0carcharodontosaurian group of theropods, whose more famous members include giants like the Argentinean Giganotosaurus. Siats meekerorum belongs to a branch of the carcharodontosaurian family tree that was previously unknown in North America. We were thrilled to discover the first dinosaur of its kind in North America and add to mounting evidence that dinosaurs were widely dispersed across the globe 100 million years ago said Dr Peter Makovicky of the Field Museum of Natural History, who is a co author of the discovery paper. Siats meekerorum comes from the middle of a 30 million year gap in the fossil record of North American large predatory dinosaurs, during which the top predator role changed hands from carcharodontodsaurians in the Early Cretaceous to tyrannosaurs in the Late Cretaceous. The lack of fossils left paleontologists unsure about when this change happened and if tyrannosaurus outcompeted carcharodontosaurs, or assumed that niche following carcharodontosaur extinction. The upper Cedar Mountain Formation is currently one of the only rock units known to produce fossils of both groups. Teeth of tyrannosaurs from the Cedar Mountain Formation indicate that the tyrannosaurs living alongside Siats meekerorum were much smaller in stature and did not compete for the apex predator role. The huge size difference certainly suggests that tyrannosaurs were held in check by carcharodontosaurs, and only evolved into enormous apex predators after the carcharodontosaurs disappeared, Dr Makovicky said. Finding Siats in the 30 million year predator gap tells us carcharodontosaurians reigned supreme in North America for much longer than anyone had expected, Dr Zanno added. Until recently, it was thought that continental rifting in the Cretaceous caused isolation between dinosaur faunas on different continents, and the early to  middle Cretaceous faunas of North America were particularly isolated. That picture is rapidly changing through discoveries such as Siats meekerorum.

Tarsiers are small, nocturnal, predaceous primates found only in the islands of southeast Asia, including Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi, and Philippines. They are intermediate in form between lemurs and monkeys, measuring up to 15 cm long and weighing 100  150 g. These primates have very large eyes, elongated hind legs and feet, a thin tail and long fingers. Their fur is velvety or silky and buff, grayish brown, or dark brown on the back and grayish or buffy on the underside. Tarsiers are rare in the fossil record. Until now, only four fossil species have been known two from the Eocene of China and two from the Miocene of Thailand. The new Miocene species, named Hesperotarsius sindhensis, is described from four fossil teeth found in the Manchar Formation of Sindh Province, southern Pakistan. The Pakistani tarsier is morphologically distinct from all living and fossil tarsiers, but most similar to the middle Miocene Thai species Tarsius thailandicus, Dr Zijlstra with colleagues wrote in a paper published in the Journal of Human Evolution. The genus name, Hesperotarsius, is derived from the Greek word hesperos meaning western, combined with Tarsius, the type genus of the family Tarsiidae. The species is named after the Pakistani province of Sindh. The discovery of Hesperotarsius sindhensis extends the range of the family Tarsiidae more than 4,000 km to the west, according to Dr Zijlstras team.

This find suggests that big cats have a deeper evolutionary origin than previously suspected, said Dr Jack Tseng from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, who is the lead author of a paper reporting the discovery in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences. DNA evidence suggested that the Pantherinae subfamily, including lions, jaguars, tigers, leopards, snow leopards and clouded leopards so called big cats, diverged from their nearest evolutionary cousins, Felinae, which included cougars, lynxes and domestic cats, about 6.37 million years ago. However, the oldest fossils of big cats previously found were 3.6 million year old tooth fragments uncovered at Laetoli in Tanzania by Mary Leakey in the 1970s. The newly found skull fossil is important because it partially fills the gap. Dr Tsengs team unearthed it in 2010 while scouting in the remote border region between Pakistan and China, an area that takes a bumpy seven day car ride to reach from Beijing. The scientists found more than 100 bones that were likely deposited by a river eroding out of a cliff. There, below the antelope limbs and jaws, was the crushed but largely complete skull of a big cat. For the past three years, Dr Tseng and his colleagues have used both anatomical and DNA data to determine that the skull does, in fact, represent a new species, named Panthera blytheae. The species name, blytheae, honors Blythe, the snow leopard loving daughter of Paul and Heather Haaga, who are avid supporters of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. Using magnetostratigraphy, the paleontologists were able to estimate the age of the Panthera blytheaes skull at between 4.10 and 5.95 million years old. The discovery not only challenges previous suppositions about the evolution of big cats, it also helps place that evolution in a geographical context. Panthera blytheae was found in a region that overlaps the majority of current big cat habitats and suggested that the group evolved in central Asia and spread outward. In addition, recent studies suggested that the genus Panthera did not split from genus Neofelis clouded leopards until 3.72 million years ago  which the new find disproves.

The Pilbara region of Western Australia is one of the rare geological regions that provides insight into the early evolution of life on Earth, explained Prof David Wacey from the University of Western Australia, who is a co author of the paper published in the journal Astrobiology. Mound like deposits created by ancient bacteria, called stromatolites, and microfossils of bacteria have previously been discovered in this region. However, a phenomenon called microbially induced sedimentary structures had not previously been seen in rocks of this great age. Microbially induced sedimentary structures were created by microbial mats as the microbial communities responded to changes in physical sediment dynamics. A common example would be the binding together of sediment grains by microbes to prevent their erosion by water currents. The significance of microbially induced sedimentary structures is that they not only demonstrate the presence of life, but also the presence of whole microbial ecosystems that could co ordinate with one another to respond to changes in their environment. The paleontologists discovered the various microbially induced sedimentary structures in the early Archean coastal flats preserved in the Dresser Formation and found close similarities in both form and preservation style to sedimentary structures in younger rocks. The research extended the geological record of microbially induced sedimentary structures by almost 300 million years and showed that complex mat forming microbial communities likely existed almost 3.5 billion years ago, Dr Noffke concluded.

From the early Oligocene to the late Miocene, the Gargano peninsula was an island home to many endemic, now extinct animals. Some of them were subject to insular gigantism, a phenomenon where small animals that live on isolated islands tend to grow larger because of a lack of competition and predators. The newly discovered fossil giant, named Deinogalerix masinii, and the five previously known species of the genus Deinogalerix were hairy, rat like relatives of modern hedgehogs and belonged to the subfamily of gymnures moon rats. According to a paper published in the journal Geobios, Deinogalerix masinii is the smallest and oldest member of the genus ever found. The largest Deinogalerix species, Deinogalerix koenigswaldi, was around 2 feet 60 cm long and had jaws 8 inches 20 cm long. Deinogalerix masinii presents more affinities in size and proportions to the previous smallest species Deinogalerix freudenthali and Deinogalerix minor, Dr Boris Villier from the Universita degli Studi di Torino and his co authors wrote in the paper. The suit of characters testified that Deinogalerix masinii is an archaic form on the evolutionary trend toward the most derived representatives of the genus. Deinogalerix masinii was about one and a half the size of the common hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus, around 1 to 1.5 feet 30 45 cm long. The animal likely had an herbivorous diet with probable occasional feeding on invertebrates and small vertebrates. Deinogalerix masinii is named in honor of Dr Federico Masini who was involved in the first Italian collecting campaign in Gargano and continues to work on Mikrotia faunas, the authors wrote.

Fossil records of mating insects are fairly sparse, and therefore our current knowledge of mating position and genitalia orientation in the early stages of evolution is rather limited. In a study, published in the open access journal PLoS ONE, the team presents a fossil of copulating Middle Jurassic froghoppers, a type of small insect that hops from plant to plant much like tiny frogs. The well preserved fossil of these two 15 mm long froghoppers showed belly to belly mating position and depicts the male reproductive organ inserting into the female copulatory structure. This is the oldest record of copulating insects to date, and suggests that froghoppers genital symmetry and mating position have remained static for over 165 million years. We found these two very rare copulating froghoppers which provide a glimpse of interesting insect behavior and important data to understand their mating position and genitalia orientation during the Middle Jurassic, explained senior author Dr Dong Ren from the Capital Normal University in China.

This giant creature is named Lythronax argestes. The genus name, Lythronax, translates as king of gore. The specific name, argestes, refers to its geographic location in the American Southwest. A fossil skeleton of Lythronax was discovered in a geologic unit known as the Wahweap Formation, abundantly exposed in Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. Lythronax was about 24 feet 8 m long and weighed around 2.5 tons. It lived on Laramidia, a landmass formed on the western coast of a shallow sea that flooded the central region of North America, during the Late Cretaceous Period between 95 70 million years ago. Laramidia hosted a vast array of unique dinosaur species and served as the crucible of evolution for iconic dinosaur groups such as the horned and duck billed dinosaurs. Lythronax belongs to a group of carnivorous dinosaurs called tyrannosaurids, the same group as the famous Tyrannosaurus rex. Among tyrannosaurs Lythronax possesses several unique features, a short narrow snout with a wide back of the skull with forward oriented eyes. Previously, paleontologists thought this type of wide skulled tyrannosaurid only appeared 70 million years ago, whereas Lythronax shows it had evolved at least 10 million years earlier. The width of the back of the skull of Lythronax allowed it to see with an overlapping field of view  giving it the binocular vision  very useful for a predator and a condition we associate with T. rex, explained Dr Mark Loewen from both Natural History Museum of Utah and the University of Utah, who is the lead author of the article published in the open access journal PLoS ONE. The discovery of Lythronax also indicates that tyrannosaurid dinosaurs likely evolved in isolation on Laramidia. Paleontologists have recently determined that the dinosaurs of southern Laramidia Utah, New Mexico, Texas and Mexico, although belonging to the same major groups, differ at the species level from those on northern Laramidia Montana, Wyoming, the Dakotas and Canada. Lythronax may demonstrate that tyrannosaurs followed a pattern similar to what we see in other dinosaurs from this age, with different species living in the north and south at the same time, said co author Dr Joseph Sertich, also from Natural History Museum of Utah and the University of Utah. These patterns of dinosaur distribution across Laramidia lead the scientists to ask what might have caused the divisions between the north and south, given that an enterprising dinosaur could have walked from Alaska to Mexico if given enough time. Co author Dr Randall Irmis from Natural History Museum of Utah explained that by analyzing the evolutionary relationships, geologic age and geographic distribution of tyrannosaurid dinosaurs, the team determined that Lythronax and other tyrannosaurids diversified between 95 to 80 million years ago, during a time when North Americas interior sea was at its widest extent. The incursion of the seaway onto large parts of low lying Laramidia would have separated small areas of land from each other, allowing different species of dinosaurs to evolve in isolation on different parts of the landmass. As the seaway gradually retreated after 80 million years ago, these differences in dinosaur species may have been reinforced by climate variations, differences in food sources different prey and plants, and other factors. This hypothesis explains why the iconic Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of western North America are so different from those of the same age on other continents.

The modern platypus is a duck billed, venomous, semi aquatic mammal with webbed feet and is covered in short waterproof fur. It is one of the five extant species of monotremes, the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth. The new extinct species of platypus, named Obdurodon tharalkooschild, has been described from a unique tooth fossil found at the famous Riversleigh World Heritage Area of Queensland. The specific name, tharalkooschild, honors an Indigenous Australian creation story about the origin of the platypus. Unlike the living species, Obdurodon tharalkooschild had fully functional teeth that may have been used to kill and consume a wide range of animals that lived alongside it in ancient pools and lakes. Based on the size of its tooth, it is estimated that Obdurodon tharalkooschild would have been twice the size of the modern platypus, around 3.3 feet 1 m long. Like other platypuses, it was probably a mostly aquatic mammal, and would have lived in and around the freshwater pools in the forests that covered the Riversleigh area millions of years ago, explained Prof Suzanne Hand from the University of New South Wales, a co author of the article published in the Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology. Obdurodon tharalkooschild was a very large platypus with well developed teeth, and we think it probably fed not only on crayfish and other freshwater crustaceans, but also on small vertebrates including the lungfish, frogs, and small turtles that are preserved with it in the Two Tree Site fossil deposit. The modern platypus completely lacks teeth as an adult and instead bears horny pads in its mouth Obdurodon tharalkooschild is unlikely to have been its immediate ancestor. Toothed platypuses, Monotrematum sudamericanum, lived in what is now South America until 61 million years ago. The oldest extinct platypus found in Australia was 26 million year old Obdurodon insignis. A larger species, Obdurodon dicksoni, was found in 19 to 15 million year old deposits at Riversleigh, and the remains include the only known fossil platypus skull. While many of Riversleighs fossil deposits are now being radiometrically dated, the precise age of the particular deposit that produced the new species, Obdurodon tharalkooschild, is in doubt but is likely to be between 15 and 5 million years old.

These tracks are evidence that we had sizeable, flying birds living alongside other kinds of dinosaurs on these polar, river floodplains, about 105 million years ago, said lead author Dr Anthony Martin of Emory University in Atlanta. The footprints were found on a slab of rock from the early Cretaceous strata of the Eumeralla Formation at Dinosaur Cove, a fossil bearing site in south east of Australia. More than 100 million years ago, the location was a flood plain within a great rift valley that formed as the ancient supercontinent Gondwana broke up and Australia separated from Antarctica. The thin toed tracks in fluvial sandstone were likely made by two individual birds that were about the size of a great egret or a small heron. Rear pointing toes helped distinguish the tracks as avian, as opposed to a third nearby fossil track that was discovered at the same time, made by a non avian theropod, Dr Martin said. One of the footprints is a very rare flight landing track. I immediately knew what it was, because Ive seen many similar tracks made by egrets and herons on the sandy beaches of Georgia. He added the ancient landing track from Australia has a beautiful skid mark from the back toe dragging in the sand, likely caused as the bird was flapping its wings and coming in for a soft landing.

The ancient creature, named Neoparadoxia cecilialina, belongs to Desmostylia, an extinct order of marine mammals whose closest living relatives are elephants, sea cows and manatees. Desmostylians were large bodied herbivores with enhanced adaptations for life in water and bulk aquatic feeding. They lived around the margins of the North Pacific Ocean from the Oligocene until the end of the Miocene, 32.5 to 10.5 million years ago. A 10.5 million year old nearly complete skeleton of Neoparadoxia cecilialina was collected from the Monterey Formation in Orange County, southern California. The animal measured 8 feet long 2.44 m and was a juvenile when died. Based on life history data for living common hippos Hippopotamus amphibius, the sex of the individual cannot be determined.

Bees fossilize very poorly, and their presence in the fossil record is very patchy, said Dr Michael Schwarz from Flinders University of South Australia in Adelaide, who is a senior author of the study published in the open access journal PLoS ONE. There is a concentration of fossilized bees in amber from 45 million years ago, but earlier bees are scarcely represented in the record at all. The fossil record does, however, indicate disruption in the evolution of flowering plants consistent with the K T event. Unable to rely on fossil evidence for bees, the team turned to a technique known as molecular phylogenetic analysis that extracts fragments of bee genes and, in effect, enables scientists to track paths of genetic development retrospectively. Analyzing DNA sequences of 230 species in four tribes Ceratinini, Allodapini, Manueliini and Xylocopini of the bee group Xylocopinae from every continent except Antarctica for insight into evolutionary relationships, they began to see patterns consistent with a mass extinction. Combining fossil records with the DNA analysis, they could introduce time into the equation, learning not only how the Xylocopinae bees carpenter bees are related but also how old they are. Study lead author Dr Sandra Rehan from the University of New Hampshire said the data told us something major was happening in four tribes of carpenter bees at the same time, and it happened to be the same time as the dinosaurs went extinct. When we find that something is affecting all of them in the same way, you have to ask what that would be, Dr Schwarz added. What we found was a genetic signature that is exactly what you would expect for a massive extinction event, and it corresponds very closely in time with the extinction of the dinosaurs. Because bees are the main pollinators of flowering plants and their evolution is closely linked, the implications of extinction of bee populations are profound, and would have had major consequences for flowering plants as well as the subsequent evolution of bees themselves. Understanding extinctions and the effects of declines in the past can help us understand the pollinator decline and the global crisis in pollinators today, Dr Rehan concluded.

Parasaurolophus is well known for a long and hollow bony tube on the top of its skull, which paleontologists speculate was used like a trumpet to blast sound for communication, as well as a billboard for visual display. Although partial skulls and skeletons of full grown Parasaurolophus have been known for almost a century, scientists previously knew little about how this species grew up. The young Parasaurolophus, dubbed Joe, was unearthed by student Kevin Terris in Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, southern Utah, in 2009. Joe was less than 6 feet long and under a year old when it died, and would have grown to an adult measuring 25 feet long. Intriguingly, the fossil shows that Joe had a low bump on top of its head, which only later morphed into the curved tube of adults. Our baby Parasaurolophus is barely one quarter of adult size, but it had already started growing its crest. This is surprising, because related dinosaurs didnt sprout their ornamentation until they were at least half grown. Parasaurolophus had to get an early start in order to form its unique headgear, said Dr Andrew Farke from the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology, who is the first author of a paper published in the open access journal PeerJ. Dinosaurs have yearly growth rings in their bone tissue, like trees. But we didnt see even one ring. That means it grew to a quarter of adult size in less than a year, added co author Dr Sarah Werning of Stony Brook University. The fossil skeleton has yielded previously unknown information about Parasaurolophus and its relatives. Medical scans documented the internal anatomy of the animals skull, allowing a reconstruction of its vocal capabilities. If adult Parasaurolophus had woofers, the babies had tweeters. The short and small crest of baby Joe shows that it may have had a much higher pitch to its call than did adults. Along with the visual differences, this might have helped animals living in the same area to figure out who was the big boss, Dr Farke said.

The fossil creature, named Alalcomenaeus, is the earliest known to show complete nervous system. Collected from the famous Chengjiang formation near Kunming in southwest China, the four eyed, 3 cm long Alalcomenaeus belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans large claws in Greek. These animals had an elongated, segmented body equipped with about a dozen pairs of body appendages enabling the animal to swim or crawl or both. All featured a pair of long, scissor like appendages attached to the head, most likely for grasping or sensory purposes. Alalcomenaeus solves the long standing mystery of where this group fits in the tree of life. It suggests that the ancestors of spiders, scorpions and their kin chelicerates branched off from the family tree of other arthropods  including insects, crustaceans and millipedes  more than half a billion years ago. We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to todays horseshoe crabs and scorpions. This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian, said Prof Nick Strausfeld from the University of Arizona, who is a senior author of a paper published in the journal Nature. Prof Strausfelds team analyzed the fossil by applying different imaging and image processing techniques, taking advantage of iron deposits that had selectively accumulated in the nervous system during fossilization. Some paleontologists had used the external appearance of the so called great appendage to infer that the megacheirans were related to chelicerates, based on the fact that the great appendage and the fangs of a spider or scorpion both have an elbow joint between their basal part and their pincer like tip, added study co author Dr Greg Edgecombe from Natural History Museum in London, UK. However, this wasnt rock solid because others lined up the great appendage either a segment in front of spider fangs or one segment behind them. We have now managed to add direct evidence from which segment the brain sends nerves into the great appendage. Its the second one, the same as in the fangs, or chelicerae. For the first time we can analyze how the segments of these fossil arthropods line up with each other the same way as we do with living species  using their nervous systems.

The unique fossil was found in the Middle Eocene Kishenehn Formation in northwestern Montana. The preservation of fossil female mosquito was an extremely improbable event, Dr Harbach with co authors wrote in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The insect had to take a blood meal, be blown to the waters surface, and sink to the bottom of a pond or similar lacustrine structure to be quickly embedded in fine anaerobic sediment, all without disruption of its fragile distended blood filled abdomen. The fossil was identified as an ancient species of Culiseta, a small mosquito genus that includes 37 extant species. This fossil has provided a unique opportunity to ask whether or not a portion of the hemoglobin molecule could be preserved after tens of millions of years. Using nondestructive mass spectrometry analysis, Dr Harbachs team detected organic molecules of heme the oxygen carrying group of blood component hemoglobin in the abdomen of the mosquito. The abdomen of the fossil mosquito is shown to contain very high levels of iron, and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry data provide unequivocal identification of porphyrin molecules. The combination of these two determinations indicates that the porphyrins are derived from the oxygen carrying heme moiety of hemoglobin, the researchers explained. Their findings show that although large and fragile molecules such as DNA cannot survive fossilization, other complex organic molecules such as iron stabilized heme can survive intact.

The exceptional preservation of the crab like fossil, which has extended the occurrence of sterols by 250 million years, is a consequence of early microbial encapsulation preventing full decomposition in the Devonian seas, explained Ines Melendez, who with colleagues reported the findings in Nature Scientific Reports. The coexistence of more than 70 steroids in one sample confirmed a proposed scheme for the transformation of biomolecules into geomolecules, reported in Science and Nature in 1982. However, we now know this was a microbially induced process rather than thermally driven one as previously assumed. Co author Prof Kliti Grice added their research demonstrates concretions within rocks were able to preserve biomolecules and geomolecules at remarkable levels. This opens up a novel window of opportunity to study such components in very ancient samples and improves our understanding of microbial evolution and past environmental conditions.

The extreme elongation of body axis occurred in one of two ways through the elongation of the individual vertebrae of the vertebral column or through the development of additional vertebrae and associated muscle segments. Unlike other known fish with elongate bodies, the vertebral column of Saurichthys does not have one vertebral arch per myomeric segment, but two, which is unique. This resulted in an elongation of the body and gave it an overall elongate appearance. This evolutionary pattern for body elongation is new, said Dr Erin Maxwell from the University of Zurich, lead author of the paper published in Nature Communications. Previously, we only knew about an increase in the number of vertebrae and muscle segments or the elongation of the individual vertebrae. According to Dr Maxwell and his colleagues, Saurichthys was certainly not as flexible as todays eels and, unlike modern oceanic fishes such as tuna, was probably unable to swim for long distances at high speed. Based upon its appearance and lifestyle, the roughly half meter long fish is most comparable to the garfish or needlefish that exist today.

This is an artists impression of the Upland Moa, Megalapteryx didinus, by George Edward Lodge, 1907. The coprolites of four moa species were excavated from a single rock at Daleys Flat in the Dart River Valley, the New Zealands South Island. Radio carbon dating revealed all four species inhabited the area at the same time between 1000 CE and 1400 CE. Analysis of the plant material in the fossils showed that South Island Giant Moa and Upland Moa ate a diet consisting of plants found both in forested areas and open grasslands, while the Heavy footed Moa stuck mainly to grassland fare and the Little Bush Moa lived up to is name by primary feeding in forest areas. The moa, which became extinct some 400 years ago, played an irreplaceable role in the ecosystem of New Zealand, said Dr Jamie Wood of Landcare Research, New Zealand, and colleagues, who reported the results in a paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It has been suggested that some extant herbivores could act as ecological surrogates for moa. Detailed information on the ecology of extinct species is critical for determining appropriate ecological surrogates, Our study shows that no extant herbivore tax, including other large ratites such as emu and ostrich, could replace the entire range of feeding ecologies exhibited by moa. The extinction of moa resulted in the irreplaceable loss of ecological function in New Zealands ecosystems, the paleontologists concluded.

The 12 million year old fossils  vertebrae and ribs  were discovered in the Selminum Tem cave in the Hindenburg Range, Western Province of Papua New Guinea, more than 30 years ago, but remained unstudied. Until now, Australasia didnt have a particularly ancient fossil record of sea cows, the group of marine mammals that includes our living dugongs, said Dr Erich Fitzgerald from Museum Victoria, who with colleagues described the fossils in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. The records only went back some five million years. Elsewhere in Asia, sea cow fossils are found in much older rocks, so it was always a mystery as to why the fossils hadnt been found in this part of the world. Now, with this one discovery, weve more than doubled the length of their evolutionary history in Australasian seas. The fossils provide a vital perspective on the relationship modern sea cows have with Australias northern marine ecosystems, Dr Fitzgerald said. Modern day dugongs are major consumers of sea grass, and, by doing so, have a tremendous impact on the structure of the ecosystem. They participate in a delicate balancing act their feeding allows diversity in sea grass and animal species that would otherwise be lacking. Previously, it was thought that sea cows were fairly new arrivals in Australasia, and that their relationship with sea grass ecosystems here was a recent event. This new evidence suggests sea cows have been an important component of Australasias marine ecosystems for at least 12 million years and that their role in the long term health of these environments may be substantial. The Miocene sea cow fossils are also the earliest mammal recorded from the island of New Guinea. "}, {"title": " Flowering Plants May Have Originated Earlier than Previously Thought", "author": "Natali Anderson", "date": "Oct 2, 2013", "doc": "Well preserved fossilized pollen grains found in northern Switzerland provide evidence that flowering plants may have originated in the early Triassic between 252 and 247 million years ago, or even earlier. Flowering plants evolved from extinct plants related to conifers, ginkgos, cycads, and seed ferns. The oldest known fossils from flowering plants are pollen grains. An uninterrupted sequence of fossilized pollen from flowers begins in the Early Cretaceous, about 140 million years ago, and it is generally assumed that flowering plants first evolved around that time. But a new study, published in the open access journal Frontiers in Plant Science, reports the discovery of flowering plant like pollen that is 100 million years older. Many studies have tried to estimate the age of flowering plants from molecular data, but so far no consensus has been reached. Depending on dataset and method, these estimates range from the Triassic to the Cretaceous. Molecular estimates typically need to be anchored in fossil evidence, but extremely old fossils were not available for flowering plants. That is why the present finding of flower like pollen from the Triassic is significant, said study co authors Dr Peter Hochuli and Dr Susanne Feist Burkhardt from the University of Z\u00fcrich. They studied two drilling cores from Weiach and Leuggern, northern Switzerland, and found 240 million year old pollen grains that resemble fossil pollen from the earliest known flowering plants. They obtained high resolution images across three dimensions of six different types of pollen. In a previous study, they documented different, but clearly related flowering plant like pollen from the Middle Triassic in cores from the Barents Sea, south of Spitsbergen. The samples from the present study were found 3,000 km south of the previous site. What might these primitive flowering plants have looked like? In the Middle Triassic, both the Barents Sea and Switzerland lay in the subtropics, but the area of Switzerland was much drier than the region of the Barents Sea. This implies that these plants occurred across a broad ecological range. The pollens structure suggests that the plants were pollinated by insects most likely beetles, as bees would not evolve for another 100 million years. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Find Oldest Evidence of Enrollment in Trilobites", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Sep 30, 2013", "doc": "Olenellids  an early group of trilobites  were able to roll themselves up defensively, according to Dr Javier Ortega Hern\u00e1ndez from the University of Cambridge and his colleagues. Among the first complex animals, trilobites lasted for over 270 million years and successfully adapted to a world that became more dangerous as predators increased. They were amongst the first sea dwelling creatures to develop ways to protect themselves, and their hard shells meant that their fossilized remains are abundant. Trilobites main defensive strategy was to roll up their bodies, like a modern day pill woodlouse, presenting potential predators with a heavily armored shield. Scientists have not been able to pinpoint when this important strategy originated, and until now it was generally believed that early forms of trilobites in the Cambrian Period  which began 545 million years ago  were simply not able to do it. But Dr Ortega Hern\u00e1ndezs team has now discovered that olenellids were able to enroll despite lacking many of the adaptations present in their younger relatives. This means that one of evolutions earliest defense mechanisms is in fact slightly over 510 million years old. The paleontologists have found two unusual fossils in Jasper National park in Alberta, Canada. The first specimen is unusual for an olenellid, as the tail covers the underside of the head completely  a typical characteristic of enrollment, Dr Ortega Hern\u00e1ndez said. The second shows overlapping segments in the body. Taken together, these are an exciting find, as it is clear evidence that, despite their limitations, olenellids were capable of rolling themselves up effectively. The seafloors which the olenellids inhabited were relatively predator free, so a simple ability to curl up would have been enough to avoid being eaten by the jawless fish and other organisms that shared their world, and also as a defense against harmful environments. This was during the Cambrian Explosion, when there was a rapid development in the complexity of life on Earth. But, as the evolutionary arms race stepped up over the next several million years, more effective defenses were needed, and trilobites developed body segments that slid more easily on top of each other, along with a larger tail shield that could completely cover the soft underside of their heads when they were enrolled. Most effectively of all, later trilobites developed various locking devices in their heads and tails which meant that, once rolled up, their bodies could not be pulled apart or twisted open. Its long been known that trilobites became very efficient at avoiding predators, and the fact that they fossilized easily means that there is rich and abundant record of them in both their outstretched and enrolled states, said Dr Ortega Hern\u00e1ndez, who is a lead author of a paper published in the Biology Letters. But no one had ever seen an enrolled fossil of this very early trilobite group known as olenellids, so it was assumed that they did not have enrolling ability at this stage of evolution. We now realize that this was because the olenellids capacity to enroll was relatively weak, at least compared to younger trilobites, meaning that when they died their muscles would relax and their bodies stretch out again. We needed to find olenellids that had been rapidly buried shortly after death and were still enrolled, and the Mural Formation in Alberta was the perfect place to find them.

The fossil has been collected from the Kuanti Formation near Qujing City, Yunnan Province. The fish, named Entelognathus primordialis, was a 20 cm long placoderm  an extinct class of armor plated fishes, the first known animals to evolve true jaws. Like other placoderms, Entelognathus had armored plates, but it also had more advanced jaw bones  features previously seen only in Osteichthyes bony fishes. The holotype specimen of Entelognathus was found in 2010, however a majority of the specimen was buried in the matrix in the field, explained Dr Min Zhu from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is a lead author of the paper reporting the discovery in the journal Nature. Before its preparation in the laboratory, we had not paid special attention to this specimen. Dr Zhu added that the careful lab work in 2011 unveiled its superb preservation for a compelling evidence of an osteichthyan like marginal jaw bones in a placoderm. If the jaws of Entelognathus were not articulated with the skull and trunk armor as many specimens from the same horizon, we probably assign them to an osteichthyan fish. According to the paleontologists, the discovery of Entelognathus provides evidence for the evolutionary link between placoderms and bony fishes, and adjusts the understanding of early evolution of gnathostomes jawed vertebrates. "}, {"title": " Paleontologists Discover Earliest Fossil Record of Lepidosaurs", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Sep 25, 2013", "doc": "Two skull fossils unearthed in Germany provide the first direct evidence that lepidosaurs  reptiles closely related to lizards, snakes and tuatara  were alive 240 million years ago during the Middle Triassic period. The fossils predate all other lepidosaur records by 12 million years. The Middle Triassic represents a time when the world has recovered from the Permian mass extinction but is not yet dominated by dinosaurs. This is also when familiar groups, such as frogs and lizards, may have first appeared, said Dr Marc Jones from the University College London, UK, who is a lead author of a paper reporting the discovery in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology. According to the study, the fossils are most closely related to the tuatara, a lizard like reptile. The small teeth and lightly built jaws suggest that the extinct animal preyed on small insects. Tuatara can be found on 35 islands lying off the coast of New Zealand and were recently reintroduced to the mainland. However, they are the sole survivors of a group that was once as globally widespread as lizards are today. Tuatara feed on beetles, spiders, crickets and small lizards, also enjoying the occasional sea bird. Today, there are over 9,000 species of lizards, snakes and tuatara. Knowing when the common ancestor of this grouping first appeared is crucial for understanding the ecological context in which it first evolved as well as its subsequent diversification. Dr Jones with colleagues used a dating technique known as a molecular clock to establish the age of the fossil remains. This method compares the amount of genetic divergence between living animals, caused by changes in their DNA sequences that have accumulated since they split from a common ancestor. These mutations occur fairly regularly, ticking along at a clock like rate. However, for the clock to convert genetic differences into geological time, it has to be calibrated using one or more fossils of known relationship and time. Molecular clocks have been used by biologists to answer questions as important as when the first modern humans emerged, and when humans and chimpanzees shared a common ancestor. The new fossil jaws can improve molecular dating estimates of when reptiles began to diversify into snakes, lizard and tuatara, and when the first modern lizards inhabited the earth. Previous estimates have varied over a range of 64 million years and the scientists are keen to help narrow this down. Some previous estimates based on molecular data suggested that lizards first evolved 290 million years ago. To a paleontologist this seems way too old and our revised molecular analysis agrees with the fossils, said study co author Dr Cajsa Lisa Anderson from the University of Gothenburg. Revised molecular dating in light of this new fossil find now suggests lizards began to diversify into most of the modern groups we recognize today, such as geckos and skinks, less than 150 million years ago in the Cretaceous period, following continental fragmentation.

The idea of recreating dinosaurs by extracting DNA from insects in amber has held the fascination of the public since the early 1990s. But Manchester University scientists in their new study, published in the open access journal PLoS ONE, have revealed this technique is unlikely to succeed. They used highly sensitive sequencing techniques  the most advance type of DNA sequencing  on insects in copal, the sub fossilized resin precursor of amber. The study was conducted wearing full forensic suits in an ancient DNA facility, which comprises a suite of independent, physically isolated laboratories, each with an ultra filtered air supply maintaining positive displacement pressure and a managed access system. In the original 1990s studies DNA amplification was achieved by a process called the polymerase chain reaction PCR, which will preferentially amplify any modern, undamaged DNA molecules that contaminate an extract of partially degraded ancient ones to give false positive results that might be mistaken for genuine ancient DNA, explained senior author Prof Terence Brown. Our approach, using next generation sequencing methods is ideal for ancient DNA because it provides sequences for all the DNA molecules in an extract, regardless of their length, and is less likely to give preference to contaminating modern molecules. The scientists concluded that their inability to detect ancient DNA in relatively young  60 years to 10,600 years old  sub fossilized insects in copal, despite using sensitive next generation methods, suggests that the potential for DNA survival in resin inclusions is no better, and perhaps worse, than that in air dried museum insects. This raises significant doubts about claims of DNA extraction from fossil insects in amber, many millions of years older than copal. Intuitively, one might imagine that the complete and rapid engulfment in resin, resulting in almost instantaneous demise, might promote the preservation of DNA in a resin entombed insect, but this appears not to be the case. So, unfortunately, the Jurassic Park scenario must remain in the realms of fiction, Dr Penney concluded.

The tulip tree, sometimes called tulip poplar or yellow poplar, is one of the largest trees of Eastern North America, sometimes reaching more than 150 feet in height. It is native from southern New England westward to Michigan and south to Louisiana and Florida. Prof Dilcher discovered fossil flowers and fruits resembling those of magnolias and tulip trees in 1975 in Kansas. He, along with colleagues, published information about the fossils and named the plant Archaeanthus. But the relationship between the fossils and any living plant species remained a mystery  until now. In a new study, Prof Dilcher with Dr Mikhail Romanov from the N. V. Tcitcin Main Botanical Garden, Russia, used advanced technologies of light, scanning electron and polarizing microscopy to develop a more detailed picture of the Archaeanthus flowers, fruits and seeds and compare them with the flowers, fruits and seeds of contemporary plants. Their results, published in the American Journal of Botany, suggest the tulip tree line diverged from magnolias more than 100 million years ago and constitutes an independent family, Liriodendraceae, with two living species one in the Eastern United States and the other in Eastern China. We discovered features of the fruits and seeds, not previously detailed, that were more similar to those of the tulip tree line of evolution than to the magnolias. Thus the beautiful tulip tree has a lineage that extends back to the age of the dinosaurs. It has a long, independent history separate from the magnolias and should be recognized as its own flowering plant family, Prof Dilcher explained. While the study provides new insight into the evolution of the tulip tree line, questions remain, Prof Dilcher said. Scientists dont know how widespread and various the early members of the tulip tree line may have been, for example. Fossils similar to Archaeanthus have been found in the Southeastern United States. Were there other similar plants, and where did they develop? Further, the fact that the tulip tree family has survived and evolved for more than 100 million years is relevant to understanding how species have developed in the past and how they might fare in the future given changing climate and other factors.

The cranium of juvenile Lufengpithecus lufengensis found at the site of Shuitangba Xue Ping Ji  Yunnan Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology. Juvenile crania of apes and hominins are extremely rare in the fossil record, especially those of infants and young juveniles. The Lufengpithecus fossil is only the second relatively complete cranium of a young juvenile in the entire Miocene record of fossil apes throughout the Old World, and both were discovered from the late Miocene of Yunnan Province. The cranium is also noteworthy for its age. It dates to near the end of the Miocene, a time when apes had become extinct in most of Eurasia. The fossils recovered from Shuitangba constitute one of the most important collections of late Miocene fossils brought to light in recent decades because they represent a snapshot from a critical transitional period in earth history, said Prof Nina Jablonski from Pennsylvania State University, a second author of the paper published in the Chinese Science Bulletin. The ape featured in the current paper typifies animals from the lush tropical forests that blanketed much of the worlds subtropical and tropical latitudes during the Miocene epoch, while the monkey and some of the smaller mammals exemplify animals from the more seasonal environments of recent times. In living ape species, cranial anatomy in individuals at the same stage of development as the new fossil cranium already show a close resemblance to those of adults. Therefore, the new cranium, despite being from a juvenile, gives researchers the best look at the cranial anatomy of Lufengpithecus lufengensis. Partly because of where and when Lufengpithecus lived, it is considered by most to be in the lineage of the extant orangutan, now confined to Southeast Asia but known from the late Pleistocene of southern China as well, said study senior author Dr Jay Kelley from Arizona State University. The Lufengpithecus cranium in frontal view, left, lateral view XuePing Ji et al. However, the Lufengpithecus cranium shows little resemblance to those of living orangutans, and in particular, shows none of what are considered to be key diagnostic features of orangutan crania. Lufengpithecus therefore appears to represent a late surviving lineage of Eurasian apes, but with no certain affinities yet clear. The survival of this lineage is not entirely surprising since southern China was less affected by climatic deterioration during the later Miocene that resulted in the extinction of many ape species throughout the rest of Eurasia. The team is hopeful that further excavations will produce the remains of adult individuals, which will allow them to better assess the relationships among members of this lineage as well as the relationships of this lineage to other fossil and extant apes.

Sting of Gondwanascorpio emzantsiensis RW Gess  University of the Witwatersrand. The animal, named Gondwanascorpio emzantsiensis, is a new species of scorpion that lived about 350 million years ago. Early life was confined to the sea and the process of terrestrialization  the movement of life onto land  began during the Silurian Period roughly 420 million years ago. The first wave of life to move out from water onto land consisted of plants, which gradually increased in size and complexity throughout the Devonian Period, said Dr Gess, who described Gondwanascorpio emzantsiensis in a paper published in the journal African Invertebrates. This initial colonization of land was closely followed by plant and debris eating invertebrate animals such as primitive insects and millipedes. By the end of the Silurian period about 416 million years ago, predatory invertebrates such as scorpions and spiders were feeding on the earlier colonists of land. By the Carboniferous period, early vertebrates  our four legged ancestors  had in turn left the water and were feeding on the invertebrates.

Leedsichtys problematicus Dmitry Bogdanov  CC BY 3.0. Leedsichthys was a huge bony, plankton eating fish that lived in the Middle Jurassic period around 165 million years ago. A number of skeletal remains of the creature have been uncovered over the years but havent preserved well, meaning no one was really sure just how large the fish could grow. To fill this gap, paleontologists from United Kingdom and Canada studied various remains of Leedsichthys, including a new specimen unearthed near Peterborough, UK. What we have demonstrated here is that a small adult Leedsichthys of 26  30 feet 8 9 m could reach that length within around 20 years, whereas after 38 years it would be around 54 feet 16.5 m long  possibly even outgrowing todays massive whale sharks, explained Prof Jeff Liston from National Museums Scotland, who with colleagues reported the findings in the volume Mesozoic Fishes 5 Global Diversity and Evolution. This fish was a pioneer for the ecological niche filled today by mammals, like blue whales, and cartilaginous fish, such as manta rays, basking sharks, whale sharks. Before then, vertebrate suspension feeders did not get larger than 1.6 feet 50 cm in length. Something important had changed.

The pig size Permian anomodont Dicynodon lacerticeps Marlene Donnelly  Field Museum of Natural History. The number of anomodont species increased during the Permian, sharply dropped during the end Permian extinction event, and then rebounded in the Middle Triassic Period before the final extinction of the group at the end of the Triassic, said study lead author Dr Marcello Ruta of the University of Lincoln. However, the variety of different anatomical features found in anomodonts  that is, their anatomical diversity  declined steadily over their history. Even in the aftermath of the mass extinction, when there should have been a lot of empty ecological space, anomodonts did not evolve any fundamentally new features. Rather than allowing them to move to a new evolutionary trajectory, the genetic bottleneck they passed through constrained their future evolution. The response of animals and plants to the end Permian mass extinction helps researchers understand models of diversification and patterns of ecosystem reconstruction following large scale biological crises. This is the first study of its kind to address simultaneously changes in species number and anatomical diversity in anomodonts, and to quantify their response to the most catastrophic extinction on record. Anomodonts are abundant, diverse, and well studied, which makes them ideal models for evolutionary analyses, explained study senior author Prof Michael Benton from the University of Bristol. The results underscore that recoveries from mass extinctions can be unpredictable, a finding that has important implications for the species extinctions being caused by human activity in the world today.

The fossil provides evidence that hair and fur originated well before the rise of the first true mammals. Life reconstruction of Megaconus mammaliaformis. It was a nocturnal animal, foraging mostly in the night April Isch  Zhe Xi Luo  University of Chicago. Megaconus mammaliaformis is one of the best preserved fossils of the mammaliaform groups, which are long extinct relatives to modern mammals. We finally have a glimpse of what may be the ancestral condition of all mammals, by looking at what is preserved in Megaconus. It allows us to piece together poorly understood details of the critical transition of modern mammals from pre mammalian ancestors, explained Prof Zhe Xi Luo from the University of Chicago, who is a lead author of a paper describing the discovery in the journal Nature. Megaconus co existed with feathered dinosaurs in the Jurassic era, nearly 100 million years before Tyrannosaurus rex roamed our planet. Preserved in the fossil is a clear halo of guard hairs and underfur residue, making Megaconus only the second known pre mammalian fossil with fur. It was found with sparse hairs around its abdomen, leading the team to hypothesize that it had a naked abdomen. On its heels, Megaconus possessed a long keratinous spur, which was possibly poisonous. Similar to spurs found on modern egg laying mammals, such as male platypuses, the spur is evidence that this fossil was most likely a male member of its species. Prof Luo said Megaconus confirms that many modern mammalian biological functions related to skin and integument had already evolved before the rise of modern mammals. Megaconus mammaliaformis fossil. The preserved part of the skeleton, from head to rump, is about 8 inches April Isch  Zhe Xi Luo  University of Chicago. Megaconus, a terrestrial animal about the size of a large ground squirrel, is estimated to weigh about 0.25 kg. It was likely an omnivore, possessing clearly mammalian dental features and jaw hinge. Its molars had elaborate rows of cusps for chewing on plants, and some of its anterior teeth possessed large cusps that allowed it to eat insects and worms, perhaps even other small vertebrates. It had teeth with high crowns and fused roots similar to more modern, but unrelated, mammalian species such as rodents. Its high crowned teeth also appeared to be slow growing like modern placental mammals. The skeleton of Megaconus, especially its hind leg bones and finger claws, likely gave it a gait similar to modern armadillos, a previously unknown type of locomotion in mammaliaforms. However, the paleontologists identified clearly non mammalian characteristics as well. Its primitive middle ear, still attached to the jaw, was reptile like. Its anklebones and vertebral column are also similar to the anatomy of previously known mammal like reptiles. We cannot say that Megaconus is our direct ancestor, but it certainly looks like a great great grand uncle 165 million years removed. These features are evidence of what our mammalian ancestor looked like during the Triassic Jurassic transition, Prof Luo said.

The structures, measuring 30 to 60 cm high and 60 to 120 cm wide, are calcium carbonate rich deposits of different types and shapes emerging as cones from the clayey sediment. Their color varies from yellowish to red or whitish to light gray. The paleontologists identified these 1.75 million year old structures as fossilized ambergris. Ambergris is a solid, waxy, gray or blackish flammable substance usually associated with sperm whales Physeter macrocephalus and rarely with pygmy sperm whales Kogia breviceps. It can be found floating upon the sea, or lying on the coast. Amergris, also known as the floating gold, has been a popular perfume ingredient since ancient times. It possesses a complex scent, described as musky, sweet and earthy. Currently, highest quality ambergris is sold for up to 20,000 USD per kg.

The structures show several important similarities with contemporary ambergris masses the overall forms and striation of the structures the presence of fossil squid beaks and the presence of organic molecules derived from mammalian gastric activity and from the alteration of squid beaks, Dr Sassi and her co authors wrote in a paper published in the journal Geology. The discovery of these masses of ambergris increases our knowledge of the distribution and activity of sperm whales in the ancient Tyrrhenian Sea 1.75 million years ago. The Allerona site, exhibiting a very high concentration of sperm whale coprolites, is the first fossil documentation of sperm whale ambergris anywhere in the world, the authors concluded.

Archaeopteryx lithographica, one of the earliest known birds Carl Buell  Nicholas Longrich. Archaeopteryx has always been set up as a uniquely transitional species between feathered dinosaurs and modern birds, a halfway point. But by studying the cranial volume of closely related dinosaurs, we learned that Archaeopteryx might not have been so special, said first author Dr Amy Balanoff of the American Museum of Natural History. Using CT scanners, the team peered inside the braincases of more than twenty specimens, including modern birds, Archaeopteryx, and closely related non avian dinosaurs. By stitching together the CT scans, they created 3D reconstructions of the skulls interiors. In addition to calculating the total volume of each digital brain cast, they also determined the size of each brains major anatomical regions, including the olfactory bulbs, cerebrum, optic lobes, cerebellum, and brain stem. The story of brain size is more than its relationship to body size. If we also consider how the different regions of the brain changed relative to each other, we can gain insight into what factors drove brain evolution as well as what developmental mechanisms facilitated those changes, said co author Dr Gabriel Bever from the New York Institute of Technology.

Several other non avian dinosaurs, including bird like oviraptorosaurs and troodontids, actually had larger brains relative to body size than Archaeopteryx. Dr Balanoff said if Archaeopteryx had a flight ready brain, which is almost certainly the case given its morphology, then so did at least some other non avian dinosaurs.

The origin of vertebrates, over a time scale from roughly 700 to 400 million years ago. The red curve indicates our direct ancestors, beginning with early metazoans, and the numbers along the curve denote major branchings that are significant to the evolution of the vertebrate eye Trevor D. Lamb Prof Lamb said that the eyes are one of our most remarkable and precious organs, yet their origins have been shrouded in mystery until quite recently. There are profound questions about the eye which are still not easy to answer because it appeared so very long ago. Why did the eye develop? Why are there many different kinds of eye, including one for insects and crustaceans  and one for vertebrates like us? The deep origins of sight go back more than 700 million years when the earth was inhabited only by single celled amoeba like animals, algae, corals and bacteria. At this time the first light sensitive chemicals, known as opsins, made their appearance and were used in rudimentary ways by some organisms to sense day from night. Over the following 200 million years those simple light sensitive cells and their opsins slowly and progressively became better at detecting light until around 500 million years ago they already closely resembled the cone cells of our present day eyes. Prof Lamb, who published the review in the journal Progress in Retinal and Eye Research, explained that the first true eyes, consisting of clumps of light sensing cells, only start to show up in the Cambrian, about 500 million years ago  and represent a huge leap in the evolutionary arms race. For example there is Anomalocaris, a meter long predator like a giant scorpion which had eyes the size of marbles, with which to navigate the ancient seas and locate its prey. This beast, which employed the insect eye model with many facets, had no fewer than 16,000 facets containing vision cells, in each eye. This generates an avalanche of information, known as optic flow, running from the eyes and along the creatures nervous system. This all has to be processed, so we also begin to see the rapid development of a central nervous system able to cope with such immense amounts of data, continually provided by the eyes and other sensory organs from the world around the animal. For the first time animals begin to see the complex landscape which they inhabit. Our type of eye, a single globe packing in millions of photoreceptors, first starts to emerge between 500 600 million years ago. This was the crucial moment for our vision system. Baby sea squirts have a simple eyespot called an ocellus, which is basically a bundle of photoreceptors. The adult animal loses this, as it becomes immobile, so vision is not important. This organ appears to date back at least 600 million years. The hagfish has a patch of translucent skin on each side of the head where youd expect to see its eyes, and buried beneath are a pair of very simple eyes with light sensing cells and a simple optic nerve  but no muscles, lens or iris. Hagfish ancestors go back more than half a billion years, so this crude light sensing organ seems to have been the start of something big. Lampreys also appeared around 500 million years ago, and have a pair of camera style eyes remarkably similar to our own. These appear to be direct forerunners of the vertebrate eye, which we have inherited through our fish ancestry. From this we can say that the vertebrate style eye has been around at least 500 million years  and although its light sensors and signaling systems are very similar to those of insects and other invertebrates, its optical system evolved quite independently from the insect style eye with its many facets.

Oreopithecus bambolii \u00a9 Museo di Storia Naturale della Maremma Our findings offer new insight into the Oreopithecus locomotor debate, said lead author Dr Gabrielle Russo of the University of Texas at Austin. While its certainly possible that Oreopithecus bambolii walked on two legs to some extent, as apes are known to employ short bouts of this activity, an increasing amount of anatomical evidence clearly demonstrates that it didnt do so habitually. Dr Russo and her colleague Dr Liza Shapiro, also from the University of Texas at Austin analyzed Oreopithecus fossils to see whether the ape possessed lower spine anatomy consistent with bipedal walking. They compared measurements of its lumbar vertebrae and sacrum  a triangular bone at the base of the spine  to those of modern humans, fossil hominins, and a sample of mammals that commonly move around in trees, including apes, sloths and an extinct lemur. The lower spine serves as a good basis for testing the habitual bipedal locomotion hypothesis because human lumbar vertebrae and sacra exhibit distinct features that facilitate the transmission of body weight for habitual bipedalism, Dr Russo said. The study shows that the anatomy of Oreopithecus lumbar vertebrae and sacrum is unlike that of humans, and more similar to apes, indicating that it is incompatible with the functional demands of walking upright as a human does.

Fouldenia is shown swimming along the bottom of a tropical freshwater floodplain about 348 million years ago John Megahan Fouldenia first appears in the fossil record a mere 11 million years after an extinction event that ended the Devonian Era and wiped out more than 90 percent of the planets vertebrate species. This event 359 million years ago is called the Hangenberg extinction, and it nearly wiped out vertebrate life, which at the time was limited to the water, said lead author Dr Lauren Sallan from the University of Michigan and the University of Chicago. Fouldenia and a handful of its relatives demonstrate that in the immediate aftermath of the end Devonian extinction, ray finned fish had already acquired a diversity of forms that gave them an evolutionary edge, enabling them to fill the ecological vacuum left by the demise of most major fish groups. The ray finned fish come to the fore after that event. They not only recover from this extinction, but they go from being a few minor lineages to dominating all the oceans. Skull fossil of Fouldenia Lauren Cole Sallan  Michael I. Coates FLS Dr Sallan and his colleague Dr Michael Coates of the University of Chicago were able to identify juveniles of Fouldenia, a rare find that allowed them to show that the body shape of these fish changed dramatically as they developed. The relatives of Fouldenia, shell crushers all, apparently took advantage of this developmental quirk to produce new forms. This diverse band of survivors spread worldwide and persisted for nearly 100 million years. There are around 30 thousand species of ray finned fish today, comprising nearly 99 percent of all fish species. Think of the word fish and the image that pops into your mind will likely be a ray finned fish, members of a ubiquitous class that includes everything from tuna to trout, catfish to cod, swordfish to sunfish, perch to piranha, goldfish to goby. After re evaluating fossils from sites in Scotland dating to 348 million years ago, the scientists concluded that Fouldenia and its relative Styracopterus, which previous researchers had classified as the same species, are in fact separate genera. A genus is the category of biological classification between the family and the species. They determined that Fouldenia had massive tooth plates on its upper and lower jaws, suitable for preying on hard shelled animals. It resembled modern day jacks, which include the Japanese amberjack, or yellowtail, familiar to sushi lovers. Styracopterus was an early mimic of modern deep bodied fish such as the angelfish. Both of these primeval fish were less than 10 inches long. Styracopterus, a later relative of Fouldenia that appeared alongside a host of fish with new body forms about 338 million years ago, is shown at a near shore reef John Megahan Those Scottish fossil beds have four or five known genera of ray finned fish in them. They all look completely different, and they all do completely different things, Dr Sallan said. Before the Hangenberg extinction, fish were dominated by two groups the armor plated, predatory placoderms and the lobe finned fish, whose fins are borne on a fleshy, scaly stalk extending from the body. Placoderms were eliminated by the extinction, and most of the lobe finned fish perished as well, though survivors live on today in the lungfish and the coelacanth. In addition to a few ray finned fish, some sharks and tetrapods survived the event. Other survivors of the event included sea urchins, sea lilies and shelled invertebrates called brachiopods. With most other predators now out of the picture, early sharks and ray finned fish like Fouldenia used their crushing jaws to dine on these spiny, stalked and hard shelled creatures. Because the ecosystems been decimated, the only thing left to prey on are shelly animals. So in this vacuum left by the mass extinction event, a bunch of different animals are going into these vacated niches and taking over those jobs, Dr Sallan concluded.

Only known specimen of the Early Eocen marsupial Archaeonothos henkgodthelpi from southeastern Queensland, Australia scale bar  1mm Robin M.D. Beck The origins of Australian marsupials suddenly got a lot more complicated, said Dr Robin Beck from the University of New South Wales. One of the fossils, found at the Tingamarra site in southeastern Queensland, is a 55 million year old ankle bone from a mouse sized marsupial previously known only from South America. All the species of modern day marsupials here are quite closely related. The species represented by the ankle bone belongs to an entirely different group  a group that we know lived in South America but, up until now, we thought never made it to Australia. The second is a tooth, which derives from a formerly unknown species that shows similarities to fossils found in South America and, surprisingly, North Africa. The tooth is more of a mystery are its origins in South America, Africa or somewhere else? said Dr Beck, who described this fossil in a study published online in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. The two fragments are set to overturn the conventional theory about the evolution of marsupials, which holds that there was a single migration from the part of the Gondwana supercontinent that became South America to the part that became Australia. It is impossible to explain the presence of these new fossils in Australia using the single dispersal model. Instead, there may have been multiple movements of marsupials between South America and Australia. Because the fossil tooth comes from a species previously unknown to science, Dr Beck had the honor of formally describing and naming it. Ive named it after one of my colleagues, Dr Henk Godthelp, who has led research at Tingamarra together with Mike Archer and Sue Hand. Henks nickname is The Old Bastard, so Ive called the species Archaeonothos henkgodthelpi, which translates, roughly, to the ancient illegitimate of Henk Godthelp. The name also implies the species is unrelated to other Australian marsupials. The similarities between the fossil tooth and those of an extinct species recorded in Tunisia remain the tantalizing subject of further research. For the moment, though, Dr Beck thinks the tooth and the ankle bone  which he described in the German journal Naturwissenschaften  provide fascinating new information about the history of marsupials in Australia.

Bright, irregularly shaped structures are Diskagma buttonii Gregory J. Retallack et al New evidence involves very small fossils connected into bunches by threads in the surface of an ancient soil from Hekpoort Formation near Waterval Onder, South Africa. They have been named Diskagma buttonii, meaning disc shaped fragments of Andy Button, but it is unsure what the fossils were, explained lead author Prof Gregory Retallack of the University of Oregon. They certainly were not plants or animals, but something rather more simple. Diskagma buttonii are very small  about 0.3  1.8 mm long. They most resemble modern soil organisms called Geosiphon, a fungus with a central cavity filled with symbiotic cyanobacteria. Prof Retallack said that there is independent evidence for cyanobacteria, but not fungi, of the same geological age, and these new fossils set a new and earlier benchmark for the greening of the land. This gains added significance because fossil soils hosting the fossils have long been taken as evidence for a marked rise in the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere at about 2.4 billion to 2.2 billion years ago, widely called the Great Oxidation Event. By modern standards, in which Earths air is now 21 percent oxygen, this early rise was modest, to about 5 percent oxygen, but it represented a rise from vanishingly low oxygen levels earlier in geological time. Prof Retallack added demonstrating that Diskagma are fossils was a technical triumph because they were too big to be completely seen in a standard microscopic slide and within rock that was too dark to see through in slabs. The images enabled a three dimensional restoration of the fossils form odd little hollow urn shaped structures with a terminal cup and basal attachment tube. Reconstruction of Diskagma buttonii Gregory J. Retallack et al At last we have an idea of what life on land looked like in the Precambrian. Perhaps with this search image in mind, we can find more and different kinds of fossils in ancient soils. Newly named fossil Diskagma is comparable in morphology and size to Thucomyces lichenoides, a fossil dating to 2.8 billion years ago and also found in South Africa, but its composition, including interior structure and trace elements, is significantly different. The new fossil is a promising candidate for the oldest known eukaryote  an organism with cells that contain complex structures, including a nucleus, within membranes, Prof Retallack and his colleagues concluded.

Reconstruction of the pachycephalosaurid Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis with cranial lesion Peterson JE et al Paleontologists have heavily debated for several decades the adaptive significance of pachycephalosaurid domes. Some suggested that they are the product of sexual selection as an adaptation for species recognition, others that they are weapon employed in intraspecific combat. There are two primary hypotheses proposed to explain dome function, study lead author Dr Joseph Peterson from the University of Wisconsin and his colleagues explained in a paper published in the open access journal PLoS ONE. The first suggests the dome was a display structure, and acted either as a sexually selected display or for species recognition. These explanations are problematic because the dome requires a very high investment of material for a display structure, and because the gross similarity in dome shape between different species, as well as extraordinary changes in shape between juveniles and adults, would have made the dome relatively ineffective for species recognition. The second hypothesis suggests the domes structure served a mechanical function, specifically, that the thickened dome was used in intraspecific agonistic bouts, with pachycephalosaurids butting flanks or heads. The hypothesis that the dome functioned as a weapon is supported by a number of lines of evidence. To test the second hypothesis, Dr Petersons team examined the distribution and frequency of pathologies in skulls and skull domes of pachycephalosaurids. Hypothetical head to head interactions among pachycephalosaurids. Top bison like head shoving in large, broad domed specimens such as Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis. Center ovis like clashing in Prenocephale prenes. Bottom capra style broadside butting in high domed and large horned specimens such as subadult Pachycephalosaurus Peterson JE et al The examination of 109 domes from over 14 dinosaur species revealed an extraordinary high incidence of pathology. Approximately one fifth of all domes have lesions that are consistent with osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis can result from a number of different processes, but the most likely one in this context is trauma to the skull, with damage to the tissue overlying the skull leading to an infection of the bone tissue. The high frequency of pathology seen in pachycephalosaurids is, therefore, consistent with the hypothesis that the dome was employed in intraspecific combat. It is also difficult to explain in any other context. The scientists found more support for the head butting hypothesis by looking at extant head butting mammals. They examined 30 skeletons of bovid species such as domestic goats, bighorn and dall sheep, American bisons, to explore the distribution of healed fractures and lesions. Comparisons with injuries in extant bovids illustrate the variation in injury and lesion distribution related to behavior and suggest that the distribution of injuries in extinct animals can therefore be similarly used to infer behavior in extinct taxa, they wrote.

Reconstruction of Ocepechelon bouyai Bardet N et al  C. Letenneur  MNHN  CC BY The newly discovered turtle, named Ocepechelon bouyai, is one of the biggest marine turtles that ever lived on Earth, according to a study published in the open access journal PLoS ONE. The generic name Ocepechelon derives from an acronym for the Groupe Office Ch\u00e9rifien des Phosphates, the mining company exploiting phosphatic deposits in Morocco, and from the Greek word chelone turtle. The specific name honors Ba\u00e2di Bouya, engineer geologist and head of the OCP Geological Survey in Khouribga, for his help during fieldworks. Ocepechelon is known from an almost complete 28 inch long 70 cm skull found in Sidi Chennane area in Moroccos Khouribga Province. Its striking anatomy suggests the turtle was adapted for suction feeding, never seen in known turtles. The feeding apparatus of Ocepechelon, a bony pipette like snout, is unique among tetrapods, the authors wrote in the paper. Skull of Ocepechelon bouyai Bardet N et al Ocepechelon shares interesting resemblances with beaked whales. Ocepechelon and most beaked whales are large animals, and, as in all other extant cetaceans and Ocepechelon, the nostrils of beaked whales are posterodorsally shifted. They also share similarities on their feeding apparatus elongated jaws and a small gape. The mouth gape of Ocepechelon can be inferred from the diameter of the tube  about 2.5 inches 6 cm. It is worth emphasizing the disproportion between the tiny size of the mouth opening and the large size of the Ocepechelons skull. The snout diameter shows that Ocepechelon was a small prey hunter and may have fed on small fishes, cephalopods and jellyfishes. In pipefishes the snout length is inversely related to the mouth cross section and is considered as an evolutionary advantage since it reduces the time to reach the prey. In Ocepechelon, the elongated rostrum and the round and small mouth much likely increased the velocity of the water influx, the scientists explained.

This image shows different dinosaur species, left to right Chasmosaurus belli, Lambeosaurus lambei, Styracosaurus albertensis, Euoplocephalus tutus, Prosaurolophus maximus, Panoplosaurus mirus and a herd of S. albertensis in the background \u00a9 J.T. Csotonyi Prof Roger Seymour argues that cold blooded dinosaurs would not have had the required muscular power to prey on other animals and dominate over mammals as they did throughout the Mesozoic period. The biologist says that much can be learned about dinosaurs from fossils but the question of whether dinosaurs were warm blooded or cold blooded is still hotly debated among scientists. Some point out that a large saltwater crocodile can achieve a body temperature above 30 degrees Celsius by basking in the sun, and it can maintain the high temperature overnight simply by being large and slow to change temperature. They say that large, cold blooded dinosaurs could have done the same and enjoyed a warm body temperature without the need to generate the heat in their own cells through burning food energy like warm blooded animals. The scientist asks how much muscular power could be produced by a crocodile like dinosaur compared to a mammal like dinosaur of the same size. Saltwater crocodiles reach over a tone in weight and, being about 50 per cent muscle, have a reputation for being extremely powerful animals. But drawing from blood and muscle lactate measurements, Prof Seymour shows that a 200 kg crocodile can produce only about 14 per cent of the muscular power of a mammal at peak exercise, and this fraction seems to decrease at larger body sizes. The results further show that cold blooded crocodiles lack not only the absolute power for exercise, but also the endurance, that are evident in warm blooded mammals. So, despite the impression that saltwater crocodiles are extremely powerful animals, a crocodile like dinosaur could not compete well against a mammal like dinosaur of the same size. Dinosaurs dominated over mammals in terrestrial ecosystems throughout the Mesozoic. To do that they must have had more muscular power and greater endurance than a crocodile like physiology would have allowed, concludes Prof Seymour, who presented his findings in the open access journal PLoS ONE.

Nasutoceratops titusi University of Utah The newly discovered dinosaur, named Nasutoceratops titusi, belongs to a group of big bodied horned dinosaurs called ceratopsids, the same family as the famous Triceratops. More specifically, they are members of the subset of ceratopsids known as centrosaurines, with Avaceratops being the closest known relative within this smaller subset of horned dinosaurs. Nasutoceratops fossils were unearthed in Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, which encompasses 1.9 million acres of high desert terrain in south central Utah. This herbivorous dinosaur was about 15 feet 5 m long and weighed 2.5 tones. Nasutoceratops had several unique features, including an oversized nose relative to other members of the family, and exceptionally long, curving, forward oriented horns over the eyes. The bony frill, rather than possessing elaborate ornamentations such as hooks or spikes, is relatively unadorned, with a simple, scalloped margin. Nasutoceratops translates as big nose horned face, and the specific name titusi honors Alan Titus, Monument Paleontologist at Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, for his years of research collaboration. The jumbo sized schnoz of Nasutoceratops likely had nothing to do with a heightened sense of smell  since olfactory receptors occur further back in the head, adjacent to the brain  and the function of this bizarre feature remains uncertain, said Dr Scott Sampson, the Vice President of Research and Collections at the Denver Museum of Nature  Science and lead author of a paper reporting the discovery in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Nasutoceratops skull and skeletal reconstruction Scott D. Sampson et al Researchers have long speculated about the function of horns and frills on horned dinosaurs. Ideas have ranged from predator defense and controlling body temperature to recognizing members of the same species. Yet the dominant hypothesis today focuses on competing for mates  that is, intimidating members of the same sex and attracting members of the opposite sex. Peacock tails and deer antlers are modern examples. The amazing horns of Nasutoceratops were most likely used as visual signals of dominance and, when that wasnt enough, as weapons for combatting rivals, said co author Dr Mark Loewen from the Natural History Museum of Utah and the University of Utahs Department of Geology and Geophysics.

Fossil of a newly discovered family of extinct scorpionflies from Canada Archibald SB et al The new insect family has been named Eorpidae after the Eocene Epoch, the age when these insects lived some 50 million years ago. A study describing Eorpidae has been published in the Journal of Paleontology full paper in .pdf. The Eorpidae was part of a cluster of six closely related families in the Eocene, but today this group is reduced to two. Why were these different? We believe the answer may lay in a combination of two large scale challenges that would have hit them hard the evolutionary diversification of a strong competitive group and global climate change, said study first author Dr Bruce Archibald from Simon Fraser University. In a major evolutionary diversification, ants evolved from a small group to become major ecological players in the Eocene, now competing with these scorpionflies for the same food resource in a whole new, efficient manner. Global climates were much warmer 50 million years ago, associated with increased atmospheric carbon, a relationship that scientists see today. Along with this, winters were mild, even in the cool, higher elevations where these insects lived. Average temperatures there were similar to modern Vancouver, but with fewif anyfrost days. When climates outside of the tropics later cooled, temperature seasonality also widened, forming the modern pattern of hot summers and freezing winters. Plant and animal groups that inhabited Eocene uplands either had to evolve tolerance for colder winters, migrate to the hot tropics and adapt to that climate, or go extinct. These scorpionfly families appear to have retained their need to inhabit cooler climates, but to persist there, they would need to evolve toleration for cold winters, a feat that only the two surviving families may have accomplished, Dr Archibald said. Understanding the evolutionary history of these insects adds another piece to the puzzle of how animal communities change as climate does  but in this case, when an interval of global warming ends.

Thylacosmilus atrox with glyptodon and toxodonts in the background Rom diz Thylacosmilus looked and behaved like nothing alive today, said lead author Dr Stephen Wroe, a paleontologist with the University of New South Wales. To achieve a kill the animal must have secured and immobilized large prey using its extremely powerful forearms, before inserting the saber teeth into the windpipe or major arteries of the neck  a mix of brute force and delicate precision. The iconic North American saber toothed tiger, Smilodon fatalis, is often regarded as the archetypal mammalian super predator. However, Smilodon  a true cat  was just the end point in one of at least five independent experiments in saber tooth evolution through the Age of Mammals, which spanned some 65 million years. Thylacosmilus atrox is the best preserved species of one of these evolutionary lines  pouched saber tooths that terrorized South America until around 3.5 million years ago. For its size, its huge canine teeth were larger than those of any other known saber tooth. Smilodons killing behavior has long attracted controversy, but paleontologists now mostly agree that powerful neck muscles, as well as jaw muscles, played an important role in driving the saber teeth into the necks of large prey. Little was known about the predatory behavior in the pouched Thylacosmilus. Dr Wroe with colleagues constructed and compared sophisticated computer models of Smilodon and Thylacosmilus, as well as a living conical toothed cat, the leopard. These models were digitally crash tested in simulations of biting and killing behavior. We found that both saber tooth species were similar in possessing weak jaw muscle driven bites compared to the leopard, but the mechanical performance of the saber tooths skulls showed that they were both well adapted to resist forces generated by very powerful neck muscles, Dr Wroe explained. But compared to the placental Smilodon, Thylacosmilus was even more extreme. Frankly, the jaw muscles of Thylacosmilus were embarrassing. With its jaws wide open this 80 100 kg super predator had a bite less powerful than a domestic cat. On the other hand  its skull easily outperformed that of the placental Smilodon in response to strong forces from hypothetical neck muscles. Bottom line is that the huge sabers of Thylacosmilus were driven home by the neck muscles alone and  because the saber teeth were actually quite fragile  this must have been achieved with surprising precision. It may not have been the smartest of mammalian super predators  but in terms of specialization  Thylacosmilus took the already extreme saber tooth lifestyle to a whole new level, Dr Wroe concluded.

Carbon dating has shown that the fossils are about 1,970 years old. The paleontologists have named the new species Otus frutuosoi in honor of the 16th century Azorean historian Gaspar Frutuoso. According to a paper published in the journal Zootaxa, Otus frutuosoi is closely related to the European scops owl. It went extinct soon after people reached the Azores in the 15th century. Humans have a history of changing island ecosystems. When humans arrived on the island mice started to appear and laurisilva  a type of humid forest  was destroyed. This surely played a large part in the extinction of the S\u00e3o Miguel scops owl, Dr Alcover explained to SINC. The body of the extinct scops owl of the Azores was shorter and wider than that of its modern day European relatives. Its beak was short and small, similar to that of the nightjar. Having long legs and very short wings, it must have been a very poor flyer and thus more of a land dwelling bird, he said.

Artists rendering of Bunostegos Marc Boulay During the Permian era, our planet was dominated by a single supercontinent called Pangaea. Animal and plant life dispersed broadly across the continent, as documented by identical fossil species found on multiple modern continents. In the Republic of Niger, Dr Ides team has recently unearthed pareiasaur fossils belonging to the genus Bunostegos, which means knobby roof. Pareiasaurs were herbivorous reptiles that were common across Pangaea during the Middle and Late Permian about 266  252 million years ago. Imagine a cow sized, plant eating reptile with a knobby skull and bony armor down its back, said Dr Linda Tsuji from the University of Washington, who is a lead author of the study published in the current issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Most pareiasaurs had bony knobs on their skulls, but Bunostegos sported the largest, most bulbous ones ever discovered. In life, these were probably skin covered horns like those on the heads of modern giraffes. Although at first blush these features seem to suggest that Bunostegos was an evolutionarily advanced pareiasaur, it also had many primitive characteristics. The teams analysis showed that Bunostegos was actually more closely related to older and more primitive pareiasaurs, leading to two conclusions first, that its knobby noggin was the result of convergent evolution, and second, that its genealogical lineage had been isolated for millions of years. So how do you isolate a population of cow sized reptiles? Though there were no fences in the Permian, climatic conditions conspired to corral Bunostegos  along with several other reptiles, amphibians, and plants  and keep them constrained to the central area of the supercontinent. Our work supports the theory that central Pangaea was climatically isolated, allowing a unique relict fauna to persist into the Late Permian, said co author Dr Christian Sidor, also from the University of Washington. This is surprising because areas outside this central region show fossil evidence of regular faunal interchange. Bibliographic information Linda A. Tsuji et al. 2013.

Fossilized scales and bones of Machaeracanthus were found in Teruel, south of Zaragoza, Spain. The discovery of this new species, which we call Machaeracanthus goujeti and belongs to the Acanthodii group, expands our knowledge of the biodiversity that existed on the peninsula 480 million years ago, when the modern day region of Teruel was covered by the sea, said Prof H\u00e9ctor Botella from the University of Valencia, lead author of a paper desribing the new species in the journal Geodiversitas. The paleontologists estimate that adult Machaeracanthus goujeti were not more than 3.3 feet 1 m long.

The results suggest that these prehistoric animals occupied specialized dietary niches and did not rely on identical sources of food. For example, the extinct kangaroo ate plants similar to those consumed by present day kangaroos in temperate and tropical regions, rather than the plants that now grow in this region. This period, the Pliocene, is critical to understand the origins and evolution of Australias unique modern animals, said Dr Price and colleagues, who report their results in the open access journal PLoS ONE. It is during this time that the Australian fauna first began to take on its modern appearance and distinctiveness, with many modern Australian marsupials, such as the agile wallaby Macropus gracilis, first appearing in Pliocene fossil deposits. The findings also suggest that southeastern Queensland hosted a mosaic of tropical forests, wetlands and grasslands during the Pliocene. It is vital for us to understand what types of environments Australian megafauna thrived in during the Pliocene. Obtaining detailed environmental records from this time can help us find the drivers of the subsequent extinctions of many of these large marsupials, added lead author Dr Shaena Montanari from the American Museum of Natural History.

Reconstruction of Aurornis xui Emiliano Troco Its an important fossil. Aurornis pushes Archaeopteryx off its perch as the oldest member of the bird lineage, said Dr Gareth Dyke from the University of Southamptons Ocean and Earth Science, senior author of the study published in the journal Nature. Aurornis xui lived during the Middle Late Jurassic period around 160 million years ago. It was about 50 cm from its beak to the tip of its tail  the size of a pheasant. It had a long tail and claws with legs similar to Archaeopteryx but some of its features were much more primitive. Encased in sedimentary rock, the Aurornis fossil preserved traces of downy feathers along the animals tail, neck and chest, but the absence of larger feathers suggests it was not able to fly. The generic name Aurornis is derived from the Latin word aurora, meaning daybreak, and the Greek word ornis for bird. The specific name xui honors the paleontologist Xu Xing. Aurornis fossil Pascal Godefroit et al That the new species trumps Archaeopteryx as the oldest known bird is significant because when it was discovered in Germany in 1861, Archaeopteryx came to be seen as the first proof that birds evolved from dinosaurs and was the first fossil to support Darwins theory of evolution, which was published around the same time. With the find of Aurornis xui, Archaeopteryx is again considered an ancestor of birds and the new creature we describe is also a basal bird and in fact it is even more primitive than Archaeopteryx, explained study lead author Dr Pascal Godefroit of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. The Aurornis discovery also reclassified the status of Troodontidae, a family of bird like dinosaurs. Paleontologists now consider this dinosaur family to be a sister group of the avians. The new species is certainly an older member of the bird lineage than Archaeopteryx, and its fair to call it a very primitive bird. But what you call a bird comes down to what you call a bird, and a lot of definitions depend on Archaeopteryx, said study co author Dr Paul Barrett from the Natural History Museum in London, UK.

Spindle like plankton microfossils found in the Farrel Quartzite, Pilbara Craton, northwestern Australia Christopher House The microfossils are from 20 to 60 microns in length, about the size of fine sand and within the size range of todays microplankton. They were likely planktonic autotrophs  free floating, tiny ocean organisms that produce energy from their environment, according to the study published in the journal Geology. It is surprising to have large, potentially complex fossils that far back, said study lead author Prof Christopher House from Penn State University. The researchers looked at marine sediment rocks from the Farrel Quartzite in Western Australia. Prof Kenichiro Sugitani from Nagoya University, Japan, and a co author discovered these unusually shaped microfossils embedded in really old rock, Prof House said. To determine if these inclusions were actually biological in origin, they looked at 15 different samples of Farrel Quartzite and determined their stable carbon isotope ratios. The percentage of carbon 13 in the microfossils was indicative of material produced by biological processes. They found that the carbon 13 percentage in the background organic matter in the surrounding rock was different from that of the microstructures. When considered along with published morphological and chemical studies, these results indicate that the Farrel Quartzite microstructures are bona fide microfossils, and support the interpretation that the spindles were planktonic. Stable carbon isotope analysis can determine the biological origin of these microfossils because they used carbon dioxide to create energy and incorporated the carbon into themselves. During this process, the organisms selectively incorporate more carbon 12 than carbon 13 from the available carbon, producing a signature of biological origin. The spindles appear to be the same as those found in rocks from the Strelly Pool Formation in Western Australia and the Onverwacht Group in South Africa and Swaziland that are both 3.4 billion years old, said co author Dr Dorothy Oehler from Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Directorate, NASA  Johnson Space Center. The existence of these microfossils in diverse locations as far back as 3.4 billion years ago suggests that the oceans probably had life in them for a very extended period of time. Moreover, this has implications beyond what we have done here, suggesting the evolution of diverse life proceeded quickly.

Archicebus achilles likely weighed about 1 ounce, or 20 30 grams, and was smaller than todays smallest primate, the pygmy mouse lemur Mat Severson  Northern Illinois University The find, described in the journal Nature, is the oldest known fossil primate skeleton. This is the oldest primate skeleton of this quality and completeness ever discovered and one of the most primitive primate fossils ever documented. The origin of primates sets the first milestone for all primate lineages, including that of humanity, explained co author Dr Dan Gebo, an anthropologist with the Northern Illinois University. Although scientists have found primate teeth, jaws, occasionally skulls or a few limb bones from this time period, none of this evidence is as complete as this new skeleton from China. With completeness comes more information and better evidence for the adaptive and evolutionary themes concerning primate evolution. It takes guessing out of the game. Archicebus achilles was recovered from sedimentary rock strata that were deposited in an ancient lake roughly 55 million years ago, a time of global greenhouse conditions, when much of the world was shrouded in tropical rainforests and palm trees grew as far north as Alaska. Like most other fossils recovered from ancient lake strata, the skeleton of Archicebus was found by splitting apart the thin layers of rock containing the fossil. As a result, the skeleton is now preserved in two complementary pieces, each of which contains elements of the actual skeleton as well as impressions of bones from the other side. The skeleton of Archicebus is about 7 million years older than the oldest fossil primate skeletons known previously. It belongs to an entirely separate branch of the primate evolutionary tree from those specimens, lying much closer to the lineage leading to modern monkeys, apes, and humans. Archicebus achilles fossil Xijun Ni  Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing Archicebus marks the first time that we have a reasonably complete picture of a primate close to the divergence between tarsiers and anthropoids, explained study lead author Dr Xijun Ni from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing and the American Museum of Natural History. Senior author Dr Christopher Beard of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh added Archicebus differs radically from any other primate, living or fossil, known to science. It looks like an odd hybrid with the feet of a small monkey, the arms, legs and teeth of a very primitive primate, and a primitive skull bearing surprisingly small eyes. It will force us to rewrite how the anthropoid lineage evolved. The most unusual aspect of Archicebus is its foot anatomy. Theres an odd combination of foot features. We see typical robust grasping big toes, long toes and nailed digits of primitive arboreal primates, but we also have rather monkey looking heel bones and monkey like long metatarsals, often viewed as advanced features that you would not normally find in a primitive early Eocene fossil primate, Dr Gebo said. Restoration of Archicebus achilles Xijun Ni  Chinese Academy of Sciences We have interpreted this new combination of features as evidence that this fossil is quite primitive and its unique anatomical combination is a link between the tarsier and monkey ape branches of dry nosed primates. This new view suggests that the advanced foot features of anthropoids monkeys and apes are in fact primitive for the entire lineage of dry nosed primates, Dr Gebo concluded.

Reconstruction of Barbaturex morrisoni Angie Fox  Nebraska State Museum of Natural History, University of Nebraska Lincoln The lizard, named Barbaturex morrisoni, was a plant eater, like present day iguanas. In todays world, plant eating lizards like iguanas and agamids are much smaller than large mammal herbivores. The largest lizards, like the giant, carnivorous Komodo dragon, are limited to islands that are light on mammal predators. It is not known, however, if lizards are limited in size by competition with mammals, or by temperatures of modern climates, said Dr Jason Head of the University of Nebraska Lincoln, first author of a paper reporting the discovery in journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. At some 60 pounds and six feet in length, Barbaturex morrisoni was one of the largest of its kind  making it a veritable king of land dwelling lizards. Barbatus is from the Latin, which means bearded, and rex, means king  so the name refers to the presence of ventral ridges along the underside of the mandible, as well as the giant size of the lizard, explained senior author Dr Russell Ciochon, a paleoanthropologist with the University of Iowa. The species name honors vocalist Jim Morrison. We did take some liberty in naming the new species after rock legend Jim Morrison, who is known as the Lizard King. Barbaturex morrisoni lived in an ecosystem with a diversity of both herbivorous and carnivorous mammals during a warm age in Earths history when there was no ice at the poles and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were very high. The creature was larger than most of the mammals with which it lived, suggesting that competition or predation by mammals did not restrict its evolution into a giant. We think the warm climate during that period of time allowed the evolution of a large body size and the ability of plant eating lizards to successfully compete in mammal faunas, Dr Head said. You cant fully understand the evolution of ecosystems in the modern world without looking at the ones that preceded them. We wouldve never known this by looking at lizards today. By going back in time using the fossil record, we can find unique information on the origin of modern ecosystems.

Life restoration of Eunotosaurus africanus Smokeybjb  CC BY SA 3.0 Unique among Earths creatures, turtles are the only animals to form a shell on the outside of their bodies through a fusion of modified ribs, vertebrae and shoulder girdle bones. The turtle shell is a unique modification, and how and when it originated has fascinated and confounded biologists for more than two centuries. The oldest known fossil turtle dated back about 210 million years, but it had an already fully formed shell, giving no clues to early shell evolution. Then a clue came in 2008 when the 220 million year old fossil remains of an early turtle species, Odontochelys semitestacea, were discovered in China. It had a fully developed plastron  the belly portion of a turtles shell, but only a partial carapace made up of distinctively broadened ribs and vertebrae on its back. With this knowledge the scientists turned to newly discovered specimens of Eunotosaurus africanus, a South African species 40 million years older than Odontochelys semitestacea that also had distinctively broadened ribs. The skeleton of Eunotosaurus africanus Tyler Lyson et al The detailed study of Eunotosaurus indicated it uniquely shared many features only found in turtles, such as no intercostal muscles that run in between the ribs, paired belly ribs and a specialized mode of rib development, which indicates that Eunotosaurus represents one of the first species to form the evolutionary branch of turtles. Eunotosaurus neatly fills an approximately 3055 million year gap in the turtle fossil record, said lead author Dr Tyler Lyson from the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History, Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History and Yale University. There are several anatomical and developmental features that indicate Eunotosaurus is an early representative of the turtle lineage however, its morphology is intermediate between the specialized shell found in modern turtles and primitive features found in other vertebrates. As such, Eunotosaurus helps bridge the morphological gap between turtles and other reptiles.

Black et al The discovery, reported in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, brings the number of known prehistoric species of koala to eighteen. Today, only one species of koala Phascolarctos cinereus is alive. The new koala species was named Litokoala dicksmithi in honor of the Australian political activist, aviator, entrepreneur and philanthropist Dick Smith. We chose the name to thank Mr Smith for his long term financial support of Australian science, in particular, of fossil research at the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in north western Queensland, explained lead author Dr Karen Black from the University of New South Wales. Litokoala dicksmithi was only about a third of the size of modern koalas, weighing in at about 3 to 4 kg. The discovery of Litokoala dicksmithi is particularly significant because it is one of only two fossil koala species that are known from material preserving the facial region including the snout. The other species, called Nimiokoala greystanesi, which was also discovered at Riversleigh, had a skull that was very possum like in appearance. Litokoala dicksmithi, however, appears to have been much more closely related to the modern koala with numerous similarities in the skull suggesting a more koala like, rather than possum like, face. An interesting feature of the Litokoala skull is the extremely large eye sockets which suggest the intriguing possibility that these koalas were nocturnal with greater visual acuity than the living koala, Dr Black said. Combined with its small body size, this suggests that Litokoala dicksmithi was a more active, agile tree climber than its sleepy, relatively sedentary, cousin that we know. Unlike todays eucalypt munching koala species, Litokoala dicksmithi fed on the rainforest plants that covered much of northern Australia 20 million years ago and may also have eaten some fruit. The onset of dryer conditions in Australia about 15 million years ago led to the contraction of rainforest habitats and the apparent extinction of many koala species including Litokoala dicksmithi.

Life reconstruction of Albertadromeus syntarsus Julius T. Csotonyi Albertadromeus syntarsus lived in what is now southern Alberta in the Late Cretaceous about 77 million years ago. It was identified from a partial hind leg, and other skeletal elements, that indicate it was a speedy runner. The creature was about 5 feet 1.6 m long and weighed 30 lbs 16 kg, comparable to a large turkey. Albertadromeus syntarsus means Alberta runner with fused foot bones. Unlike its much larger ornithopod cousins, the duckbilled dinosaurs, its two fused lower leg bones would have made it a fast, agile two legged runner. This species is the smallest known plant eating dinosaur in its ecosystem, and the team hypothesizes that it used its speed to avoid predation by the many species of meat eating dinosaurs that lived at the same time. The known dinosaur diversity of the Late Cretaceous of North America is dominated by large bodied plant eating dinosaurs. Why are so few small bodied dinosaurs known from the region some 77 million years ago? Smaller animals are less likely to be preserved than larger ones, because their bones are more delicate and are often destroyed before being fossilized. We know from our previous research that there are preservational biases against the bones of these small dinosaurs, explained Dr Caleb Brown of the University of Toronto, lead author of a paper published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. We are now starting to uncover this hidden diversity, and although skeletons of these small ornithopods are both rare and fragmentary, our study shows that these dinosaurs were more abundant in their ecosystems than previously thought.

Venezuelas fossils include all the families of crocodile species that still exist all over the world today the so called true crocodiles Crocodylidae the Alligatoridae, which, besides the true alligators, also include caimans and the gharials Gavialidae, which are characterized by their extremely long, thin snouts and are only found in Southeast Asia nowadays.

With its spherical teeth Globidentosuchus brachyrostris most likely specialized in shellfish, snails or crabs. Giant crocodiles, which grew up to 39 feet 12 m long, fed on turtles, giant rodents and smaller crocodiles.

The reason behind their extinction, however, was not temperature or climate changes  temperatures in the Caribbean remained stable around the Miocene Pliocene boundary. Instead, it was caused by a tectonic event. The Andean uplift changed the courses of rivers.

Reconstruction of the brain in the young and fully grown Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki Stephan Lautenschlager  University of Bristol The paleontologists studied different fossils of the Jurassic dinosaur Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki a very young juvenile individual of 3 years and a fully grown specimen of more than 12 years of age. The two different growth stages of Dysalotosaurus provided a unique opportunity to study their brain, and how it developed during the growth of the animal, Dr Lautenschlager explained. Well preserved fossil material, which can be used to reconstruct the brain anatomy is usually rare. Thus, we were fortunate to have different growth stages available for our study, Dr H\u00fcbner added. By looking at the brain and inner ear anatomy, they found that the brain of Dysalotosaurus underwent considerable changes during growth, most likely as a response to environmental and metabolic requirements. However, important parts responsible for the sense of hearing and cognitive processes were already well developed in the young individual. Fossil skull of the juvenile specimen of Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki Tom H\u00fcbner  Nieders\u00e4chsisches Landesmuseum Hannover Our study shows that the brain was already well developed in the young dinosaurs and adapted perfectly to interact with their environment and other individuals, Dr Lautenschlager concluded. The findings, published online in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology, have important ramifications for the understanding of how parts of the brain developed in dinosaurs. However, further research is necessary to investigate if the pattern of brain development in individual dinosaurs is also reflected in a large scale trend during the more than 150 million years of dinosaur evolution.

Reconstruction of Kootenichela deppi Adapted from David Legg, 2013 The 505 million year old fossil, named Kootenichela deppi, is a distant ancestor of lobsters and scorpions. When I first saw the pair of isolated claws in the fossil records of this species I could not help but think of Edward Scissorhands. Even the genus name, Kootenichela, includes the reference to this film as chela is Latin for claws or scissors. In truth, I am also a bit of a Depp fan and so what better way to honour the man than to immortalize him as an ancient creature that once roamed the sea? explained Dr Legg, who has described Kootenichela deppi in a paper published in the Journal of Paleontology. Kootenichela deppi belongs to a group known as the great appendage arthropods, or megacheirans, which refers to the enlarged pincer like frontal claws that they share. The great appendage arthropods are an early relation of arthropods, which includes spiders, scorpions, centipedes, millipedes, insects and crabs. Just imagine it the prawns covered in mayonnaise in your sandwich, the spider climbing up your wall and even the fly that has been banging into your window and annoyingly flying into your face are all descendants of Kootenichela deppi. Current estimates indicate that there are more than one million known insects and potentially 10 million more yet to be categorized, which potentially means that Kootenichela deppi has a huge family tree, Dr Legg said. Specimens of Kootenichela deppi David Legg, 2013 Kootenichela deppi lived in very shallow seas, similar to modern coastal environments, off the cost of British Columbia in Canada, which was situated much closer to the equator 500 million years ago. The sea temperature would have been much hotter than it is today and although coral reefs had not yet been established, the creature would have lived in a similar environment consisting of sponges. Kootenichela deppi was about 1.5 inches 4 cm long with an elongated trunk for a body and millipede like legs, which it used to scuttle along the sea floor with the occasional short swim. It also had large eyes composed of many lenses like the compound eyes of a fly. They were positioned on top of movable stalks called peduncles to help it more easily search for food and look out for predators. Dr Legg believes that Kootenichela deppi would have been a hunter or scavenger. Its large Edward Scissorhands like claws with their elongated spines may have been used to capture prey, or they could have helped it to probe the sea floor looking for sea creatures hiding in sediment.

Artists impression of the newly discovered Rukwapithecus, front, and Nsungwepithecus, right Mauricio Anton Both species are new to science, and were collected from a single site in the Rukwa Rift Basin of Tanzania. Geological analyses of the site indicate that the finds are 25 million years old, significantly older than fossils previously documented for either of two major groups of primates the group that today includes apes and humans hominoids, and the group that includes Old World monkeys such as baboons and macaques cercopithecoids. Rukwapithecus fleaglei, an early hominoid represented by a mandible preserving several teeth, and Nsungwepithecus gunnelli, an early cercopithecoid represented by a tooth and jaw fragment, lived 34 to 23 million years ago during the Oligocene epoch. The late Oligocene is among the least sampled intervals in primate evolutionary history, and the Rukwa field area provides a first glimpse of the animals that were alive at that time from Africa south of the equator, said Prof Nancy Stevens, lead author of a paper reporting the discovery in the journal Nature. The study documents for the first time that the two lineages were already evolving separately during this geological period. Prior to these finds, the oldest fossil representatives of the hominoid and cercopithecoid lineages were recorded from the early Miocene, at sites dating millions of years younger.

Studies of clock like mutations in primate DNA have indicated that the split between apes and Old World monkeys occurred between 30 million and 25 million years ago. Fossils from the Rukwa Rift Basin in southwestern Tanzania provide the first real test of the hypothesis that these groups diverged so early, by revealing a novel glimpse into this late Oligocene terrestrial ecosystem.

Malawania anachronus, the Jurassic style Cretaceous ichthyosaur from Iraq Robert Nicholls, www.paleocreations.com  C. M. Kosemen, www.cmkosemen.com Ichthyosaurs are dolphin like marine reptiles known from hundreds of fossils from the time of the dinosaurs. They ranged in size from less than one to over 20 m 65 feet in length. All gave birth to live young at sea, and some were fast swimming, deep diving animals with enormous eyeballs and a so called warm blooded physiology, explained Dr Valentin Fischer of the University of Liege in Belgium, first author of a paper published in the journal Biology Letters. Until recently, it was thought that ichthyosaurs declined gradually in diversity through multiple extinction events during the Jurassic period. These successive events were thought to have killed off all ichthyosaurs except those strongly adapted for fast swimming life in the open ocean. Due to this pattern, it has been assumed that ichthyosaurs were constantly and rapidly evolving to be ever faster open water swimmers seemingly, there was no stasis in their long evolutionary history. However, an entirely new ichthyosaur species from Iraq substantially alters this view of the group. The specimen concerned was found during the 1950s by British petroleum geologists. The fossil  a well preserved partial skeleton that consists of much of the front half of the animal  wasnt exactly being treated with the respect it deserves. Preserved within a large, flat slab of rock, it was being used as a stepping stone on a mule track. Luckily, the geologists realized its potential importance and took it back to the UK, where it remains today, said co author Dr Darren Naish from the University of Southampton. Study of the specimen began during the 1970s with ichthyosaur expert Robert Appleby, then of University College, Cardiff. Robert Appleby recognized that the specimen was significant, but unfortunately died before resolving the precise age of the fossil, which he realized was critical, said Dr Jeff Liston of National Museums Scotland. So continuation of the study fell to a new generation of researchers. In the new study, researchers name it Malawania anachronus, which means out of time swimmer. Despite being Cretaceous in age, Malawania represents the last known member of a kind of ichthyosaur long believed to have gone extinct during the Early Jurassic, more than 66 million years earlier. Specimen of Malawania anachronus Valentin Fischer et al Remarkably, this kind of archaic ichthyosaur appears characterized by an evolutionary stasis they seem not to have changed much between the Early Jurassic and the Cretaceous, a very rare feat in the evolution of marine reptiles. Malawanias discovery is similar to that of the coelacanth in the 1930s it represents an animal that seems out of time for its age. This living fossil of its time demonstrates the existence of a lineage that we had never even imagined. Maybe the existence of such Jurassic style ichthyosaurs in the Cretaceous has been missed because they always lived in the Middle East, a region that has previously yielded only a single, very fragmentary ichthyosaur fossil, Dr Fischer concluded.

Skull of Aorun zhaoi James Clark  George Washington University The skull, mandible and partial skeleton of the new dinosaur, named Aorun zhaoi, were unearthed in a remote region of Xinjiang in 2006. According to a paper published in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, Aorun zhaoi was about 3 feet 1 m long and weighed 3 pounds. All that was exposed on the surface was a bit of the leg. We were pleasantly surprised to find a skull buried in the rock too, explained co author Prof James Clark of the George Washington University. Aorun zhaoi lived more than 161 million years ago, in the earliest part of the Late Jurassic Period. Its small, numerous teeth suggest that it would have eaten prey like lizards and small relatives of todays mammals and crocodilians. The dinosaur is named after the Dragon King in the Chinese epic tale Journey to the West. It wasnt necessarily a small dinosaur species, though, because Aorun was still a youngster when it became a fossil. We were able to look at microscopic details of Aoruns bones and they showed that the animal was less than a year old when it died on the banks of a stream, said lead author Jonah Choiniere of the University of the Witwatersrand, the George Washington University and the American Museum of Natural History.

Artists conception of Microraptor, a small flying dinosaur, eating a fish it has caught Emily Willoughby New evidence of Microraptors hunting ability came from fossilized remains in China, explained Scott Persons, a paleontology graduate student at the University of Alberta. We were very fortunate that this Microraptor was found in volcanic ash and its stomach content of fish was easily identified. Before the discovery, paleontologists believed microraptors, which were about the size of a modern day hawk, lived in trees where they preyed exclusively on small birds and mammals about the size of squirrels. Now we know that Microraptor operated in varied terrain and had a varied diet. It took advantage of a variety of prey in the wet, forested environment that was China during the early Cretaceous period, 120 million years ago, Persons said. Further analysis of the Microraptor fossil revealed that its teeth were adapted to catching slippery, wiggling prey like fish. Dinosaur researchers have established that most meat eaters had teeth with serrations on both sides, which helped the predator saw through meat like a steak knife. But the Microraptors teeth were serrated on just one side, and were angled forward. Microraptor seems adapted to impale fish on its teeth. With reduced serrations, the prey wouldnt tear itself apart while it struggled. Microraptor could simply raise its head back the fish would slip off the teeth and be swallowed whole, no fuss, no muss. Persons said Microraptor had long feathers on its forearms, hind legs and tail. It was capable of short, controlled flights.

Reconstruction of Acrotholus audeti Julius Csotonyi The newly discovered dinosaur, named Acrotholus audeti, was 6 feet long and weighed about 40 kg. Acrotholus means high dome, referring to its dome shaped skull, which is composed of solid bone over 2 inches 10 cm thick. The species name audeti honors Alberta rancher Roy Audet, on whose land the best specimen was discovered in 2008. According to the scientists, Acrotholus represents the oldest bone headed dinosaur in North America, and possibly the world. The dinosaur walked on two legs and had a greatly thickened, domed skull above its eyes, which was used for display to other members of its species, and may have also been used in head butting contests. Acrotholus provides a wealth of new information on the evolution of bone headed dinosaurs. Although it is one of the earliest known members this group, its thickened skull dome is surprisingly well developed for its geological age. More importantly, the unique fossil record of these animals suggests that we are only beginning to understand the diversity of small bodied plant eating dinosaurs, explained lead author Dr David Evans of the Royal Ontario Museum and University of Toronto. Small mammals and reptiles can be very diverse and abundant in modern ecosystems, but small dinosaurs less than 100 kg are considerably less common than large ones in the fossil record. Whether this pattern is a true reflection of dinosaur communities, or is related to the greater potential for small bones to be destroyed by carnivores and natural decay, has been debated. The massively constructed skull domes of bone headed dinosaurs pachycephalosaurs are resistant to destruction, and are much more common than their relatively delicate skeletons  which resemble those of other small plant eating dinosaurs. Therefore, the researchers suggest that the pachycephalosaur fossil record can provide valuable insights into the diversity of small, plant eating dinosaurs as a whole. We can predict that many new small dinosaur species like Acrotholus are waiting to be discovered by researchers willing to sort through the many small bones that they pick up in the field. This fully domed and mature individual suggests that there is an undiscovered, hidden diversity of small bodied dinosaurs. So when we look back, we need to reimagine the paleoenvironment. There is an evolutionary history that we just dont know because the fossil record is incomplete. This discovery also highlights the importance of landowners, like Roy Audet, who grant access to their land and allow scientifically important finds to be made, said co author Dr Michael Ryan of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.

Reconstruction of Pierolapithecus catalaunicus Institut Catal\u00e0 de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont Dr Moya Sola with colleagues discovered the fossil specimen of Pierolapithecus in Spain in 2002. They estimated that the hominid lived about 11.9 million years ago, arguing that it could be the last common ancestor of modern great apes chimpanzees, orangutans, bonobos, gorillas and humans. According to the new analysis published in the Journal of Human Evolution, the shape of the specimens pelvis indicates that Pierolapithecus lived near the beginning of the great ape evolution, after the lesser apes had started to develop separately but before the great ape species began to diversify. The team members used a tabletop laser scanner attached to a turntable to capture detailed surface images of the fossil, which provided them with a 3 D model to compare the Pierolapithecus pelvis anatomy to living species. The ilium  the largest bone in the pelvis  of the Pierolapithecus is wider than that of Proconsul nyanzae, a more primitive ape that lived approximately 18 million years ago. The wider pelvis may be related to the apes greater lateral balance and stability while moving using its forelimbs. However, the fingers of the Pierolapithecus catalaunicus are unlike those of modern great apes, indicating that great apes may have evolved differently than scientists originally hypothesized, said study first author Dr Ashley Hammond from the University of Missouri School of Medicine. Following an in depth examination of Pierolapithecus, experts say the shape of the specimens pelvis indicates that it lived near the beginning of the great ape evolution, after the lesser apes had started to develop separately but before the great ape species began to diversify University of Missouri School of Medicine Pierolapithecus catalaunicus seemed to use a lot of upright behaviors such as vertical climbing, but not the fully suspensory behaviors we see in great apes alive today. Today, chimpanzees, orangutans, bonobos and gorillas use forelimb dominated behaviors to swing below branches, but Pierolapithecus catalaunicus didnt have the long, curved finger bones needed for suspension, so those behaviors evolved more recently. The researchers continue searching for fossils to further explain the evolution of the great apes in Africa. Contrary to popular belief, were not looking for a missing link, Dr Hammond said. We have different pieces of the evolutionary puzzle and big gaps between points in time and fossil species. We need to continue fieldwork to identify more fossils and determine how the species are related and how they lived. Ultimately, everything is connected.

Specimen of Eocypselus rowei Daniel T. Ksepka et al First collected in southwestern Wyoming in a fossil site known as the Green River Formation, Eocypselus rowei lived about 50 million years ago. It was a small creature about 12 cm long from head to tail, and weighed less than an ounce. Paleontologists led by Dr Daniel Ksepka of the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in Durham, North Carolina, spotted the fossil while working at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The bird was named in honor of John W. Rowe, Chairman of the Field Museums Board of Trustees. The fossil is unusual in having exceptionally well preserved feathers, which allowed the researchers to reconstruct the size and shape of the birds wings in ways not possible with bones alone. Feathers account for more than half of the birds total wing length. To find out where the fossil fit in the bird family tree, the paleontologists compared Eocypselus rowei to extinct and modern day species. The analysis suggests that the bird was an evolutionary precursor to the group that includes todays swifts and hummingbirds. Given the differences in wing shape between these two closely related groups of birds, the researchers have puzzled over how swift and hummingbird flight came to be. Finding fossil relatives like this specimen is the key to figuring that out. This fossil bird represents the closest weve gotten to the point where swifts and hummingbirds went their separate ways, said Dr Ksepka, who with co authors report the results in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Hummingbirds have short wings relative to their bodies, which makes them good at hovering in mid air. Swifts have super long wings for gliding and high speed flight. But the wings of Eocypselus rowei were somewhere in between. Based on its wing shape, it probably wasnt a hoverer, like a hummingbird, and it probably wasnt as efficient at fast flight as a swift, Dr Ksepka explained. The shape of the birds wings, coupled with its tiny size, suggest that the ancestors of todays swifts and hummingbirds got small before each groups unique flight behavior came to be. Hummingbirds came from small bodied ancestors, but the ability to hover didnt come to be until later, the scientist said. Closer study of the feathers under a scanning electron microscope revealed that carbon residues in the fossils  once thought to be traces of bacteria that fed on feathers  are fossilized melanosomes, tiny cell structures containing melanin pigments that give birds and other animals their color. The findings suggest that the ancient bird was probably black and may have had a glossy or iridescent sheen, like swifts living today. Based on its beak shape it probably ate insects.

Prof Christian Sidor from the University of Washington, who is first author of a paper reporting the results online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, explained the fossil record from the Karoo of South Africa remains a good representation of four legged land animals across southern Pangea before the extinction event. But after the event animals werent as uniformly and widely distributed as before. We had to go looking in some fairly unorthodox places. Prof Christian Sidor and his colleagues headed by Dr Linda Tsuji, also from the University of Washington, created two snapshots of four legged animals about 5 million years before and again about 10 million years after the Earths largest mass extinction about 252 million years ago. Prior to the extinction event, for example, the pig sized Dicynodon was a dominant plant eating species across southern Pangea. Pangea is the name given to the landmass when all the worlds continents were joined together. Southern Pangea was made up of what is today Africa, South America, Antarctica, Australia and India. After the mass extinction at the end of the Permian, Dicynodon disappeared and other related species were so greatly decreased that newly emerging herbivores could suddenly compete with them. Groups that did well before the extinction didnt necessarily do well afterward. What we call evolutionary incumbency was fundamentally reset, Prof Sidor said. The pig size Dicynodon was part of a large, dominant group of plant eaters found across the southern hemisphere until the mass extinction event weakened their numbers so that newly emerging herbivores could compete Marlene Donnelly  Field Museum of Natural History The snapshot 10 million years after the extinction event reveals that archosaurs were in Tanzanian and Zambian basins, but not distributed across all of southern Pangea as had been the pattern for four legged animals prior to the extinction. Archosaurs are the group of reptiles that includes crocodiles, dinosaurs, birds and a variety of extinct forms. They are of interest because it is thought they led to animals like Asilisaurus, a dinosaur like animal, and Nyasasaurus parringtoni, a dog sized creature with a five foot tail that scientists in December 2012 announced could be the earliest dinosaur, or else the closest relative found so far. Early archosaurs being found mainly in Tanzania is an example of how fragmented communities became after the extinction event, Prof Sidor said. A new framework for analyzing biogeographic patterns from species distributions, developed by co author Daril Vilhena, provided a way to discern the complex recovery. It revealed that before the extinction event 35 percent of four legged species were found in two or more of the five areas studied, with some species having ranges that stretched 1,600 miles 2,600 kilometers, encompassing the Tanzanian and South African basins. Ten million years after the extinction event, there was clear geographic clustering and just 7 percent of species were found in two or more regions.

Troodon formosus Using egg clutches found in Alberta and Montana, the researchers closely examined the shells of fossil Troodon eggs. In a paper published in the journal Paleobiology, they concluded that Troodon, which was known to lay its eggs almost vertically, would have only buried the egg bottoms in mud. Based on our calculations, the eggshells of Troodon were very similar to those of brooding birds, which tells us that this dinosaur did not completely bury its eggs in nesting materials like crocodiles do, said study co author Dr Darla Zelenitsky of the University of Calgary. Both the eggs and the surrounding sediments indicate only partial burial thus an adult would have directly contacted the exposed parts of the eggs during incubation, said lead author Prof David Varricchio from Montana State University. While the nesting style for Troodon is unusual, there are similarities with a peculiar nester among birds called the Egyptian Plover that broods its eggs while theyre partially buried in sandy substrate of the nest. Researchers have always struggled to answer the question of how dinosaurs incubated their eggs, because of the scarcity of evidence for incubation behaviors. As dinosaurs closest living relatives, crocodiles and birds offer some insights. Paleontologists know that crocodiles and birds that completely bury their eggs for hatching have eggs with many pores or holes in the eggshell, to allow for respiration. This is unlike brooding birds which dont bury their eggs consequently, their eggs have far fewer pores. The team counted and measured the pores in the shells of Troodon eggs to assess how water vapor would have been conducted through the shell compared with eggs from contemporary crocodiles, mound nesting birds and brooding birds. They are optimistic their methods can be applied to other dinosaur species fossil eggs to show how they may have been incubated. For now, this particular study helps substantiate that some bird like nesting behaviors evolved in meat eating dinosaurs prior to the origin of birds. It also adds to the growing body of evidence that shows a close evolutionary relationship between birds and dinosaurs, Dr Zelenitsky said. Bibliographic information David J. Varricchio et al.

Outline of Dahalokely tokana with a human for scale, showing known bones in white and missing areas patterned after related animals Andrew Farke  Joseph Sertich The dinosaur, named Dahalokely tokana, lived about 90 million years ago. The species name is from the Malagasy language, meaning lonely small bandit. It is estimated to have been 9  14 feet long. Dahalokely belongs to a group called abelisauroids, carnivorous dinosaurs common to the southern continents. Up to this point, no dinosaur remains from between 165 and 70 million years ago could be identified to the species level in Madagascar  a 95 million year gap in the fossil record. Dahalokely shortens this gap by 20 million years. When Dahalokely was alive, Madagascar was connected to India, and the two landmasses were isolated in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Geological evidence indicates that India and Madagascar separated around 88 million years ago, just after Dahalokely lived. Thus, Dahalokely potentially could have been ancestral to animals that lived later in both Madagascar and India. We had always suspected that abelisauroids were in Madagascar 90 million years ago, because they were also found in younger rocks on the island. Dahalokely nicely confirms this hypothesis, said Dr Andrew Farke from the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology, lead author of a paper describing the new species in the journal PLoS ONE. But, the fossils of Dahalokely are tantalizingly incomplete  there is so much more we want to know. Was Dahalokely closely related to later abelisauroids on Madagascar, or did it die out without descendents? Dr Farke said. This dinosaur was closely related to other famous dinosaurs from the southern continents, like the horned Carnotaurus from Argentina and Majungasaurus, also from Madagascar, said second author Dr Joe Sertich of the Denver Museum of Nature  Science.

Euphanerops, a fossil jawless fish that lived some 370 million years ago Robert S. Sansom et al  Biology Letters The find makes the fish one of the first vertebrate to develop paired appendages such as fins, legs or arms. However, their positioning is incredibly unusual. Euphanerops is unique because its anal fin is paired meaning there is one fin on each side of the fish, explained Dr Robert Sansom of the University of Leicesters Department of Geology, lead author of a study published in the journal Biology Letters. Up until now anal fins have only been seen on jawed fish where they are unpaired and this is true of both extinct and modern fish. The age of Euphanerops is important as it dates from the time of a deep evolutionary split between jawed and jawless fish, the two main divisions of vertebrates alive today. As such, it represents an important stage in the evolution of paired appendages. Its not clear why the fins are positioned so far back on the fish, or what advantage they might have provided. However, they do show that our early vertebrate ancestors tried out lots of different body plans before settling on two arms and two legs. If they hadnt then our bodies would have looked very different Dr Sansom came across the paired fins as part of a study of Euphanerops fossils in Quebec, Canada. 3D surface scans of fossils and comparison of specimens preserved in different conditions revealed that there were two fan shaped fins, a left and a right. The unusual paired anal fin of Euphanerops lends support to the idea that there was some degree of developmental and evolutionary experimentation in some fish. After the Devonian period and the extinction of a lot of species, the jawed vertebrate body exhibits fewer deviations from the formula of paired pectoral, paired pelvic, unpaired dorsal and unpaired anal appendages. The discovery of new anatomical conditions will hopefully shed more light on the timing and sequence of the events underlying the origin and diversification of vertebrate appendages, Dr Sansom concluded.

An adult Lufengosaurus was approximately 27 feet 8 m long. The disarticulated bones probably came from several nests containing dinosaurs at various embryonic stages, giving Dr Reiszs team the rare opportunity to study ongoing growth patterns. Dinosaur embryos are more commonly found in single nests or partial nests, which offer only a snapshot of one developmental stage. To investigate the dinosaurs development, the team concentrated on the largest embryonic bone, the femur. This bone showed a consistently rapid growth rate, doubling in length from 12 to 24 mm as the dinosaurs grew inside their eggs. This very fast growth may indicate that sauropodomorphs like Lufengosaurus had a short incubation period. The paleontologists found that the femurs were being reshaped even as they were in the egg. Examination of the bones anatomy and internal structure showed that as they contracted and pulled on the hard bone tissue, the dinosaurs muscles played an active role in changing the shape of the developing femur. This suggests that dinosaurs, like modern birds, moved around inside their eggs, Dr Reisz explained. It represents the first evidence of such movement in a dinosaur. Scientists discovered organic material inside the embryonic bones from Lufeng, China Robert R. Reisz et al The team also discovered organic material inside the embryonic bones. Using precisely targeted infrared spectroscopy, they conducted chemical analyses of the dinosaur bone and found evidence of what they believe is collagen fibers. Collagen is a protein characteristically found in bone. The bones of ancient animals are transformed to rock during the fossilization process, Dr Reisz said. To find remnants of proteins in the embryos is really remarkable, particularly since these specimens are over 100 million years older than other fossils containing similar organic material. A find such as the Lufeng bonebed is extraordinarily rare in the fossil record, and is valuable for both its great age and the opportunity it offers to study dinosaur embryology. It greatly enhances our knowledge of how these remarkable animals from the beginning of the Age of Dinosaurs grew.

Dinosaurs ruled for Earth for 160 million years, said study co author Scott Persons, a paleontologist with the University of Alberta. From dinosaurs weve learned about color vision in some of todays animals, and the ancient animals are linked to the evolution of other life we take for granted, like birds and flowering plants. The research has produced some of the strongest evidence ever found that dinosaurs could paddle long distances. Persons and his colleagues arrived at that conclusion after examining unusual claw marks on fossilized rocks found in China. They determined that a series of claw marks found in now well known dinosaur tracks were left by the tips of a two legged dinosaurs feet. The dinosaurs claw marks show it was swimming along in this river and just its tiptoes were touching bottom, Persons said. The claw marks cover a distance of 50 feet 15 m, which the researchers believe is evidence of a dinosaurs ability to swim with coordinated leg movements.

The study reveals that living species of tadpole shrimp are much younger than the fossils they so much resemble, calling into question the term living fossil. European Tadpole Shrimp, Triops cancriformis Africa Gomez  CC BY 3.0 Charles Darwin introduced the term living fossil when talking about the platypus and lungfish, groups that appear to have diversified little and appear not to have changed over millions of years. For him living fossils were odd remnants of formerly more diverse groups, and suggestive of a connection between different extant groups. Ever since, the term has been widely used to describe organisms such as the coelacanth, the horseshoe crab and the ginkgo tree. The term has been controversial, as it appears to suggest that evolution has stopped altogether for these organisms, and some scientists have argued that it should be abandoned. Tadpole shrimps are a small group of ancient crustaceans that are often called living fossils, because the living species look virtually identical to fossils older than the dinosaurs. Analyzing DNA sequences of all known tadpole shrimps, and using fossils from related crustacean groups, researchers led by Dr Africa G\u00f3mez from the University of Hull showed that tadpole shrimps have in fact undergone several periods of radiation and extinction. Different species of tadpole shrimp often look very similar, and so it is only with the advent of DNA sequencing that scientists have realized that they are a surprisingly diverse group. The teams results uncovered a total of 38 species, many of them still undescribed. This abundance of cryptic species makes it very difficult for fossils to be assigned to any particular species as they all look remarkably similar. For example, 250 million year old fossils have been assigned to the living European species Triops cancriformis whereas the teams results indicate that the living T. cancriformis evolved less than 25 million years ago. In groups like tadpole shrimps where cryptic speciation is common, the fossil record says very little about patterns of evolution and diversification and so the term living fossil can be quite misleading. For this reason, we used fossils from related groups to gain an understanding about the evolution of tadpole shrimps, explained co author Dr Tom Mathers, also from the University of Hull. Living fossils evolve like any other organism, they just happen to have a good body plan that has survived the test of time. A good analogy could be made with cars, Dr G\u00f3mez added. For example the Mini has an old design that is still selling, but newly made Minis have electronic windows, GPS and airbags in that sense, they are still evolving, they are not unchanged but most of the change has been under the hood rather than external, she said. By comparison, organisms labeled as living fossils such as tadpole shrimps, are constantly fine tuning their adaptation to their environment. Although outwardly they look very similar to tadpole shrimp fossils from the age of the dinosaurs, their DNA and reproductive strategies are relatively hidden features that are constantly evolving. The flexibility of their reproductive strategies, which our research has revealed, could be the evolutionary trick that has allowed them to persist as a morphologically conservative group for so long.

They resembled large, up to 13 feet 4 m in length, aquatic lizards, with long, flexible bodies and short limbs. Dr Hes team has described a new species of thalattosaur, named Concavispina biseridens, in the latest issue of the Journal of Paleontology. C. biseridens is a nearly complete skeleton with the tip of the rostrum missing, and it is the largest known thalattosaur in terms of absolute skull length. The skull is 50 cm long and the distance from the broken tip of rostrum to the anterior margin of the orbit is 252 mm, the team wrote. C. biseridens is characterized by a long skull, measuring approximately half the length of presacral portion of the vertebral column, two rows of blunt teeth on the anterior part of the maxilla, and neural spines that have convex anterior or posterior margins and V shaped notches in their dorsal margins. Concavispina differs from all thalattosaurs except Xinpusaurus in that the anterior end of the maxilla is curved dorsally, less than five cervical vertebrae are present, and the proximal end of the humerus is wider than the distal end. Concavispina biseridens Jun Liu Thalattosaurs have moderate adaptations to marine lifestyles, including long, paddle like tails and slender bodies. C. biseridens has a very short neck as ichthyosaurs, but it has a long tail with a laterally compressed appearance due to the presence of relatively high neural spines and long chevrons. The anterior teeth in Xinpusaurus are pointed and robust, while the posterior teeth are blunt and broad. In Concavispina the premaxillary teeth are pointed and slender, while the maxillary teeth are small, blunt, and anteriorly positioned. Xinpusaurus probably had the power to crush shells, while Concavispina could have eaten softer food such as fish and jellyfish, said study first author Dr Jun Liu from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Reconstruction of the juvenile placodont Palatodonta bleekeri Jaime Chirinos For around 50 million years, placodonts populated the flat coastal regions of the Tethys Ocean, in modern day Europe and China. The most distinctive feature of these creatures was their teeth the upper jaw had two rows of flattened teeth  one on the palate and one on the jawbone, while the lower jaw only had one set of teeth ideal for crushing shellfish and crustaceans. According to a research team led by Dr Torsten Scheyer, a paleontologist at the University of Zurich, the Winterswijk skull is the earliest form of all known placodonts. The juvenile animal lived about 246 million years ago. At around 2 cm in size, the skull is exceptionally well preserved and its characteristics set it apart from previous placodont discoveries. The basal most known placodonts to date have the groups trademark double row of crushing teeth in the upper jaw. The flattened teeth that give these animals their name only appear in more derived placodonts. Unlike all the other placodonts discovered to date, the Winterswijk specimen has conical, pointed teeth instead of flattened or ball shaped crushing ones, which means the pointed teeth on the lower jaw slotted precisely into the gap between the palate and upper jawbone teeth when biting, said Dr Scheyer, who co authored a paper in Nature Communications. The groups trademark double row of teeth in the upper jaw is proof that the new find is actually a placodont. The teeth of Palatodonta bleekeri, the scientific name given to the Winterswijk specimen, were specialized in gripping and piercing soft prey. The newly found skull of a juvenile placodont from Winterswijk, the Netherlands UZH The double row of teeth in the new find combined with its considerable age lead us to conclude that it is a very early placodont, from which the later forms developed, Dr Scheyer said. The formation of crushing teeth and the specialization of a diet of shellfish and crustaceans thus developed later within placodont evolution. The small Palatodonta bleekeri skull sheds new light on the ongoing debate on where the placodonts originated previous finds suggested origins in the shelf sea areas of either present day China or Europe. Due to the considerable age of the find and its basal form, however, the European origin of the placodonts is confirmed. The team is hoping for further exciting finds in Winterswijk to discover more about the evolution of placodonts.

Crow sized Vectidraco daisymorrisae University of Southampton The new flying reptile, named Vectidraco daisymorrisae, dates from the late Cretaceous period, some 115 million years ago. It is currently known only from a well preserved fossil pelvis, just 1.5 inches 40 mm long, but that was enough for the scientists to work out that they were dealing with a new species. The fossil was found in 2008 by Daisy Morris, who was 5 at the time. In recognition of her find and the generous donation of the fossil by the Morris family to the Natural History Museum, the species has been named in her honor. The genus name means dragon from the Isle of Wight. Several features of the fossil allowed the paleontologists to work out that the species most probably belongs to a group of pterodactyloids called the azhdarchoids. Vectidraco grouped close to the tapejarids  a group of relatively small, short snouted azhdarchoids known from Brazil, Spain and China  and was probably tapejarid like in shape and lifestyle. Azhdarchoids are, in my opinion, among the most interesting of pterosaurs. All are from the Cretaceous, all are toothless, and many were especially well adapted for life in terrestrial environments like woodlands, tropical forests and floodplains, said Dr Darren Naish, lead author of the paper describing Vectidraco in the journal PLoS ONE. Bony head crests are a typical feature of the group, as are adaptations in the fore  and hindlimbs for quadrupedal walking. As well as tapejarids, the group includes the somewhat larger thalassodromids, and the sometimes gigantic, long snouted azhdarchids. By comparing Vectidraco to azhdarchoids known from better remains, it probably had a wingspan of about 30 inches 75 cm, and was about 14 inches 35 cm from snout to tail. In other words, it was similar in size to a gull or a large crow. It was probably crested, and with limb proportions that allowed it to be a reasonably good walker and runner on the ground and an expert flier when in cluttered habitats like forests.

Life size model of Edenopteron keithcrooki built by Baz Crook Australian National University The paleontologists were excavating the skeleton of an extinct armored fish from 360 million year old rock near Eden, Australia, when the bones they uncovered suggested there was more in the site than met the eye. As we lifted out the block, we noticed a very large fang, at least 4 cm long, said Dr Gavin Young. Armored fish dont have teeth, so we knew there must be a much larger predator also preserved at the site. We uncovered an almost complete skull and shoulder girdle of an enormous lobe finned fish, with jaws about 48 cm long. The paleontologists used traditional methods of acid etching and casting, but also experimented with the latest surface scanning techniques to reconstruct the bones, and used high resolution CT scanner to investigate the internal structure of the teeth. We compared the shape and structure of the preserved bones with about 100 fossil fish species from elsewhere in the world. It turns out that we have not only a species new to science, but also a new genus of lobe finned fish, which we have named Edenopteron after the town of Eden, Dr Young said. The new species, described in the journal PloS ONE, was named Edenopteron keithcrooki after Prof Keith Crook of the former Australian National Universitys Geology Department. The discovery of this new species has implications for the classification of other Devonian lobe finned fish, Dr Young said. This animal had some unusual features compared to Devonian fish fossils from the Northern Hemisphere, including extra bones in its palate, and strange ornamentation on the scales. When E. keithcrooki was alive, Australia and Antarctica were joined in the great southern supercontinent of Gondwana. Its pretty clear that we had an endemic lobe finned fish group in this part of the world, and that has very interesting consequences for hypotheses of where the first land animals evolved, Dr Young said. The next step for the team is to continue excavating the site to see if the body of Edenopteron might be preserved deeper in the rock. That would be a massive excavation because it would be 2 to 3 m long, but would most definitely be an absolutely spectacular find, Dr Young concluded.

First paleontological survey was conducted by Dr Nikolai Ovodov in 1975, when complete skull and mandibles of a dog like canid were found. The cave is about 90 m long. Fossil bearing sediments in the cave contain remains of permafrost and frozen mummified animal tissues, and numerous bones of mammals and birds. More than 70,000 mammalian bones and bone fragments were found in the cave. Large mammals are represented mainly by foxes, cave hyena Crocuta spelaea, grey wolf Canis lupus, and brown bear Ursus arctos. Scientists believe that the cave was primarily used in antiquity by hyenas as a den the remains of at least 137 individual hyenas were found. Brown bears and wolves also appear to have used the grotto as a den on occasion. Among other animals, the most numerous are ibex, sheep and hares. No artifacts were recovered from this layer but the presence of small charcoal pieces and burnt bones probably testify that ancient people visited the cave occasionally. The new study, published in the open access journal PloS ONE, evaluates the relationship of the 33,000 year old fossil from Siberia to modern dogs and wolves based on DNA sequence. Human domestication of dogs predates the beginning of agriculture about 10,000 years ago, but when modern dogs emerged as a species distinct from wolves is still unclear. Although some previous studies have suggested that this separation of domestic dogs and wolves occurred over 100,000 years ago, the oldest known fossils of modern dogs are only about 36,000 years old. A team of scientists led by Dr Anna Druzhkova from the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Russian Federation, found that the fossil, named the Altai dog, is more closely related to modern dogs and prehistoric canids found on the American continents than it is to wolves. These results suggest a more ancient history of the dog outside the Middle East or East Asia, previously thought to be the centers where dogs originated, the scientists said.

Illustration of the High Arctic camel on Ellesmere Island during the Pliocene warm period, about 3.5 million years ago \u00a9 Julius Csotonyi The discovery, described in the journal Nature Communications, is based on 30 fossil fragments of a leg bone found on Ellesmere Island, and represents the most northerly record for early camels, whose ancestors are known to have originated in North America some 45 million years ago. The fossils are about 3.5 million years old mid Pliocene. Other fossil finds at the site suggest this High Arctic camel lived in a boreal type forest environment, during a global warm phase on the planet. This is an important discovery because it provides the first evidence of camels living in the High Arctic region, said lead author Dr Natalia Rybczynski from the Canadian Museum of Nature. It extends the previous range of camels in North America northward by about 1,200 km, and suggests that the lineage that gave rise to modern camels may been originally adapted to living in an Arctic forest environment. The camel bones were collected from a steep slope at the Fyles Leaf Bed site, a sandy deposit near Strathcona Fiord on Ellesmere Island. Fossils of leaves, wood and other plant material have been found at this site, but the camel is the first mammal recovered. A nearby fossil rich locality at Strathcona Fiord, known as the Beaver Pond site, has previously yielded fossils of other mammals from the same time period, including a badger, deerlet, beaver and three toed horse. The first time I picked up a piece, I thought that it might be wood. It was only back at the field camp that I was able to ascertain it was not only bone, but also from a fossil mammal larger than anything we had seen so far from the deposits, Dr Rybczynski said. Some important physical characteristics suggested the fossil fragments were part of a large tibia, the main lower leg bone in mammals, and that they belonged to the group of cloven hoofed animals known as arteriodactyls, which includes cows, pigs and camels. Digital files of each of the 30 bone fragments were produced using a 3D laser scanner, allowing for the pieces to be assembled and aligned. The size of the reconstituted leg bone suggested it was from a very large mammal. At the time in North America, the largest arteriodactyls were camels. Full confirmation that the bones belonged to a camel came from a new technique called collagen fingerprinting pioneered by Dr Mike Buckley at the University of Manchester in England. Profiles produced by this technique can be used to distinguish between groups of mammals. Fossil bones of the High Arctic camel \u00a9 Martin Lipman The collagen profile for the High Arctic camel most closely matched those of modern camels, specifically dromedaries camels with one hump as well as the Yukon giant camel, which is thought to be Paracamelus, the ancestor of modern camels. The collagen information, combined with the anatomical data, allowed the group to conclude that the Ellesmere bones belong to a camel, and is likely the same lineage as Paracamelus. We now have a new fossil record to better understand camel evolution, since our research shows that the Paracamelus lineage inhabited northern North America for millions of years, and the simplest explanation for this pattern would be that Paracamelus originated there. So perhaps some specializations seen in modern camels, such as their wide flat feet, large eyes and humps for fat may be adaptations derived from living in a polar environment. The group also reports for the first time an accurate age of both the Fyles Leaf Bed site and the Beaver Pond site  at least 3.4 million years old.

Life reconstruction of Culebrasuchus mesoamericanus, one of the two newly discovered prehistoric caimans, in its ancient near coastal environment during the early Miocene of Panama Danielle Byerley  Florida Museum of Natural History The uplift of the Isthmus of Panama 2.6 million years ago formed a land bridge that has long thought to be the crucial step in the interchange of animals between the Americas, including armadillos and giant sloths moving up into North America and relatives of modern horses, rabbits, foxes, pigs, cats, dogs, and elephants down into South America. The fossils, described in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, are partial skulls of two new species of caiman, relatives of alligators, who live exclusively in South America today. They were found in rocks dated from 19.83 and 19.12 million years old and that were exposed by excavations associated with the expansion of the Panama Canal. These are the first fossil crocodilian skulls recovered from all of Central America. They fill a gap in evolution between the alligators of North America and the caimans of South America. Its quite incredible, said lead author Dr Alex Hastings, a fossil crocodilian specialist at Georgia Southern University. The presence of the fossils in Panama indicates that caimans dispersed North from South America by the early Miocene, which is over ten million years earlier than the spread of mammals. This discovery is additionally important because caimans lack the ability to excrete excess salt from their bodies and are restricted to freshwater environments. As a result, they could have only dispersed a short distance across sea water, which supports a recent hypothesis that Central and South America were much closer to each other 19 million years ago than previously thought, and paints a new picture of the past histories of American animals. We are starting to understand that while the mammals in Panama 19 21 million years ago were very similar to those found in Mexico, Texas, and Florida at that time, the reptiles tell a different story, said co author Dr Jonathan Bloch, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Florida Museum of Natural History.

Bottom dinosaur fossils with bite marks made by crocodyliforms Boyd CA et al A large number of mostly tiny bits of dinosaur bones dating back to the late Cretaceous period were recovered within the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument in southern Utah leading paleontologists to believe that crocodyliforms  a now extinct relative of the crocodile family  had fed on baby dinosaurs. Evidence shows bite marks on bone joints, as well as breakthrough proof of a crocodyliform tooth still embedded in a dinosaur femur. The finds, described in the open access journal PLoS ONE, are significant because historically dinosaurs have been depicted as the dominant species. The traditional ideas you see in popular literature are that when little baby dinosaurs are either coming out of a nesting grounds or out somewhere on their own, they are normally having to worry about the theropod dinosaurs, the things like raptors or, on bigger scales, the T. rex. So this kind of adds a new dimension. You had your dominant riverine carnivores, the crocodyliforms, attacking these herbivores as well, so they kind of had it coming from all sides, explained lead author Prof Clint Boyd of the South Dakota School of Mines  Technology. Based on teeth marks left on bones and the large amounts of fragments left behind, it is believed the crocodyliforms were also diminutive in size, perhaps no more than 6.5 feet 2 m long. Until now, paleontologists had direct evidence only of very large crocodyliforms interacting with very large dinosaurs. Its not often that you get events from the fossil record that are action related, Prof Boyd said. While you generally assume there was probably a lot more interaction going on, we didnt have any of that preserved in the fossil record yet. This is the first time that we have definitive evidence that you had this kind of partitioning, of your smaller crocodyliforms attacking the smaller herbivorous dinosaurs. The high concentrations of tiny dinosaur bones led researchers to conclude a type of selection occurred, that crocodyliforms were preferentially feeding on these miniature dinosaurs. Maybe it was closer to a nesting ground where baby dinosaurs would have been more abundant, and so the smaller crocodyliforms were hanging out there getting a lunch, Prof Boyd said. The team also discovered through diagnostic cranial material that these baby prey are a new, as yet to be named dinosaur species. Details on this new species will soon be published in another paper.

No one could determine how these teeth  that look similar to a spiral saw blade  fit into a prehistoric fish with a poor fossil record, long assumed to be a species of a shark. New CT scans of a unique specimen from Idaho show the spiral of teeth within the jaws of the animal, giving new information on what the animal looked like, how it ate, said Prof Leif Tapanila of the Idaho Museum of Natural History and Idaho State University, lead author of a paper published in the journal Biology Letters.

Both of these species are fish with cartilage for a skeletal structure, rather than bone, but they are classified differently. It was always assumed that the Helicoprion was a shark, but it is more closely related to ratfish, a Holocephalan, Prof Tapanila said.

But before you start imagining T Rex in a bra, Prof Else said, dinosaur lactation, if it did in fact exist, would have involved secretions from the upper digestive tract that produce a milk like substance. Pigeons, emperor penguins and flamingos all produce milk like substances from crop glands or glands of the oesophagus that they feed to their young through their mouths. Since birds and dinosaurs share much in common I proposed that some dinosaurs likely used this feeding strategy. In the study, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, Prof Else argues that the greatest potential advantage of dinosaur lactation is that the milk fed to the young can be spiked with additives, such as antibodies, antioxidants and growth hormone. These are all examples of additives found in the milk of pigeons that allow their young to grow at phenomenal rates, Prof Else said, adding that his theory could help explain how dinosaurs grew so quickly. While there is no hard evidence of lactation in the fossil record of dinosaurs as the process would involve examining soft tissues, which are not preserved as fossils, Professor Else points to a case study he proposed  the herbivorous duckbills hadrosaurs. Hadrosaurs were herd, site breeders with nest bound young fed by parents. The proposal is that rather than regurgitating partially fermented plant matter these dinosaur parents initially used lactation then progressed to plant regurgitation. Although I work at the molecular level Im basically a comparative physiologist and one thing that always struck me as unresolved about dinosaurs was how a dinosaur parent of several tones could feed young of only a few kilograms. It seemed obvious, a form of lactation, similar to that present in birds.

An artists rendering of the hypothetical placental ancestor by Carl Buell Their study  the result of a multi year collaborative project  reveals that placental mammals did not diversify into their present day lineages until after the extinction event that eliminated about 70 percent of all species on our planet about 65 million years ago. This finding and the reconstruction of the placental ancestor were made with the help of a powerful cloud based and publicly accessible database called MorphoBank. Analysis of this massive dataset shows that placental mammals did not originate during the Mesozoic, said lead author Dr Maureen OLeary of Stony Brook University and the American Museum of Natural History. Species like rodents and primates did not share the Earth with non avian dinosaurs but arose from a common ancestor  a small, insect eating, scampering animal  shortly after the dinosaurs demise. There are two major types of data for building evolutionary trees of life phenomic data, observational traits such as anatomy and behavior and genomic data encoded by DNA. Some scholars have argued that integration of both is necessary for robust tree building because examining only one type of data leaves out significant information. The evolutionary history of placental mammals, for example, has been interpreted in very different ways depending on the data analyzed. One leading analysis based on genomic data alone predicted that a number of placental mammal lineages existed in the Late Cretaceous and survived the Cretaceous Paleogene KPg extinction. Other analyses place the start of placental mammals near this boundary, and still others set their origin after this event. There are over 5,100 living placental species and they exhibit enormous diversity, varying greatly in size, locomotor ability, and brain size, said study co author Dr Nancy Simmons of the American Museum of Natural History. Given this diversity, its of great interest to know when and how this clade first began evolving and diversifying.

The tree of life produced in the study shows that placental mammals arose rapidly after the KPg extinction, with the original ancestor speciating 200,000 400,000 years after the event. The new evolutionary tree for placental mammals, created by combining phenomic and genomic data Stony Brook University Luci Betti Nash This is about 36 million years later than the prediction based on purely genetic data, said co author Dr Marcelo Weksler of the Museu Nacional UFRJ in Brazil. The finding also contradicts a genomics based model called the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution that argues that the impetus for placental mammal speciation was the fragmentation of supercontinent Gondwana during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, millions of years earlier than the KPg event. The new tree indicates that the fragmentation of Gondwana came well before the origin of placental mammals and is an unrelated event, said co author Dr John Wible of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. As part of the study, researchers used MorphoBank to record phenomic traits for 86 placental mammal species, of which 40 were fossil species. The resulting dataset has more than 4,500 traits detailing characteristics such as the presence or absence of wings, teeth, and certain bones, type of hair cover, and structures found in the brain, as well as over 12,000 supporting images, all publicly available online. The team reconstructed the anatomy of the placental common ancestor by mapping traits onto the tree most strongly supported by the combined phenomic and genomic data and comparing the features in placental mammals with those seen in their closest relatives. This method, known as optimization, allowed the researchers to determine what features first appeared in the common ancestor of placental mammals and also what traits were retained unchanged from more distant ancestors. The researchers conclude that the common ancestor had features such as a two horned uterus, a brain with a convoluted cerebral cortex, and a placenta in which the maternal blood came in close contact with the membranes surrounding the fetus, as in humans.

This map shows places around the world where the fossils of large and small azhdarchids, including Eurazhdarcho langendorfensis, have been found in close proximity. It seems that many Late Cretaceous habitats were inhabited by two or even three different azhdarchid species, all differing in size and presumably in lifestyle and behavior. Bottom image shows a silhouette of the known bones of Eurazhdarcho in position Mark Witton  Ron Blakey  Colorado Plateau Geosystems, Inc 68 million year old fossil, named Eurazhdarcho langendorfensis, was collected from the Late Cretaceous rocks of Sebe\u015f Glod in the Transylvanian Basin, Romania. Eurazhdarcho belong to a group of pterosaurs called the azhdarchids. These were long necked, long beaked pterosaurs whose wings were strongly adapted for a soaring lifestyle. Several features of their wing and hind limb bones show that they could fold their wings up and walk on all fours when needed, said Dr Darren Naish of the University of Southampton, who helped identify the new species and co author a paper in the journal PLoS ONE. With a three meter wingspan, Eurazhdarcho would have been large, but not gigantic. This is true of many of the animals so far discovered in Romania they were often unusually small compared to their relatives elsewhere. The discovery is the most complete example of an azhdarchid found in Europe so far, and its discovery supports a long argued theory about the behavior of these types of creatures. Experts have argued for years over the lifestyle and behavior of azhdarchids. It has been suggested that they grabbed prey from the water while in flight, that they patrolled wetlands and hunted in a heron or stork like fashion, or that they were like gigantic sandpipers, hunting by pushing their long bills into mud, explained senior author Dr Gareth Dyke of the National Oceanography Center Southampton. One of the newest ideas is that azhdarchids walked through forests, plains and other places in search of small animal prey. Eurazhdarcho supports this view of azhdarchids, since these fossils come from an inland, continental environment where there were forests and plains as well as large, meandering rivers and swampy regions. Fossils from the region show that there were several places where both giant azhdarchids and small azhdarchids lived side by side. Eurazhdarchos discovery indicates that there were many different animals hunting different prey in the region at the same time, demonstrating a much more complicated picture of the Late Cretaceous world than first thought.

Sexual dimorphism in the pterosaur Darwinopterus University of Southampton The term sexual selection refers to the evolutionary pressures that relate to a species ability to repel rivals, meet mates and pass on genes. One can observe these processes happening in living animals but how do paleontologists know that sexual selection operated in fossil ones? Paleontologists have thought it challenging, even impossible, to recognize sexual selection in extinct animals. Many fossil animals have elaborate crests, horns, frills and other structures that look like they were used in sexual display but it can be difficult to distinguish these structures from those that might play a role in feeding behavior, escaping predators, controlling body temperature and so on. However in the new study, the paleontologists argue that clues in the fossil record can indeed be used to infer sexual selection. We see much evidence from the fossil record suggesting that sexual selection played a major role in the evolution of many extinct groups, said study co author Dr Darren Naish of the University of Southampton. Using observations of modern animal behavior we can draw analogies with extinct animals and infer how certain features improve success during courtship and breeding. Modern examples of sexual selection, where species have evolved certain behaviors or ornamentation that repel rivals and attract members of the opposite sex, include the male peacocks display of feathers, and the male mooses antlers for use in clashes during mating season. The fossil record holds many clues that point to the existence of sexual selection in extinct species, for example weaponry for fighting, bone fractures from duels, and ornamentation for display, such as fan shaped crests on dinosaurs. Distinct differences between males and females of a species, called sexual dimorphism, can also suggest the presence of sexual selection, and features observed in sexually mature adults, where absent from the young, indicate that their purpose might be linked to reproduction. Some scientists argue that many of the elaborate features on dinosaurs were not sexually selected at all, Dr Naish said. But as observations show that sexual selection is the most common process shaping evolutionary traits in modern animals, there is every reason to assume that things were exactly the same in the distant geological past.

Derek was able to expand our identification of small, two legged meat eaters that roamed Western Canada and the U.S. from seven species to at least 23,\u00a0Prof Currie said. These two legged dinosaurs ranged from the size of a chicken to two meters long. In most cases, tooth fossils are all that remains of small dinosaurs. Its the same situation you have in todays world with the remains of small animals like weasels, Prof Currie said. Because the bones are light and small in size, after the animal dies the bones scatter, and if theyre not covered by sand or mud they disintegrate very quickly. Luckily, the researchers do have fossilized skeletons with teeth for some of the small meat eaters. For example, Troodon is a two legged meat eater about 2 m in length, and Alberta is one area where its fossils have been found. We were able to link some previously unidentified fossilized teeth as being from relatives of Troodon, Prof Currie said. They were obviously similar teeth, but were not the same. Comparison with other species represented by teeth and bones gave the researchers a way to establish that other tooth samples also must have belonged to small dinosaur species that no one had previously identified. The researchers said the huge increase in the number of identified small meat eating species shows that instead of a few species existing for many millions of years, there were actually many small meat eating species, each existing for shorter time periods. Given that today there are more small animals than large, its really not surprising that during the age of the dinosaurs there were lots of small dinosaur species as well, Prof Currie concluded.

An artists reconstruction of Eosinopteryx Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences Over many years, it has become accepted among paleontologists that birds evolved from a group of dinosaurs called theropods from the Early Cretaceous period of Earths history, around 120 130 million years ago. Recent discoveries of feathered dinosaurs from the older Middle Late Jurassic period have reinforced this theory. The newly found feathered, small bodied dinosaur about 30 cm in length, called Eosinopteryx brevipenna, and described this week in Nature Communications, provides additional evidence to this effect. This discovery sheds further doubt on the theory that the famous fossil Archaeopteryx  or first bird as it is sometimes referred to  was pivotal in the evolution of modern birds, said co author Dr Gareth Dyke of the University of Southampton, UK. Our findings suggest that the origin of flight was much more complex than previously thought. Eosinopteryx brevipenna Pascal Godefroit et al The Eosinopteryx fossil from China indicates that, while feathered, this was a flightless dinosaur, because of its small wingspan and a bone structure that would have restricted its ability to flap its wings. Eosinopteryx also had toes suited to walking along the ground and fewer feathers on its tail and lower legs, which would have made it easier to run.

It was about 28 feet 8.6 m in length, had a massive skull and jaws armed with large teeth with cutting edges used to seize and slice through other marine reptiles in the Triassic seas.

An artists reconstruction of Sulcavis geeorum in flight Stephanie Abramowicz According to a study published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, the enantiornithine bird named Sulcavis geeorum had a durophagous diet  its teeth were capable of eating prey with hard exoskeletons like insects or crabs. Enantiornithine birds are an early group of birds, and the most numerous birds from the Mesozoic  the time of the dinosaurs. Sulcavis lived during the Early Cretaceous about 121 125 million years ago in what is now China. Paleontologists believe the teeth of the new specimen greatly increase the known diversity of tooth shape in early birds, and hints at previously unrecognized ecological diversity. Sulcavis is the first discovery of a bird with ornamented tooth enamel. The dinosaurs  from which birds evolved  are mostly characterized by carnivorous teeth with special features for eating meat. The enantiornithines are unique among birds in showing minimal tooth reduction and a diversity of dental patterns. Sulcavis had robust teeth with grooves on the inside surface, which likely strengthened the teeth against harder food items. No previous bird species have preserved ridges, striations, serrated edges, or any other form of dental ornamentation. While other birds were losing their teeth, enantiornithines were evolving new morphologies and dental specializations.

Artists impression of Similicaudipteryx using its tail feathers in a mating display Sydney Mohr A team of paleontologists, led by Scott Persons of the University of Alberta, followed a chain of fossil evidence that started with a peculiar fusing together of vertebrae at the tip of the tail of four different species of dinosaurs, some separated in time and evolution by 45 million years. The final vertebrae in the tails of a group of dinosaurs called oviraptors were fused together, forming a ridged, blade like structure, Persons said. The structure is called a pygostyle. Among modern animals, only birds have them. Fossils of the early oviraptor Similicaudipteryx reveal feathers radiating from the fused bones at the tail tip. Similicaudipteryx was not known to be a flying dinosaur, and its tail feathers evolved as a means of waving its feathered tail fans. No direct fossil evidence of feathers has been found with the fossils of the oviraptors that followed Similicaudipteryx, but Persons explained there is still strong evidence they had a feathered tail. The study appears in the journal Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. Because the later oviraptor had the same tail structure as the feathered Similicaudipteryx, the tails of later oviraptors still served the same purpose, Persons said. The hypothesis of oviraptor tail waving is supported by both the bone and muscle structure of the tail. Individual vertebrae at the base of an oviraptors tail were short and numerous, indicating great flexibility. Based on dissections of modern reptile and bird tails, the reconstruction of the dinosaurs tail muscles revealed oviraptors had what it took to really shake their tail feathers. Large muscles extended far down the tail and had a sufficient number of broad connection points to the vertebrae to propel oviraptors tail feathers vigorously from side to side and up and down. Oviraptors were two legged dinosaurs that had already gone through major diversifications from the iconic, meat eating dinosaur family. They were plant eaters that roamed parts of China, Mongolia and Alberta during the Cretaceous period, the final age of the dinosaur. By this time, a variety of dinosaurs used feathers for flight and insulation from the cold, Persons said. This shows that by the late Cretaceous, dinosaurs were doing everything with feathers that modern birds do now. In addition to feathered tail waving, oviraptors also had prominent bone crests on their head, which the dinosaurs also may have used in mating displays. Between the crested head and feathered tail shaking, oviraptors had a propensity for visual exhibitionism, Persons concluded.

The saber toothed cat Smilodon fatalis Charles R. Knight The saber toothed cat Smilodon fatalis and American lion Panthera atrox were among the largest terrestrial carnivores that lived during their time, and went extinct along with other large animals approximately 12,000 years ago. Previous studies have suggested many reasons for their extinction, including a changing climate, human activity and competition from humans and other animals for food, which may have grown scarce as a result of these changes. It is known that when prey is scarce, large carnivores may gnaw prey to the bone, wearing their teeth down in the process. The current study, conducted by a team of scientists headed by Dr Larisa DeSantis of Vanderbilt University, has revealed that saber toothed cats did not resort to this behavior just before extinction, suggesting that lack of prey was probably not the main reason they became extinct. In contrast, American lions did not consume much bone even near extinction, and had tooth wear patterns similar to cheetahs, who actively avoid bone in their prey. Tooth wear patterns suggest that these cats were not desperately consuming entire carcasses, as was expected, and instead seemed to be living the good life during the late Pleistocene, at least up until the very end, Dr DeSantis said.

Even at their small body sizes, diet studies indicate that piranhas will attack and bite chunks of bony fins and flesh from prey many times larger than themselves.

Prof Orti and colleagues participated in a 2010 expedition to the Xingu and Iriri rivers in Amazonia to collect the data on the black piranha. The study, published in the Scientific Reports, reveals the bite force of the megapiranha identified in 2009, showing that for its relatively diminutive body size, the bite of this fossil species dwarfed that of other extinct mega predators, including the whale eating shark and the Devonian placoderm. The study also reports the first bite force measurements taken from wild specimens of the black piranha, and describes the underlying functional morphology of the jaws that allows this creature to bite with a force more than 30 times greater than its weight. The powerful bite is achieved primarily due to the large muscle mass of the black piranhas jaw and the efficient transmission of its large contractile forces through a highly modified jaw closing lever. It was very exciting to participate in this project, travel one more time to the Amazon to be able to directly measure bite forces in the wild, said Dr. Orti.

The 4 mm long fossil is a predatory larva of the order Neuroptera. It is covered by a tangle of plant filaments that it collected with its jaws to form a defensive shield and camouflage itself. This survival strategy, sometimes called the trash carrying, is observed in current species to render them nearly undetectable to predators and prey. It was found in a piece of amber unearthed in 2008 in the El Soplao outcrop in Cantabria, Spain, the Mesozoics richest and largest amber site in Europe.

The name alludes to its mind blowing appearance and its resemblance to Diogenes syndrome, a human behavioral disorder characterized by compulsive hoarding of trash, the scientists said. The study identified the filamentous plant remains composing the larval trash packet as trichomes, or plant hairs with diverse shapes and functions. The trichomes are thought to belong to a specific group of ancient ferns. Today green lacewing larvae harvest plant materials or even detritus and arthropod remains and carry them on their backs, nestled among small tubercles with hairs. On the contrary, Hallucinochrysa diogenesi possessed a bizarre characteristic it possessed extremely elongate tubercles, with hairs that had trumpet shaped endings acting as anchoring points.

The ostracods and associated marine animals living there were covered by a fall of volcanic ash that preserved them frozen in time. Pauline avibella is special because it is exceptionally well preserved, complete with not only the shell but also the soft parts  its body, limbs, eyes, gills and alimentary system. Such discoveries are extremely rare in the fossil record. Prof David Siveter of the University of Leicester, lead author of a paper in the Proceedings of The Royal Society B, said the two ostracod specimens discovered represent a genus and species new to science, named Pauline avibella. The genus is named in honor of a special person Pauline Siveter, late wife of the lead author and avibella means beautiful bird, so named because of the fancied resemblance of a prominent feature of the shell to the wing of a bird. Ostracods are the most abundant fossil arthropods, occurring ubiquitously as bivalved shells in rocks of the last 490 million years, and are common in most water environments today. The find is important because it is one of only a handful preserving the fossilized soft tissues of ostracods. Its assignment to a particular group of ostracods based on knowledge of its biology is at odds with its shell form, thus urging caution in interpreting the classification of fossil ostracods based on shell characters alone. The preservation of soft parts of animals is a very rare occurrence in the fossil record and allows unparalleled insight into the ancient biology, community structure and evolution of animals  key facts that that would otherwise be lost to science. The fossils known from the Herefordshire site show soft part preservation and are of global importance. The fossils were reconstructed virtually, by using a technique that involves grinding each specimen down, layer by layer, and photographing it at each stage. 10 mm is relatively tiny, but at an incremental level of 20 micrometers that yields 500 slices, which can then be pieced together in a computer to provide a full, three dimensional image of each fossil, outside and in. Fossil discoveries in general help elucidate our own place in the tree of life. This discovery adds another piece of knowledge in the jigsaw of understanding the diversity and evolution of animals. It is exciting to discover that a common group of fossils that we thought we knew a lot about may well have been hood winking us as to their true identity, which we now realize because we have their beautifully fossilized soft parts.

In the foreground, the carnivorous lizard Palaeosaniwa stalks a pair of hatchling Edmontosaurus as the snake Cerberophis and the lizard Obamadon look on. In the background, an encounter between T. rex and Triceratops Carl Buell The asteroid event is typically thought of as affecting the dinosaurs primarily, explained Dr Nicholas Longrich of the Yales Department of Geology and Geophysics and lead author on the study. But it basically cut this broad swath across the entire ecosystem, taking out everything. Snakes and lizards were hit extremely hard. Earlier studies have suggested that some snake and lizard species extinct after the asteroid struck Earth 65.5 million years ago. But the new study argues that consequences of the collision were far more serious for snakes and lizards than previously understood. As many as 83 percent of all snake and lizard species died off, researchers said, and the bigger the creature, the more likely it was to become extinct, with no species larger than one pound surviving. The results are based on a detailed examination of previously collected snake and lizard fossils covering a territory in western North America. The authors examined 21 previously known species and also identified seven new lizards  Obamadon gracilis, Pariguana lancensis, Tripennaculus, Socognathus brachyodon, Lonchisaurus trichurus, Cemeterius monstrosus, Lamiasaurus ferox  and two snake species. They found that a remarkable range of reptile species lived in the last days of the dinosaurs. Some were tiny lizards. One snake was the size of a boa constrictor, large enough to take the eggs and young of many dinosaur species. Iguana like plant eating lizards inhabited the southwest, while carnivorous lizards hunted through the swamps and flood plains of what is now Montana, some of them up to six feet long. Fossil dentary of the newly identified lizard Obamadon gracilis Nicholas Longrich et al The scientists then conducted a detailed analysis of the relationships of these reptiles, showing that many represented archaic lizard and snake families that disappeared at the end of the Cretaceous, following the asteroid strike. One of the most diverse lizard branches wiped out was the Polyglyphanodontia. This broad category of lizards included up to 40 percent of all lizards then living in North America. In reassessing previously collected fossils, they came across an unnamed species and called it Obamadon gracilis. It is a small polyglyphanodontian distinguished by tall, slender teeth with large central cusps separated from small accessory cusps by lingual grooves, the team wrote. The genus name refers to Barack Hussein Obama and odon tooth in Greek, in reference to the tall, straight teeth, and the manner in which Mr Obama has acted as a role model of good oral hygiene for the world. The creature likely measured less than one foot long and probably ate insects, Dr Longrich explained. No one should impute any political significance to the decision to name the extinct lizard after the recently re elected U.S. president. Were just having fun with taxonomy.

Culiseta kishenehn, left, and Culiseta lemniscata Harbach RE et al  Zootaxa Ancient mosquitoes are very rare and the total number of species identified is now 26. The newly identified species, called Culiseta kishenehn and Culiseta lemniscata, lived on Earth during the Eocene epoch about 46 million years ago. They are the first compression fossils identified from the genus Culiseta. They are produced in rock that is compressed over time, often creating animal fossils that are distorted, unlike the body fossils you get with amber where the whole body is often nicely preserved. The team was able to spot minute details that distinguish one mosquito species from another, such as wing veins from 0.5 to 1.5 mm long, to minuscule setae, the hair like structures near the base of the wing. But is it possible that these fossil mosquitoes from the time of the Eocene epoch could also contain blood? Compression fossils are generally less informative morphologically than specimens preserved in amber, said Dr Ralph Harbach of the Natural History Museum in London, lead author of a paper reporting the new species in the journal Zootaxa. It is probably less likely for blood to be detected in compression fossils, but it should be possible. Blood has already been found in fossil mosquitoes of a similar age to the new finds. A species in the genus Culex preserved in 45 15 million year old Dominican amber had blood that contained bird malaria parasites. Some scientists think that human malarial parasites, which are transmitted by the Anopheles mosquitoes, arose by transfer from birds to humans. And it was in another amber fossil that the oldest fossil mosquito, Burmaculex antiquus, was found  the Burmese amber was from the mid Cretaceous. So, what kind of viruses might the new ancient mosquitoes have carried? Although 46 million years old, they look very similar to some living species of the same genus Culiseta, Dr Harbach said. Culiseta kishenehn bears close resemblance to the living North American Culiseta melanura, which is a vector of Eastern and Western equine encephalitis viruses EEE and WEE. These viruses quickly infect the brains of horses and cause paralysis and very often death. EEE can infect amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, including humans. And there is currently no cure for the human form which is sometimes fatal, Dr Harbach said. There were no horses or humans during the Eocene epoch and many living species of Culiseta feed on birds. So these ancient mosquitoes probably fed on birds too, he said. However, mosquitoes are basically opportunistic and will feed on other types of animals if their preferred hosts are unavailable. Since some of todays mosquitoes also feed on reptiles, could the more ancient mosquitoes have sucked from a dinosaur? Dr Harbach said its possible. Evidence suggests mosquitoes evolved in the Jurassic Period 200 146 million years ago. If the early ancestral mosquitoes had already evolved to feed on blood, it is conceivable that they may have fed on dinosaurs. Bibliographic information Harbach RE et al. 2012.

According to the scientists, this creature, named Nyasasaurus parringtoni, roamed our planet about 245 million years ago. This is an artists rendering of Nyasasaurus parringtoni \u00a9Mark Witton  Natural History Museum, London The discovery, described in a paper in the journal Biology Letters, means that dinosaurs appeared about 10  15 million years earlier than fossils previously showed, originating in the Middle Triassic rather than in the Late Triassic period. If the newly named Nyasasaurus parringtoni is not the earliest dinosaur, then it is the closest relative found so far, said lead author Dr Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Washington. The scientific name of the new genus Nyasasaurus combines the lake name Nyasa with the term saurus for lizard. The late paleontologist Alan Charig, included as a co author on the paper, named the specimen but never documented or published in a way that was formally recognized. The species was named Parringtoni in honor of University of Cambridges Rex Parrington, who collected the specimens in the 1930s. For 150 years, people have been suggesting that there should be Middle Triassic dinosaurs, but all the evidence is ambiguous. Some scientists used fossilized footprints, but we now know that other animals from that time have a very similar foot. Other scientists pointed to a single dinosaur like characteristic in a single bone, but that can be misleading because some characteristics evolved in a number of reptile groups and are not a result of a shared ancestry. The fossilized bones of N. parringtoni were collected in the 1930s from Tanzania, but it may not be correct to say dinosaurs originated in that country. When this dinosaur lived, the worlds continents were joined in the landmass called Pangaea. Tanzania would have been part of Southern Pangaea that included Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia. The researchers had one humerus  or upper arm bone  and six vertebrae to work with. They determined that the animal likely stood upright, measured 7 to 10 feet in length 2 to 3 meters, was as tall as 3 feet at the hip 1 meter and may have weighed between 45 and 135 pounds 20 to 60 kilograms. The new findings place the early evolution of dinosaurs and dinosaur like reptiles firmly in the southern continents, said co author Dr Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum, London. Nyasasaurus and its age have important implications regardless of whether this taxon is a dinosaur or the closest relatives of dinosaurs, Dr Nesbitt said. It establishes that dinosaurs likely evolved earlier than previously expected and refutes the idea that dinosaur diversity burst onto the scene in the Late Triassic, a burst of diversification unseen in any other groups at that time. It now appears that dinosaurs were just part of a large diversification of archosaurs. Archosaurs were among the dominant land animals during the Triassic period 250 million to 200 million years ago and include dinosaurs, crocodiles and their kin. Dinosaurs are just part of this archosaur diversification, an explosion of new forms soon after the Permian extinction, Dr Nesbitt said.

This is an artists reconstruction of Nimbadon mother and juvenile Peter Schouten Because of their large size and abundance in the fossil record, it has generally been accepted that most diprotodontoids an extinct family of large, actively mobile marsupials were terrestrial and roamed in herds or mobs like modern day kangaroos, Dr Black explained. Our study has turned many of these long held preconceptions about the lifestyles of these marsupials literally on their heads. We compared some exceptionally well preserved Nimbadon skeletons from a fossil cave in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area with those of a range of modern and extinct mammals of varying lifestyles. Strikingly, we found Nimbadons skeleton  in particular its limbs, hands and feet  to be most similar to that of the living koala. Like the koala, Nimbadon possessed powerful forelimbs with highly mobile shoulder and elbow joints that would have allowed significant extension and rotation of the arms, an essential trait for climbing through a tree canopy and for balancing on tree branches. Nimbadons hands and feet were extremely large, with long, flexible fingers and toes and semi opposable first digits. Combined with the deep carpal tunnel of the wrist, it probably possessed an exceptionally powerful grasp. Nimbadons massive, sharp, recurved claws on its hands and feet were identical to those of the koala  but far larger  and could deeply penetrate a tree trunk during climbing. Our study showed that claws of this kind are only found in species that live in or regularly climb trees, Dr Black said. The numerous similarities between koala and Nimbadon skeletons suggest they functioned in much the same way and that Nimbadon used a trunk hugging climbing method. Nimbadon had the shortest hind limbs relative to its forelimbs of any known marsupial. Those same limb proportions are found today in animals such as sloths and some apes that regularly hang by their forelimbs from tree branches. It is a behavior no longer regularly used by any marsupial. Like some tree climbing bears, its possible that Nimbadon may have supplemented its diet with fruit and possibly played a role as a large seed disperser in Australias ancient forests. Its climbing ability would have allowed it access to multiple layers of the rainforest canopy, perhaps to reduce competition for resources with terrestrial kangaroos and also for protection from predators. These findings were published online in the journal PLoS ONE. Our study indicates that modern Australian ecosystems have suffered an even greater loss in ecological diversity than previously expected, Dr Black concluded.

Orliac  Antoine P O et al The fossil was found near Karaca\u015far in Cappadocia, Central Turkey. It is thought to be that of the large two horned rhino Ceratotherium neumayri common in the Eastern Mediterranean region during the late Miocene period. Unusual features of the preserved skull suggest that the animal was cooked to death at temperatures that may have approached 500 degrees C, in a volcanic flow similar to that of the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in Italy in 79 A.D., said the authors of a paper describing the find in the journal PLoS ONE. The rhinos grisly death was near instantaneous, and followed by severe dehydration in the extreme heat of the eruption. The body was baked under a temperature approximating 400 degrees C, then dismembered within the pyroclastic flow, and the skull separated from body, the scientists described. The flow of volcanic ash then moved the skull about 30 km north of the eruption site, where it was discovered by the team led by Dr Pierre Olivier Antoine of the University of Montpellier, France. Although other researchers have previously identified fossils of soft bodied organisms preserved in volcanic ash, organic matter near an active volcanic eruption is usually quickly destroyed by the high temperatures, making a fossil such as this one extremely rare.

This illustration shows the Miocene mammal Necrolestes patagonensis venturing out of its burrow 16 million years ago in Patagonia, present day Argentina. Necrolestes is now recognized as a member of a group long thought to have become extinct shortly after the extinction of the large dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period Jorge Gonzalez  Guillermo Rougier Since its discovery in Patagonia in 1891, Necrolestes has been a paleontological riddle for more than 120 years. Necrolestes is one of those animals in the textbooks that would appear with a picture and a footnote, and the footnote would say we dont know what it is, said Dr John Wible of Carnegie Museum of Natural History, co author of the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Despite being excellently preserved, the mysterious fossils moved from institution to institution and researcher to researcher, the classification of Necrolestes changing with each new move. As recently as a few years ago, the creature still could not be definitively classified in a mammal group. A 2008 study led to hypothesis that Necrolestes was a marsupial. This classification intrigued study co author Dr Guillermo Rougier of the University of Louisville, Kentucky. As a specialist in South American mammals, he was not convinced that the marsupial identification was accurate, and embarked on his own attempt to make a classification. This project was a little daunting, because we had to contradict 100 years of interpretation, Dr Rougier said. The team uncovered characteristics of the Necrolestes skull anatomy that had previously gone unnoted, and came to the groundbreaking realization that Necrolestes belonged to neither the marsupial nor placental lineages to which it had historically been linked. Rather, Necrolestes actually belonged in a completely unexpected branch of the evolutionary tree which was thought to have died out 45 million years earlier than the time of Necrolestes. In 2011, Dr Rougier discovered an extinct mammal Cronopio, which belonged to the Meridiolestida, a little known group of mammals found in South America in the Late Cretaceous and early Paleocene some 10060 million years ago. The team found that Cronopio and Necrolestes share many features in common, including the fact that they are the only known mammals to have single rooted molars. This conclusively showed that Necrolestes was neither a marsupial nor a placental mammal, and was in fact the last remaining member of the Meridiolestida lineage, thought to have gone extinct 45 million years earlier. If we didnt know those fossils, said Dr Wible of Cronopio, we might have come to the same conclusion that everybody else had  that the relationships of Necrolestes were unknowable. The mass extinction that ended the Age of Dinosaurs wiped out thousands of species. Included in the devastation were the Meridiolestida, the mammal group to which Cronopio and Necrolestes belong, cutting short their evolutionary lineage  or so scientists thought. Before the conclusive identification of Necrolestes, only one member of the Meridiolestida was known to have survived the extinction event, and that species died out soon after, early in the Tertiary Period 651.8 million years ago. Necrolestes is therefore the only remaining member of a supposedly extinct group. Its the supreme Lazarus effect, Dr Wible said. How in the world did this animal survive so long without anyone knowing about it? In the Lazarus effect, a species previously thought to be extinct is rediscovered  sometimes living, sometimes elsewhere in the fossil record. The Lazarus effect is well represented by the ginkgo tree, thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered growing in China in the 17th century.

This is an artists reconstruction of Kretzoiarctos beatrix, formerly known as Agriarctos beatrix SINC In May 2012, Dr Juan Abella and colleagues from the Spains National Museum of Natural Sciences and the Catalan Institute of Paleontology announced the discovery of a new fossil species of bear that roamed what is now Spain in the Miocene period. On the basis of fossil teeth found at the Nombrevilla 2 site in the province of Zaragoza, the species was assigned to the genus Agriarctos and named A. beatrix. The discovery was described in a paper in the journal Estudios Geol\u00f3gicos. In a new study, published November 14 online in the journal PloS ONE, Dr Abellas team describes a newly found jaw fossil from the Vall\u00e8s Pened\u00e8s Basin and suggests that the species is distinct enough as to be attributed to a different genus. The new genus we describe in this paper is not only the first bear recorded in the Iberian Peninsula, but also the first of the giant pandas lineage, Dr Abella said. For the new genus, the name Kretzoiarctos was chosen to honor the paleontologist Mikl\u00f3s Kretz arctos being Greek for bear. According to the team, Kretzoiarctos beatrix bears the characteristics of a bear adapted to eating tough plant material like bamboo. The giant panda, native to certain parts of China, is the only living member of this unique bear family with these dietary habits. This new genus represents the oldest and most basal member of the ursid clade currently represented by Ailuropoda, thus being of utmost significance for understanding the origin of the giant panda lineage from both a chronological and paleobiogeographic perspectives, Dr Abella and his colleagues reported in the PloS ONE paper.

This image shows a 4.5 million year old skull of the Hubbells white shark, Carcharodon hubbelli Jeff Gage  Florida Museum of Natural History Originally classified as a direct relative of megatooth sharks, evolutionary history of the great white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, has been debated by paleontologists for the last 150 years. A new study published in the journal Palaeontology deviates from the white sharks original classification as a relative of megatooth sharks such as the extinct Carcharocles megalodon, the largest carnivorous shark that ever lived. Using zircon U Pb dating and strontium ratio isotopic analysis, the scientists have concluded that the new shark species, named Carcharodon hubbelli, lived about 6 8 million years ago during the late Miocene  at least\u00a02 million years earlier than previously believed. We can look at white sharks today a little bit differently ecologically if we know that they come from a mako shark ancestor, said lead author Dr Dana Ehret of Monmouth University in New Jersey. That 2 million year pushback is pretty significant because in the evolutionary history of white sharks, that puts this species in a more appropriate time category to be ancestral or kind of an intermediate form of white shark. Most ancient shark species are named using isolated teeth, but analysis of C. hubbelli, also known as Hubbells white shark, was based on a complete set of jaws with 222 teeth intact and 45 vertebrae. The species was named for Gainesville resident Gordon Hubbell, a collector who recovered the fossils from a farmer who discovered them in the Pisco Formation of southern Peru in 1988. Hubbell donated the specimens to the Florida Museum of Natural History in December 2009. The impetus of this project was really the fact that Gordon Hubbell donated a majority of his fossil shark collection to the Florida Museum, Dr Ehret said. Naming the shark in his honor is a small tip of the hat to all the great things he has done to advance paleontology. The same team published an initial study describing the shark specimens in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology in 2009 full paper in pdf, but dates for the site reflected information from a 1985 study about the Pisco Formation. With Hubbells hand drawn maps and descriptions of the landscape, researchers returned to the site and found the exact spot the fossils were discovered. The team extracted more accurate age estimates from mollusk shells in the fossil horizon to determine the shark species was from the late Miocene, about 6.5 million years ago, rather than the early Pliocene, about 4.5 million years ago. The new dates will also be useful for better understanding other fossils found in the rich Pisco Formation, which include new whale, marine sloth and terrestrial vertebrate species. The paleontologists determined Hubbells white shark was related to ancient broad toothed mako sharks by comparing the physical shapes of shark teeth to one another. While modern white sharks have serrations on their teeth for consuming marine mammals, mako sharks do not have serrations because they primarily feed on fish. Hubbells white shark has coarse serrations indicative of a transition from broad toothed mako sharks to modern white sharks.

Xenoceratops means alien horned face, referring to the strange pattern of horns on its head and the scarcity of horned dinosaur fossils from this part of the fossil record, it also honors the Village of Foremost, located close to where the fossils were found. The dinosaur was about 20 feet 6 meters long and weighed more than 2 tons. It had a parrot like beak with two long brow horns above its eyes, a large frill protruded from the back of its skull featuring two huge spikes. Xenoceratops is the oldest known large bodied horned dinosaur from Canada, about 0.5 million years older than Albertaceratops discovered in 2007. Starting 80 million years ago, the large bodied horned dinosaurs in North America underwent an evolutionary explosion, said Dr Michael Ryan of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, lead author of a paper describing the dinosaur in the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences. Xenoceratops shows us that even the geologically oldest ceratopsids had massive spikes on their head shields and that their cranial ornamentation would only become more elaborate as new species evolved. Xenoceratops provides new information on the early evolution of ceratopsids, the group of large bodied horned dinosaurs that includes Triceratops, added co author Dr David Evans of the Royal Ontario Museum and University of Toronto. The early fossil record of ceratopsids remains scant, and this discovery highlights just how much more there is to learn about the origin of this diverse group. The dinosaur is described from skull fragments from at least three individuals from the Foremost Formation originally collected by Dr Wann Langston Jr. in the 1950s, and is currently housed in the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, Canada. Dr Ryan and Dr Evans stumbled upon the undescribed material more than a decade ago and recognized the bones as a new type of horned dinosaur. Dr Evans later discovered a 50 year old plaster field jacket at the Canadian Museum of Nature containing more skull bones from the same fossil locality and had them prepared in his lab at the Royal Ontario Museum. This discovery of a previously unknown species also drives home the importance of having access to scientific collections, said co author Dr Kieran Shepherd of the Canadian Museum of Nature. The collections are an untapped source of new material for study, and offer the potential for many new discoveries.

This picture depicts how the region of Cerro de los Batallones in central Spain likely looked 9 million years ago Mauricio Ant\u00f3n The paleontologists analyzed the tooth enamel of fossil teeth of a leopard sized Promegantereon ogygia, lion sized Machairodus aphanistus and a bear dog. The findings appear today in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The team conducted whats called a stable carbon isotope analysis on the animals teeth. Using a dentists drill with a diamond bit, they sampled teeth from 69 specimens, including plant eaters and predators  27 saber toothed cats and bear dogs. They isolated the carbon from the tooth enamel and, using a mass spectrometer, measured the ratio of the more massive carbon 13 molecules to the less massive carbon 12. Carbon 12 and 13 are both present in the carbon dioxide that plants take in during photosynthesis. Different plants make use of the isotopes in different ways, and so they retain different amounts of them in their fibers. When an herbivore eats a plant, that plant leaves an isotopic signature in the animals bones and teeth. The signature travels through the food chain and can be found in carnivores as well. This would be the same in your tooth enamel today, said lead author Dr Soledad Domingo of the University of Michigans Museum of Paleontology. If we sampled them, we could have an idea of what you eat. Its a signature that remains through time. Because the paleontologists can tell what the herbivores ate, they can surmise what their habitat was like. They found that cat species P. ogygia and M. aphanistus lived together in a woodland area. The predators likely hunted the same prey horses and wild boar. In this habitat, the small saber toothed cats could have used tree cover to avoid encountering the larger ones. Bear dogs likely hunted antelope in a more open area that overlapped the cats territory, but was slightly separated. These three animals were sympatric  they inhabited the same geographic area at the same time. What they did to coexist was to avoid each other and partition the resources, Dr Domingo explained. The three largest mammalian predators captured prey in different portions of the habitat, as do coexisting large predators today. So even though none of the species in this 9 million year old ecosystem are still alive today, we found evidence for similar ecological interactions as in modern ecosystems, said study co author Prof Catherine Badgley of the University of Michigans Museum of Paleontology.

The Cretaceous geologic period extended from 146 million years ago to 66 million years ago. The paleontologist named the new species Reidus hilli for Robert T. Hill, a geologist with the US Geological Survey who led surveys of Texas during the 1800s. Hill described much of the geology of Texas, including the Duck Creek Formation. Hill is acclaimed as the Father of Texas Geology. R. hilli is now the youngest coelacanth identified in Texas, previously the youngest was a 200 million year old coelacanth from the Triassic. The specimen came from the Duck Creek Formation, which is a layer cake band of limestone and shale about 40 feet thick. The fossil was found in marine sediments, Graf said. It is one of many marine fossils found in the North Texas area, which 100 million years ago was covered by the Western Interior Seaway that divided North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. That is unique to younger coelacanths, Graf said. The oldest coelacanths were usually found in freshwater deposits and it wasnt until the Cretaceous that we start seeing this transition into a more marine environment. Identification of R. hilli brings the number of coelacanth species worldwide to 81, including two that are alive today.

This image shows a nearly intact fossil of Fuxianhuia protensa Xiaoya Ma  Nicholas Strausfeld Embedded in mudstones deposited during the Cambrian period 520 million years ago in what today is the Yunnan Province in China, the approximately 3 inch long fossil, which belongs to the species Fuxianhuia protensa, represents an extinct lineage of arthropods combining an advanced brain anatomy with a primitive body plan. The fossil provides a missing link that sheds light on the evolutionary history of arthropods, the taxonomic group that comprises crustaceans, arachnids and insects. The researchers call their find a transformative discovery that could resolve a long standing debate about how and when complex brains evolved. No one expected such an advanced brain would have evolved so early in the history of multicellular animals, said Prof Nicholas Strausfeld, a neurobiologist with the University of Arizona and lead author of a paper describing the discovery in the journal Nature. Paleontologists and evolutionary biologists have yet to agree on exactly how arthropods evolved, especially on what the common ancestor looked like that gave rise to insects. There has been a very long debate about the origin of insects. Until now, scientists have favored one of two scenarios. Some believe that insects evolved from the an ancestor that gave rise to the malacostracans, a group of crustaceans that include crabs and shrimp, while others point to a lineage of less commonly known crustaceans called branchiopods, which include, for example, brine shrimp. Because the brain anatomy of branchiopods is much simpler than that of malacostracans, they have been regarded as the more likely ancestors of the arthropod lineage that would give rise to insects. However, the discovery of a complex brain anatomy in an otherwise primitive organism such as Fuxianhuia makes this scenario unlikely. The shape matches that of a comparable sized modern malacostracan, the authors write in the paper. The fossil supports the hypothesis that branchiopod brains evolved from a previously complex to a more simple architecture instead of the other way around.  This hypothesis arose from neurocladistics, a field pioneered by Prof Strausfeld that attempts to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among organisms based on the anatomy of their nervous system. Conventional cladistics, on the other hand, usually look to an organisms overall morphology or molecular data such as DNA sequences. I spent a frenetic five hours at the dissecting microscope, the last hours of my visit there, photographing, photographing, photographing, he said. And I realized that this brain actually comprises three successive neuropils in the optic regions, which is a trait of malacostracans, not branchiopods. Neuropils are portions of the arthropod brain that serve particular functions, such as collecting and processing input from sensory organs. For example, scent receptors in the antennae are wired to the olfactory neuropils, while the eyes connect to neuropils in the optic lobes. When Prof Strausfeld traced the fossilized outlines of Fuxianhuias brain, he realized it had three optic neuropils on each side that once were probably connected by nerve fibers in crosswise pattern as occurs in insects and malacostracans. The brain was also composed of three fused segments, whereas in branchiopods only two segments are fused. In branchiopods, there are always only two visual neuropils and they are not linked by crossing fibers, Prof Strausfeld said. In principle, Fuxianhuias is a very modern brain in an ancient animal. The fossil supports the idea that once a basic brain design had evolved, it changed little over time. Instead, peripheral components such as the eyes, the antennae and other appendages, sensory organs, etc., underwent great diversification and specialized in different tasks but all plugged into the same basic circuitry. It is remarkable how constant the ground pattern of the nervous system has remained for probably more than 550 million years, Prof Strausfeld said. The basic organization of the computational circuitry that deals, say, with smelling, appears to be the same as the one that deals with vision, or mechanical sensation.

This is the only fossil ever discovered that shows a spider attacking prey in its web. Preserved in amber, its about 100 million years old Oregon State University This piece of amber preserved the event in remarkable detail, an action that took place some 100 million years ago in the Hukawng Valley of Myanmar. The fossil also contains the body of a male spider in the same web. This provides the oldest evidence of social behavior in spiders, which still exists in some species but is fairly rare. Most spiders have solitary, often cannibalistic lives, and males will not hesitate to attack immature species in the same web. This juvenile spider was going to make a meal out of a tiny parasitic wasp, but never quite got to it, said Prof George Poinar Jr. of the Oregon State University and world expert on insects trapped in amber, who co authored a paper in the Historical Biology An International Journal of Paleobiology. This was a male wasp that suddenly found itself trapped in a spider web, Prof Poinar said. This was the wasps worst nightmare, and it never ended. The wasp was watching the spider just as it was about to be attacked, when tree resin flowed over and captured both of them. Spiders are ancient invertebrates that researchers believe date back some 200 million years, but the oldest fossil evidence ever found of a spider web is only about 130 million years old. An actual attack such as this between a spider and its prey caught in the web has never before been documented as a fossil, the researcher said. The tree resin that forms amber is renowned for its ability to flow over insects, small plants and other life forms, preserving them in near perfection before it later turns into a semi precious stone. It often gives scientists a look into the biology of the distant past. This spider, which may have been waiting patiently for hours to capture some prey, was smothered in resin just a split second before its attack. This type of wasp, Prof Poinar said, belongs to a group that is known today to parasitize spider and insect eggs. In that context, the attack by the spider, an orb weaver, might be considered payback. Both the spider and the wasp belong to extinct genera. At least 15 unbroken strands of spider silk run through the amber piece, and on some of these the wasp was ensnared.

The newly discovered species, named Pegomastax africanus, or thick jaw from Africa, has a short parrot shaped beak up front, a pair of stabbing canines, and tall teeth tucked behind for slicing plants. The tall teeth in upper and lower jaws operated like self sharpening scissors, with shearing wear facets that slid past one another when the jaws closed. The parrot shaped skull, less than three inches long, may have been adapted to plucking fruit. Details of the dinosaurs anatomy and lifestyle are part of a monograph by Prof Paul Sereno of the University of Chicago dedicated to these puny herbivores and published in the online journal ZooKeys. Very rare, Prof Sereno said, that a plant eater like Pegomastax would sport sharp edged, enlarged canines like that of a vampire. Some scientists have argued that consuming meat or at the least insects was a good part of the diet of heterodontosaurs, which evolved near the root of the great bird hipped radiation of dinosaurs that includes the famous plant eaters Triceratops and Stegosaurus. Self defense and competitive sparring for mates is more likely their role, Prof Sereno said in the study, based on microscopic examination of the teeth of Pegomastax and kin. Wear facets and chipped enamel suggest that the fangs of Pegomastax and other heterodontosaurs were used like those of living fanged deer for nipping or even digging rather than slicing flesh. A bizarre covering of bristles, something like that of a porcupine, likely covered most of the body of Pegomastax, which measured less than two feet in length and weighed less than a housecat. These bristles first came to light in a similar sized heterodontosaur, Tianyulong, discovered recently in China and described in the study. Buried in lake sediment and covered by volcanic ash, Tianyulong preserves hundreds of bristles spread across its body from its neck to the tip of its tail. In life, dwarf sized heterodontosaurs like Pegomastax would have scampered around in search of suitable plants, looking something like a nimble two legged porcupine, Prof Sereno said. When Pegomastax lived some 200 million years ago, the supercontinent Pangaea had just begun to split into northern and southern landmasses. Heterodontosaurs appear to have divided similarly, Prof Sereno argued in the study, the northern species with simple triangular teeth like Tianyulong and the southern species with taller crowns like Pegomastax. Although virtually unknown to the public, Pegomastax and kin were the most advanced plant eaters of their day, Prof Sereno said.

This is a reconstruction of a 390 million year old multiplacophoran Jakob Vinther  University of Texas at Austin The fossil of this oval shaped sea creature was discovered about 10 years ago in Ohio by a private collector. Working with the delicate specimen partially covered by rock, the team used a micro CT scan  a noninvasive technology similar to medical CAT scanning  to create a 3D view of the fossil. The CT scan yielded an animated view of the original placement of the creatures dense spines and shells, which had splayed out and decayed prior to fossilization. The results appear in a paper published online in the journal Palaeontology. The CT scan also produced a 3D cast of the specimen in its reconstructed shape. Working with the cast, the animation and information on living relatives of the multiplacophorans, the team was able to create a multicolored, textured model in clay, resin and silicone showing how the creature looked millions of years ago, when it crawled on a single, suction like foot over shells and rocky surfaces in ancient oceans. The model helps address a debate about how multiplacophorans relate to chitons, another more widely known plated mollusk that lives on seashores and is commonly eaten in the Caribbean. By dating the origin of modern chitons, the scientists could demonstrate that multiplacophorans are stem group chitons. We can now demonstrate that multiplacophorans are distant relatives of the modern chitons, which did not evolve until later in Earth history, said Dr Jakob Vinther, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Texas at Austins Jackson School of Geosciences and lead author on the study. We can also show that they evolved a number of characteristics seen in some modern chitons convergently. The CT scan was integral to the project, allowing the scientists to see below the surface of the fossil. CT scanning is an extremely powerful technique for paleontologists, since we can look inside fossils without destroying them, Dr Vinther concluded. "}, {"title": " Study Provides Evidence for Widespread Land-Based Microbial Life in Late Archean Era", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "Sep 25, 2012", "doc": "Scientists at the University of Washington suggest that early microbes might have been widespread on land, producing oxygen and weathering pyrite, an iron sulfide mineral, which released sulfur and molybdenum into the oceans. A drill core from the 2.5 billion year old Mount McRae Shale formation in Western Australia, which originally was fine grained ocean sediment, shows high concentrations of sulfide and molybdenum Roger Buick  University of Washington There is evidence that some microbial life had migrated from the Earths oceans to land by 2.75 billion years ago, though many scientists believe such land based life was limited because the ozone layer that shields against ultraviolet radiation did not form until hundreds of millions years later. But a new study challenges these beliefs. This shows that life didnt just exist in a few little places on land. It was important on a global scale because it was enhancing the flow of sulfate from land into the ocean, said Eva St\u00fceken, a doctoral student in Earth and space sciences with the University of Washington and lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Geoscience. In turn, the influx of sulfur probably enhanced the spread of life in the oceans. Sulfur could have been released into sea water by other processes, including volcanic activity. But evidence that molybdenum was being released at the same time suggests that both substances were being liberated as bacteria slowly disintegrated continental rocks, she said. If that is the case, it likely means the land based microbes were producing oxygen well in advance of what geologists refer to as the Great Oxidation Event about 2.4 billion years ago that initiated the oxygen rich atmosphere that fostered life as we know it. In fact, the added sulfur might have allowed marine microbes to consume methane, which could have set the stage for atmospheric oxygenation. Before that occurred, it is likely large amounts of oxygen were destroyed by reacting with methane that rose from the ocean into the air. It supports the theory that oxygen was being produced for several hundred million years before the Great Oxidation Event. It just took time for it to reach higher concentrations in the atmosphere, St\u00fceken said. The research examined data on sulfur levels in 1,194 samples from marine sediment formations dating from before the Cambrian period began about 542 million years ago. The processes by which sulfur can be added or removed are understood well enough to detect biological contributions. The data came from numerous research projects during the last several decades, but in most cases those observations were just a small part of much larger studies. In an effort to provide consistent interpretation, St\u00fceken combed the research record for data that came from similar types of sedimentary rock and similar environments. The data has been out there for a long time, but people have ignored it because it is hard to interpret when it is not part of a large database, St\u00fceken said.

An artists reconstruction of Aviturus exsecratus Vasilyan D Giant salamanders are amazing animals. They can live up to 100 years, grow up to 2 m in length, and have inhabited the Earth for more than 56 million years. The fossils of these amphibians, found relatively often in Eurasia, show little variation from their modern descendants. Early giant salamanders had a similar lifestyle and were just as big as todays, which live in East Asia and North America. But while the latter stick to oxygen rich, fast flowing mountain streams in China, Japan and the US, their ancestors also lived in rivers and lakes in the lowlands. The researchers at the University of T\u00fcbingen re examined fossils of Aviturus exsecratus, which lived some 56 million years ago in what is now southern Mongolia. They were able to demonstrate that this salamander hunted for food both in the water and on land that makes it different from all the later giant salamanders. The development of a species from a purely aquatic lifestyle to an amphibious terrestrial lifestyle is linked with gigantism and sustained growth, and is called peramorphosis. It is completely unknown in modern salamanders. Individual development like that was only seen in paleozoological amphibians such as eryops, which lived 300 million years ago. By analyzing the shape of Aviturus lower jaw, the scientists have found that the salamander fed on fish and invertebrates in the water. At the same time, Aviturus probably hunted insects. Terrestrial adaptation is indicated by the animals heavy bones, long hind legs, a well developed sense of smell, and palatal dentition typical of a terrestrial salamander. Also, fossil remains of this huge, up to 2m long animal were found in rock typically formed from waters edge sediments. The findings were published in a paper in the recent issue of the journal PloS ONE. The researchers suggest this drastic individual development in Aviturus exsecratus was probably due to a short period of global warming 55.8 million years ago known as the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum.

Photograph and interpretive drawing of the footprints adapted from Matt Stimson et al  Ichnos A fossil specimen of the ichnogenus Batrachichnus salamandroides was collected by local amateur paleontologist Gloria Melanson, daughter of Don Reid, the famed Keeper of the Joggins Cliffs, while walking the Joggins beach. This was one of the most exciting finds I have ever made and I am very pleased that, along with my colleagues, we are able to share it with the world. Every big fossil find is by chance its all about being lucky and recognizing what youre looking at. When I saw the very small tail and toes I knew we had something special. I never thought it would be the worlds smallest, Melanson said. The footprints, described in a paper in the journal Ichnos, belong to a small amphibian which would have roamed the Earth 315 million years ago, a creature not unlike a salamander. The fossil record at Joggins is most famous for its diverse skeletal record of small tetrapods, dominated by an array of small, primitive amphibians, and the oldest known reptile, Hylonomus lyelli, entombed within once hollow fossil tree stumps. Small trackways of these animals at the site are common, but none so small as the one discovered recently. The 48 mm long trackway preserves approximately 30 footprints with the front feet measuring 1.6 mm long and back feet measuring 2.4 mm long. Professional paleontologists have confirmed that the trace maker was a juvenile amphibian, similar to a salamander with an estimated body length of only 8 mm from snout to tail. Further examination shows the animal began in a walk and later changed direction as it began to run. Speculation could be made that these are some of the juveniles first footsteps on land after transforming from a tadpole stage that hatched in a local pond. The change in direction and speed may be interpreted as the animal either becoming startled by a larger predator, or perhaps while hunting some small insects, itself.

Triassic arthropods found in amber from northeastern Italy a nematoceran fly, left, and two species of mites Triasacarus fedelei, center, and Ampezzoa triassica Schmidt et al  Museum of Geology and Paleontology  University of Padova An international team of paleontologists reports the newly discovered fly and two disparate species of mites, Triasacarus fedelei, and Ampezzoa triassica, in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Amber is an extremely valuable tool for paleontologists because it preserves specimens with microscopic fidelity, allowing uniquely accurate estimates of the amount of evolutionary change over millions of years, said co author Dr David Grimaldi, a curator in the American Museum of Natural Historys Division of Invertebrate Zoology. Amber ranges in age from the Carboniferous about 340 million years ago to about 40,000 years ago, and has been produced by myriad plants, from tree ferns to flowering trees, but predominantly by conifers. Even though arthropods are more than 400 million years old, until now, the oldest record of the animals in amber dates to about 130 million years. The arthropods break that mold with an age of 230 million years. They are the first arthropods to be found in amber from the Triassic period. Two new species of mites are the oldest fossils in an extremely specialized group called Eriophyoidea that has about 3,500 living species, all of which feed on plants and sometimes form abnormal growth called galls. The ancient gall mites are surprisingly similar to ones seen today. You would think that by going back to the Triassic youd find a transitional form of gall mite, but no, Dr Grimaldi said. Even 230 million years ago, all of the distinguishing features of this family were there  a long, segmented body only two pairs of legs instead of the usual four found in mites unique feather claws, and mouthparts. The ancient mites likely fed on the leaves of the tree that ultimately preserved them, a conifer in the extinct family Cheirolepidiaceae. Although about 97 percent of todays gall mites feed on flowering plants, Triasacarus fedelei and Ampezzoa triassica existed prior to the appearance and rapid radiation of flowering plants. This finding reveals the evolutionary endurance of the mites. We now know that gall mites are very adaptable, Dr Grimaldi said. When flowering plants entered the scene, these mites shifted their feeding habits, and today, only 3 percent of the species live on conifers. This shows how gall mites tracked plants in time and evolved with their hosts. The third amber specimen, a fly, cannot be identified because, outside of the insects antennae, its body parts were not well preserved. But now that the researchers have shown that amber preserved Triassic arthropods, they are eager to find more specimens. There was a huge change in the flora and fauna in the Triassic because it was right after one of the most profound mass extinctions in history, at the end of the Permian, Dr Grimaldi said. Its an important time to study if you want to know how life evolved.

Artists reconstruction of Wiwaxia Nobu Tamura  Spinops.blogspot.com  CC BY SA 3.0 The radula sounds like something from a horror movie  a conveyor belt lined with hundreds of rows of interlocking teeth. In fact, radulas are found in the mouths of most mollusks, from the giant squid to the garden snail. Smith has found that a prototype radula of 500 million year old fossils was not a flesh rasping terror, but a tool for humbly scooping food from the muddy sea floor. The Cambrian animals Odontogriphus and Wiwaxia might not have been much to look at  the former a naked slug, the latter a creeping bottom dweller covered with spines and scales. Despite the hundreds of fossil specimens collected from the Canadian Rockies by the Royal Ontario Museum, scientists could not agree whether they represented early mollusks, relatives of the earthworm, or an evolutionary dead end. Smith, author of a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, employed a new, non destructive type of electron microscopy to reveal the new details. I put the fossils in the microscope, and the mouth parts just leaped out, Smith said. You could see details youd never guess were there if you just had a normal microscope. After examining some 300 fossils, Smith was able not just to reconstruct the mouthparts, but work out how they grew. The fossils are squashed completely flat, which makes them really hard to reconstruct in 3D, Smith explained.

By establishing how the teeth were arranged, moved, grew, and were replaced, Smith was able to demonstrate that they formed a shorter and squatter forerunner to the modern radula. When I set out, I just hoped to be a bit closer to knowing what these mysterious fossils were, Smith said. Now, with this picture of the earliest radula, we are one step closer to understanding where the mollusks came from and how they became so successful today.

Life restoration of Ichthyosaurus communis Nobu Tamura  Spinops.blogspot.com Earlier this year Dr Bruce Rothschild of the University of Kansas announced the discovery of bone deformities on the fossilized remains of ichthyosaurs. The lesions are similar to those human divers develop as a result of changes in body pressure, and suggest the reptiles suffered from a version of the bends. Prof Haymans study, published in the journal Naturwissenschaften, explains what may have caused these bone lesions. The research argues the scarring may be the result of deep diving and spending too long at depth, causing excess nitrogen to be dissolved in the body, and not from quick ascents as previously thought. Ichthyosaurs probably evolved the ability to dive deeper and to remain at depth for longer periods, Prof Hayman said. An alternative explanation is that the reptiles developed decompression sickness from being trapped in shallow water by predators. It wasnt from sudden and rapid ascents, he added. Prof Hayman said the dangerous practice of deep sea diving wouldnt have affected the reptiles long term survival because any ill effects would have developed later in life. The lesions wouldnt have been enough to kill the animal, and wouldnt have affected its ability to hunt or breed. Prof Hayman said the new analysis was possible because structure of modern humans necks is very similar to the prehistoric reptiles. The arterial blood supply to the humerus and other bones such as the neck of the femur is highly conserved. It has remained much the same for 250 million years, the scientist concluded.

The interparietal and tabular bones in different mammals. The interparietal tabular complex is marked in light green Koyabu et al  University of Zurich The mammalian skull, including that of humans, is composed of about 20 bones. Fish, reptile and bird skulls, however, have considerably more. When mammals evolved 320 million years ago, the skulls structure became simplified during its development and the number of skull bones decreased. Some bones were lost in the lineage leading to mammals in the course of evolution, especially a number of skull roof bones. The interparietal bone, also referred to as os interparietale, is a median triangular bone lying at the junction of the parietal and occipital bones of the mammalian skull. The bone has particularly puzzled researchers on the one hand, it seems to have survived in carnivores, ungulates and humans it is frequently found in contemporary indigenous peoples of the southern Andes as well as in those of mummies of the Inca civilization as a separate bone in the skull on the other hand, it is not found in all mammals. By studying fossils and embryos of over 300 species of vertebrates, the researchers have now been able to identify the bone in all of them. They used non invasive micro CT imaging to analyze rare embryos of different species from museum collections. The interparietal was clearly discernible in specimens from the embryonic period as the skull bones were fused less strongly here, said Marcelo S\u00e1nchez, a professor of paleontology at the University of Zurich and co author of the paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. At the same time, he sees the fact that the bone is only clearly and easily discernible in the embryonic period as the reason why previous researchers failed to recognize it It would seem that many anatomists have overlooked the presence of the interparietal in numerous mammalian lineages as the bone becomes fused to other skull bones during growth and is unrecognizable in adult individuals. Another result that also refutes previous assumptions concerns the origin of the bone. Whilst it was previously assumed that the mammalian interparietal was composed of two elements, we discovered that it develops from four elements a medial and a lateral pair, explained lead author Dr Daisuke Koyabu, a post doctoral student at the University of Zurich. The tabular bones of our ancestors and fish correspond to the lateral interparietal bones, which were overlooked until now. According to the new results, however, they have survived in mammalian lineages after all. The evidence of the continuation of fish bones in mammals provides new insights into the origins of our own anatomy, Prof S\u00e1nchez concluded.

Two New Zealand moa and Giant Haasts eagle John Megahan  PLoS Biology Their research, published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, reveals that the population size of the giant moa remained stable over the past 40,000 years until the arrival of humans in New Zealand around 1280 CE. The giant birds  measuring up to 2.5 meters high and weighing 250 kilograms  were the largest herbivores in New Zealands pre human environment but were quickly exterminated after the arrival of Polynesian settlers. Until now it has been difficult to determine how megafauna responded to environmental change over the past 50,000 years, because human arrival and climate change occurred simultaneously in many parts of the world, said Dr Nic Rawlence, lead author of the study and a postdoctoral research fellow from the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA and the University of Waikato. Using ancient DNA, radiocarbon dating and stable dietary isotope analysis, we have been able to show that before humans arrived, moa mitigated the effects of climate change by tracking their preferred habitat as it expanded, contracted and shifted during warming and cooling events, Dr Rawlence said. Moa were not in serious decline before humans arrived, as has been previously suggested, but had relatively stable population sizes. The overwhelming evidence suggests that the extinction of moa occurred due to overhunting and habitat destruction, at a time of relative climatic stability. The results show that range shifts and minor population fluctuations observable in the fossil and genetic record are a natural response to environmental change and do not necessarily lead to extinction, said co author Dr Jamie Wood of Landcare Research. Climate change has been blamed for megafaunal extinctions in other parts of the world, but this is not the case for moa, added co author Dr Jessica Metcalf of the University of Colorado. The very recent extinctions in New Zealand provide a unique opportunity to examine the extinction of Ice Age megafauna and the relative roles of human hunting and climate change, said Prof Alan Cooper of the University of Adelaides Australian Centre for Ancient DNA.

An iceberg floating near the Antarctic coast Roy Davis  Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Given the predicted rise in global temperatures in the coming decades, climate scientists are particularly interested in warm periods that occurred in the geological past. Knowledge of past episodes of global warmth can be used to better understand the relationship between climate change, variations in atmospheric carbon dioxide and the reaction of Earths biosphere. The study, published in the journal Nature, shows that tropical vegetation, including palms and relatives of todays tropical Baobab trees, was growing on the coast of Antarctica 52 million years ago. These results highlight the extreme contrast between modern and past climatic conditions on Antarctica and the extent of global warmth during periods of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Around 52 million years ago, the concentration of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was more than twice as high as today. If the current carbon dioxide emissions continue unabated due to the burning of fossil fuels, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, as they existed in the distant past, are likely to be achieved within a few hundred years, said lead author Prof J\u00f6rg Pross, a paleoclimatologist at the Goethe University. By studying naturally occurring climate warming periods in the geological past, our knowledge of the mechanisms and processes in the climate system increases. This contributes enormously to improving our understanding of current human induced global warming, he added. 52 million year old palm pollen, left, and pollen from the ancestors of todays baobab trees, found by the team Lineth Contreras  Goethe University Frankfurt The scientists analyzed rock samples from drill cores on the seabed, which were obtained off the coast of Wilkes Land, Antarctica, as part of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. The rock samples are between 53 and 46 million years old and contain fossil pollen and spores that are known to originate from the Antarctic coastal region. The researchers were thus able to reconstruct the local vegetation on Antarctica and, accordingly, interpret the presence of tropical and subtropical rainforests covering the coastal region 52 million years ago. The scientists evaluations show that the winter temperatures on the Wilkes Land coast of Antarctica were warmer than 10 degrees Celsius at that time, despite three months of polar night. The continental interior, however, was noticeably cooler, with the climate supporting the growth of temperate rainforests characterized by southern beech and Araucaria trees of the type common in New Zealand today. Additional evidence of extremely mild temperatures was provided by analysis of organic compounds that were produced by soil bacteria populating the soils along the Antarctic coast. The findings also imply that the temperature difference between the low latitudes and high southern latitudes during the greenhouse phase 52 million years ago was significantly smaller than previously thought.

Dwarf horses, the primate Ida and jewel beetles  the spectacular discoveries from the Messel pit near Darmstadt are known worldwide. However, the plant fossils from there are also unique. A team of paleobotanists, including scientists from the Senckenberg Research Institute SRI in Frankfurt, the University of London and the Florida Museum of Natural History, described at least 140 genera of fossil plants. The seeds and fruits, as well as many leaves, flowers and pollen grains were recovered during excavations in the previous decades but they had not been studied in detail before. We have found numerous remains of a diversity of flowering plants and some conifers, explained Dr Volker Wilde, Head of the paleobotany section at the SRI and senior author of the monograph. More than 60 types of plants could not be assigned to any known family  they are genuine new discoveries. A fossil fruit of the moonseed family from the Middle Eocene of the Messel site Collinson et al  \u00a9 Senckenberg Ten of the described families of flowering plants were previously unknown at the Messel pit, three genera were even described for the first time for the Eocene. We are impressed not only by the large number of different plant families but also by the variety of dispersal strategies they had developed even at that time, Dr Wilde said. Some developed wings on their seeds and relied on wind, some depended on animals to spread them, while others developed exploding capsules to scatter their seeds over a wide area. From the flora described we are also able to draw conclusions about the diet of animals 47 million years ago, the paleobotanist said. Fruits and seeds in the digestive tracts of vertebrates indicate that they were an important part of their food. Tiny holes in seeds also show that the famous Messel weevils also fed on certain plants. The flora is also ideal for reconstructing climatic and environmental conditions of the Eocene. Having analyzed around 30,000 plant remains, the team suggests that there was a warm tropical climate with seasonal variations. We believe the Messel pit was surrounded by a more or less tropical multi storey rainforest, similar to those in areas with a comparable climate today. We also identified a high proportion of lianas and several marsh plants  virtually on our doorstep, it was a real jungle out there at the Messel 47 million years ago, Dr Wilde said.

An image shows the fossilized jaw of the oldest chinchillid rodent, Eoviscaccia frassinettii, which is related to the modern chinchilla M. Ellison  AMNH The two new species lived near a chain of volcanoes about 32.5 million years ago in what are now the steep slopes of a river valley in the Chilean Andes. Studies of the teeth of the ancient chinchilla support evidence from other species in the concurrent fauna indicating that the animals inhabited an open and dry environment 15 million years before grasslands emerged elsewhere in the world. The new chinchilla fossil provides important new evidence that early rodents joined other South American mammals in evolving ways to cope with an abrasive diet long before horses, sheep and other mammal groups on other continents invented similar adaptations for making their teeth wear out more slowly while eating tough grasses, said Dr John Flynn, Frick Curator of Fossil Mammals and dean of the Richard Gilder Graduate School at the American Museum of Natural History, who is a co author of a paper published in the journal American Museum Novitates. The team has explored the fossil history preserved in the Chilean Andes for the past 25 years. In the Tinguiririca River valley, an area near the border of Chile and Argentina once thought to be inhospitable to fossils because of the dominance of volcanic rocks, the researchers have uncovered hundreds of specimens, including the two newly named species of early South American rodents. The new specimens  Andemys termasi, for which the genus name means mouse of the Andes and the species name refers to the nearby town of Termas del Flaco, and Eoviscaccia frassinettii, named for the late Daniel Frassinetti, who was a longtime collaborator and head of paleontology at Chiles National Museum of Natural Historyare the second oldest rodents ever discovered in South America. The oldest are recently discovered 41 million year old rodents from Peru. The new species are distinguished from the older rodents by many features of their teeth. The Tinguiririca chinchilla replicates a dental pattern appearing in many other South American herbivores such as Notoungulates  hooved animals that are now extinct  at that time. This pattern is called hypsodonty, said lead author Dr Ornella Bertrand. Hypsodonty, the quality of having high crowned teeth, is a trait that emerged in multiple kinds of animals, such as horses, goats, and cows. Hypsodonty is generally interpreted as an adaption that arose in response to the spread of grassy environments. The age of the fossils and the high crowned teeth of the new chinchilla and many other mammals in the same fauna suggest to researchers that the mountainous Tinguiririca River valley was a grassy plain at the time the debris from a volcanic eruption buried them. This means that the Chilean Andes supported plains environments some 15 million years before such ecosystems are known on other continents. In addition to being preserved in unusual volcanically derived sediments, the new rodent species are notable for coming from what is assuredly one of the most spectacularly scenic and rugged sequences of fossil mammal localities in the world, said co author Dr Andr\u00e9 Wyss of the University of California in Santa Barbara.

Two Diplodocus longus Dmitry Bogdanov In the study, published today in the journal Naturwissenschaften, the group finds that Diplodocus  one of the largest dinosaurs ever discovered  had a skull adapted to strip leaves from tree branches. The Diplodocus is a sauropod from the Jurassic Period and one of the longest animals to have lived on Earth, measuring over 30 m in length and weighing around 15 tones. While known to be massive herbivores, there has been great debate about exactly how they ate such large quantities of plants. The aberrant Diplodocus, with its long snout and protruding peg like teeth restricted to the very front of its mouth, has been the center of such controversy. To solve the mystery, the researchers using data from a CT scan created a 3D model of a complete Diplodocus skull. This model was then biomechanically analyzed to test three feeding behaviors using finite element analysis FEA. FEA is widely used, from designing airplanes to orthopedic implants. It revealed the various stresses and strains acting on the Diplodocus skull during feeding to determine whether the skull or teeth would break under certain conditions. Sauropod dinosaurs, like Diplodocus, were so weird and different from living animals that there is no animal we can compare them with. This makes understanding their feeding ecology very difficult, explained lead author Dr Mark Young of the University of Bristol and the Natural History Museum in London. Thats why biomechanically modeling is so important to our understanding of long extinct animals. A model of the Diplodocus skull showing the distribution of stresses during biting Young MT et al Using these techniques, borrowed from the worlds of engineering and medicine, we can start to examine the feeding behavior of this long extinct animal in levels of detail which were simply impossible until recently, said co author Dr Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum. Numerous hypotheses of feeding behavior have been suggested for Diplodocus since its discovery over 130 years ago. These ranged from standard biting, combing leaves through peg like teeth, ripping bark from trees similar to behavior in some living deer, and even plucking shellfish from rocks. The team found that whilst bark stripping was perhaps unsurprisingly too stressful for the teeth, combing and raking of leaves from branches was overall no more stressful to the skull bones and teeth than standard biting.

Skeleton of Sciurumimus on a limestone slab \u00a9 H. Tischlinger  Jura Museum Eichst\u00e4tt The fossil of Sciurumimus albersdoerferi, which lived about 150 million years ago, provides the first evidence of feathered theropod dinosaurs that are not closely related to birds. This is a surprising find from the cradle of feathered dinosaur work, the very formation where the first feathered dinosaur Archaeopteryx was collected over 150 years ago, said Dr Mark Norell, chair of the Division of Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History and senior author of a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Theropods are bipedal, mostly carnivorous dinosaurs. In recent years, scientists have discovered that many extinct theropods had feathers. But this feathering has only been found in theropods that are classified as coelurosaurs, a diverse group including animals like T. rex and birds. Sciurumimus  identified as a megalosaur, not a coelurosaur is the first exception to this rule. The new species also sits deep within the evolutionary tree of theropods, much more so than coelurosaurs, meaning that the species that stem from Sciurumimus are likely to have similar characteristics. All of the feathered predatory dinosaurs known so far represent close relatives of birds, said lead author Dr Oliver Rauhut, a paleontologist at the Bayerische Staatssammlung f\u00fcr Pal\u00e4ontologie und Geologie. Sciurumimus is much more basal within the dinosaur family tree and thus indicates that all predatory dinosaurs had feathers. The fossil, which is of a baby Sciurumimus, was found in the limestones of northern Bavaria and preserves remains of a filamentous plumage, indicating that the whole body was covered with feathers. The genus name of Sciurumimus albersdoerferi refers to the scientific name of the tree squirrels, Sciurus, and means squirrel mimic referring to the especially bushy tail of the animal. The species name honors the private collector who made the specimen available for scientific study. Under ultraviolet light, remains of the skin and feathers show up as luminous patches around the skeleton, said co author Dr Helmut Tischlinger of the Jura Museum Eichstatt. Mid tail section of Sciurumimus under ultraviolet light, showing patches of preserved skin, yellow, and fine filaments, bluish lines above the vertebrae \u00a9 H. Tischlinger  Jura Museum Eichst\u00e4tt Sciurumimus is not only remarkable for its feathers. The skeleton, which represents the most complete predatory dinosaur ever found in Europe, allows a rare glimpse at a young dinosaur. Apart from other known juvenile features, such as large eyes, the new find also confirmed other hypotheses. It has been suggested for some time that the lifestyle of predatory dinosaurs changed considerably during their growth, Dr Rauhut said. Sciurumimus shows a remarkable difference to adult megalosaurs in the dentition, which clearly indicates that it had a different diet. Everything we find these days shows just how deep in the family tree many characteristics of modern birds go, and just how bird like these animals were, Dr Norell said. At this point it will surprise no one if feather like structures were present in the ancestors of all dinosaurs.

Image shows tracks of the earliest animal life form ever discovered. Bilaterians, centimetre long slug like animals, left their mark 585 million years ago in shallow water silt in what is now Uruguay. The find predates all previous evidence of first animal life on Earth by 30 million years Richard Siemens The researchers discovered fossilized tracks of a centimeter long, slug like animal left behind 585 million years ago in a silty sediment. They determined that the tracks were made by a primitive animal called a bilaterian, which is distinguished from other non animal, simple life forms by its symmetry its topside is distinguishable from its bottom side and a unique set of footprints. The team suggests the fossilized tracks indicate the soft bodied animals musculature enabled it to move through the sediment on the shallow ocean floor. The pattern of movement indicates an evolutionary adaptation to search for food, which would have been organic material in the sediment. The precise age of the tracks was calculated by dating the age of an igneous rock that intruded into the siltstone in the area where the tracks were found. It took more than two years for the researchers to satisfy themselves and a panel of peer review scientists that the age of 585 million years is accurate. The dating process included a trip back to Uruguay to collect more samples of the fossilized rock and multiple sessions of mass spectrometry analysis. When it comes to soft bodied animals and their tracks its not unusual for the animals body to disappear but its tracks become fossilized, said Dr Murray Gingras, a paleontologist at the University of Alberta and senior author of a paper published in the journal Science. Prior to the discovery and age confirmation, the oldest sign of animal life was dated at 555 million years ago from a find made in Russia.

The study provides the first detailed description of a primitive flatfish, revealing that the migrated eye had not yet crossed to the opposite side of the skull in early members of this group. Heteronectes, with its flattened form, shows the perfect intermediate stage between most fish with eyes on each side of the head and specialized flatfishes where both eyes are on the same side. This fossil comes from Bolca in northern Italy, a site that has literally been mined for hundreds of years for its fossil fishes, Dr Friedman said. This remarkable site provides a snapshot of an early coral reef assemblage.

In 1984 and 1994 during routine explorations a speleological group found the bone remains of two male and one female Ibex in the karstic caves and wells that acted like traps in Larra and Millaris, Spain. Both locations lie at 2,390 and 2,500 m height, respectively. Dr Ricardo Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez, a researcher at the Pyrenean Institute of Ecology has been put in charge of analyzing the skulls and comparing their craniometric characteristics with both fossil and modern day neighboring mountain goat populations.  Published in the journal Comptes Rendus Palevol, the results suggest that these wild goats were about 50 bigger than modern Ibex that lived in the Iberian Peninsula until it became extinct in 2000. The skulls of the males where extraordinarily big in comparison with the other goat remains of the late Pleistocene Age between 120,000 and 11,000 years ago on South West Europe, Dr Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez said to SINC. According to the author, the increase in size could be due to the increased availability of trophic resources during the Holocene Age. This would fit in with the widespread theory on ungulate evolution put forward by the scientist V. Geist in 1987, which makes reference to the giants of the Ice Age. Some of these giants, such as the Megaceros deer, had large display organs which served to dissuade competitors and reduce the number of fights in an age when species were finding new opportunities and more food around the edges of glaciers. The males with large horns were more successful in terms of reproduction as a result, Dr Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez said. The females invested their energy into the survival of their offspring and so had no need to have bigger display organs. Along with their size, the high altitude at which the remains were found is unusual. The explanation lies in the fact that some 7,000 years ago the ice had begun to melt in Millaris an altitude of 2,500 m, where the remains of the last Pyrenees glaciers are still present. Nutritious alpine pastures had already begun to develop up beyond the forest edges. The Ibex would take advantage of this in the summer with their seasonal migration, just like their modern counterparts. As for the origin of the subspecies, the analysis of this wild Pyrenees goats fossil skull falls in line with the molecular genetics studies and suggests an even greater similarity with the Alpine Ibex, C. ibex. However, until now the scientific community thought that the Iberian mountain goat came from a common ancestor that it shared with the West Caucasian tur, C. caucasica, that migrated towards the Central Massif of France around 80,000 years ago. More findings and further fossil studies are required to confirm the origin and differences of this subspecies, Dr Garc\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez concluded.

The fossilized braincase of Acanthodes bronni and artists impression of the ancient fish Michael Coates  Nobu Tamura The new study, published in Nature, sheds light on the evolution of the earliest jawed vertebrates and offers a new glimpse of the last common ancestor before the split between the earliest sharks and the first bony fishes  the lineage that would eventually include human beings. Unexpectedly, Acanthodes turns out to be the best view we have of conditions in the last common ancestor of bony fishes and sharks, said senior author Michael Coates, a professor of organismal biology and anatomy at the University of Chicago. Our work is telling us that the earliest bony fishes looked pretty much like sharks, and not vice versa. What we might think of as shark space is, in fact, general modern jawed vertebrate space. The group gnathostomes, meaning jaw mouths, includes tens of thousands of living vertebrate species, ranging from fish and sharks to birds, reptiles, mammals and humans. Cartilaginous fish, which today include sharks, rays, and ratfish, diverged from the bony fishes more than 420 million years ago. But little is known about what the last common ancestor of humans, manta rays and great white sharks looked like. Prof Coates and his colleagues found answers to this mystery in an unexpected place the acanthodians, extinct fishes that generally left behind only tiny scales and elaborate suites of fin spines. But armed with new data on what the earliest sharks and bony fishes looked like, the team re examined fossils of Acanthodes bronni, the best preserved acanthodian species. Study lead author Dr Davis created highly detailed latex molds of specimens revealing the inside and outside of the skull, providing a valuable new data set for assessing cranial and jaw anatomy as well as the organizations of sensory, circulatory and respiratory systems in the species. We want to explore braincases if possible, because they are exceptionally rich sources of anatomical information, Prof Coates said. Theyre much better than scales, teeth or fin spines, which, on their own, tend to deliver a confusing signal of evolutionary relationships. The analysis of the sample combined with recent CT scans of skulls from early sharks and bony fishes led the team to a surprising reassessment of what Acanthodes bronni tells us about the history of jawed vertebrates. For the first time, we could look inside the head of Acanthodes, and describe it within this whole new context, Prof Coates said. The more we looked at it, the more similarities we found with sharks. However, analysis of the evolutionary relationships of Acanthodes bronni  even with these new data added  still connected this species to early bony fishes. Meanwhile, some acanthodian species turned out to be primitive sharks, while others were relatives of the common ancestor of sharks and bony fishes. This result explains some of the longstanding confusion about the placement of acanthodians in vertebrate history. But additional analyses went a step further. Using more than 100 morphological characters, the researchers quantified the mutual resemblance among the earliest jawed fishes. Acanthodians as a whole, including the earliest members of humans own deep evolutionary past, appear to cluster with ancient sharks.

This fossil wing of Stephanotypus schneideri from the period about 300 million years ago when insects reached their greatest sizes, measures 19.5 cm 8 inches long. The largest species of that time were even bigger, with wings 30 cm long. For comparison, the inset shows the wing of the largest dragonfly of the past 65 million years Wolfgang Zessin Giant insects ruled the prehistoric skies during periods when Earths atmosphere was rich in oxygen. They reached their biggest sizes about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous and early Permian periods. This was the reign of the predatory griffinflies, giant dragonfly like insects with wingspans of up to 28 inches 70 cm. The leading theory attributes their large size to high oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere  over 30 percent compared to 21 percent today  which allowed giant insects to get enough oxygen through the tiny breathing tubes that insects use instead of lungs. The scientists compiled a huge dataset of wing lengths from published records of fossil insects, then analyzed insect size in relation to oxygen levels over hundreds of millions of years of insect evolution. Their findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Maximum insect size does track oxygen surprisingly well as it goes up and down for about 200 million years, said lead author Dr Matthew Clapham, an assistant professor of Earth and planetary sciences at the University of California. Then right around the end of the Jurassic and beginning of the Cretaceous period, about 150 million years ago, all of a sudden oxygen goes up but insect size goes down. And this coincides really strikingly with the evolution of birds. With predatory birds on the wing, the need for maneuverability became a driving force in the evolution of flying insects, favoring smaller body size. The results are based on a fairly straightforward analysis, Dr Clapham said, But getting the data was a laborious task. Graduate student Jered Karr compiled the dataset of more than 10,500 fossil insect wing lengths from an extensive review of publications on fossil insects. For atmospheric oxygen concentrations over time, the researchers relied on the widely used Geocarbsulf model developed by Yale geologist Robert Berner. They also repeated the analysis using a different model and got similar results. The study provided weak support for an effect on insect size from pterosaurs, the flying reptiles that evolved in the late Triassic about 230 million years ago. There were larger insects in the Triassic than in the Jurassic, after pterosaurs appeared. But a 20 million year gap in the insect fossil record makes it hard to tell when insect size changed, and a drop in oxygen levels around the same time further complicates the analysis. Another transition in insect size occurred more recently at the end of the Cretaceous period, between 90 and 65 million years ago. Again, a shortage of fossils makes it hard to track the decrease in insect sizes during this period, and several factors could be responsible. These include the continued specialization of birds, the evolution of bats, and a mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. I suspect its from the continuing specialization of birds, Dr Clapham said. The early birds were not very good at flying. But by the end of the Cretaceous, birds did look quite a lot like modern birds. Dr Clapham emphasized that the study focused on changes in the maximum size of insects over time. Average insect size would be much more difficult to determine due to biases in the fossil record, since larger insects are more likely to be preserved and discovered.

Scan of the Berlin Brachiosaur WI Sellers University of Manchester biologists used lasers to measure the minimum amount of skin required to wrap around the skeletons of modern day mammals, including reindeer, polar bears, giraffes and elephants. They discovered that the animals had almost exactly 21 more body mass than the minimum skeletal skin and bone wrap volume, and applied this to a giant Brachiosaur skeleton in Berlins Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde. Previous estimates of this Brachiosaurs weight have varied, with estimates as high as 80 tones, but the teams calculations  reported in the journal Biology Letters  reduced that figure to just 23 tones. The team suggests the new technique will apply to all dinosaur weight measurements. One of the most important things paleobiologists need to know about fossilized animals is how much they weighed, said lead author Dr Bill Sellers. This is surprisingly difficult, so we have been testing a new approach. We laser scanned various large mammal skeletons, including polar bear, giraffe and elephant, and calculated the minimum wrapping volume of the main skeletal sections. We showed that the actual volume is reliably 21 more than this value, so we then laser scanned the Berlin Brachiosaur, Giraffatitan brancai, calculating the skin and bone wrapping volume and added 21. We found that the giant herbivore weighed 23 tones, supporting the view that these animals were much lighter than traditionally thought. Dr Sellers explained that body mass was a critical parameter used to constrain biomechanical and physiological traits of organisms. Volumetric methods are becoming more common as techniques for estimating the body masses of fossil vertebrates but they are often accused of excessive subjective input when estimating the thickness of missing soft tissue, he added. Here, we demonstrate an alternative approach where a minimum convex hull is derived mathematically from the point cloud generated by laser scanning mounted skeletons. This has the advantage of requiring minimal user intervention and is therefore more objective and far quicker. We tested this method on 14 large bodied mammalian skeletons and demonstrated that it consistently underestimated body mass by 21. We suggest that this is a robust method of estimating body mass where a mounted skeletal reconstruction is available and demonstrate its usage to predict the body mass of one of the largest, relatively complete sauropod dinosaurs, Giraffatitan brancai, as 23,200 kg. The value we got for Giraffatitan is at the low range of previous estimates although it is still huge, some of the enormous estimates of the past  80 tones in 1962  are exaggerated. Our method provides a much more accurate measure and shows dinosaurs, while still huge, are not as big as previously thought.

In the new study, Roger Close of Monash University and his supervisor Dr Emily Rayfield from the University of Bristol have compared wishbones of 87 extant birds and 21 Mesozoic birds and non avian theropods. Artwork shows Velociraptor, one of the fossil species studied by the team Matt Martyniuk In the study, published in the journal PLoS ONE, they compare birds wishbones and hypothesize on possible flight adaptations in fossil birds from the Mesozoic Era 65 200 million years ago. The research was inspired by an earlier study of living birds that hinted at a link between wishbone shape and mode of flight, such as soaring, flapping or underwater flying, said lead author Roger Close, a PhD candidate at the Monash Universitys School of Geosciences. Spectacular fossils documenting the early evolutionary history of birds have been unearthed at an ever increasing rate in recent years. But to date relatively few studies have used this new evidence to broaden our understanding of the functional anatomy or biomechanics of early avian evolution, he added. Drawing upon the wealth of recent fossil finds and a large sample of living species, the researchers used statistical analyses to compare wishbone shapes of Mesozoic birds with modern birds. The wishbone is well suited to studying flight in extinct birds, as it is commonly preserved in the fossil record and its shape linked with flight style. In modern birds, the wishbone shows tremendous morphological variety, ranging from U  to V shapes of varying widths and curvatures, Close said. Similar shape diversity is seen in the Mesozoic species, including some morphologies unseen today, such as the boomerang shaped wishbones of the most primitive birds, which resemble those of their close non bird theropod dinosaur relatives. The team was able to confirm the major finding of a previous study that wishbone shape varies depending on the flight mode of the species. For the more primitive groups of Mesozoic birds results indicated that, in contrast to their more anatomically modern contemporaries, the functional role of the wishbone may have differed. While this may be interpreted as evidence that early birds flew differently to those alive today, it might equally well indicate that they had evolved different anatomical solutions to accomplish the same feats, Close explained. This is just one piece of the puzzle. A complete picture of the evolution of flight in early birds will only be gained through synthesizing findings from multiple lines of enquiry.

Reconstruction of the whole body of Ichthyostega Julia Molnar The study, published in Nature, examines limb mobility in the 360 million year old fossil tetrapod by reconstructing the first ever 3D computer model of its skeleton. It took almost three years of hard work on difficult fossil material, but we are finally able to see how the skeleton of Ichthyostega fits together and might have moved in three dimensions. This is very exciting, as it allows us to examine how ancient vertebrates made the monumental transition from swimming to walking, said lead author Dr Stephanie Pierce of the Royal Veterinary College. To test how the limbs of Ichthyostega moved, the team scanned dozens of fossil specimens and digitally separated the bones from surrounding rock. Each bone was then carefully put back together like a jigsaw puzzle in animation software and painstakingly manipulated to estimate each joints maximal range of motion. Our reconstruction demonstrates that the old idea, often seen in popular books and museum displays, of Ichthyostega looking and walking like a large salamander, with four sturdy legs, is incorrect, explained study co author Prof Jennifer Clack of the University of Cambridge. By comparing their data to five living animals salamander, crocodile, platypus, seal, and otter, the scientists found that the shoulder and hip joints in Ichthyostega were unusually restricted in their motions, meaning the animal could not have used a conventional walking step. In particular, the study uncovered that the limbs in Ichthyostega were incapable of rotating along their long axis  a limb motion critical to locomotion in living land animals. Study co author Prof John R Hutchinson from the Royal Veterinary College said remarkably, earlier fishes called tetrapodomorphs had the ability to rotate their fins, so it seems that just as vertebrates were experimenting with terrestrial movement, the limbs became confined to mainly back and forth and up and down motions. It wasnt until tetrapods became more competent on land that they recovered the ability to rotate their limbs around their long axis. According to the study, a limited capacity to rotate the limbs implies that some of the earliest land animals could not walk well on all four legs. In particular, manipulation of the 3D model demonstrates that land locomotion in Ichthyostega like animals would probably have involved synchronized motions of the front legs, with the hind legs barely being able to reach the ground and probably playing a more minor supportive role along with the tail. These early tetrapods probably moved in a similar way to living mudskipper fishes in which the front finslegs are used like crutches to haul the body up and forward, Dr Pierce said. As early tetrapods were still mostly aquatic, this type of movement may have helped to stabilize the body during their first tentative forays onto land. The next step for the scientists is to combine their models of limb motion with similar models of the rest of the skeleton as well as muscles, to make much more sophisticated biomechanical analyses of just how these animals did or did not move, and how well they were able to do it.

An ink sac from a 160 million year old giant cephalopod fossil contains the pigment melanin it is essentially identical to the melanin found in the ink sac of a modern day cuttlefish Keely Glass et al  University of Virginia The discovery, published online in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that the ink screen escape mechanism of cephalopods  cuttlefish, squid and octopuses  has not evolved since the Jurassic period, and that melanin could be preserved intact in the fossils of a range of organisms. Though the other organic components of the cephalopod we studied are long gone, weve discovered through a variety of research methods that the melanin has remained in a condition that could be studied in exquisite detail, said study co author John Simon, a chemistry professor and the executive vice president at the University of Virginia. The scientists investigated fossils using a combination of direct, high resolution chemical techniques to determine whether or not the melanin had been preserved. They then compared the chemical composition of the fossil melanin to the melanin in the ink of the modern cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis, common to the Mediterranean, North and Baltic seas. Its close enough that I would argue that the pigmentation in this class of animals has not evolved in 160 million years, Prof Simon explained. The whole machinery apparently has been locked in time and passed down through succeeding generations of cuttlefish. Its a very optimized system for this animal and has been optimized for a long time. Generally animal tissue, made up mostly of protein, degrades quickly. Over the course of millions of years all that is likely to be found from an animal is skeletal remains or an impression of the shape of the animal in surrounding rock. Scientists can learn much about an animal by its bones and impressions, but without organic matter they are left with many unanswered questions. But melanin is an exception. Though organic, it is highly resilient to degradation over the course of vast amounts of time.\nOut of all of the organic pigments in living systems, melanin has the highest odds of being found in the fossil record, Prof Simon said. That attribute also makes it a challenge to study. We had to use innovative methods from chemistry, biology and physics to isolate the melanin from the inorganic material. I think the strength of this paper is that it is not tied to a single method, Prof Simon noted. Any one technique would have brought some insights, but potentially more questions than insights. It was really the more holistic approach that fully characterized it and allowed us to actually do a real comparison between what existed during the Jurassic period and what exists now.Its also given us a handle on ways of identifying organic components in fossils that might have been missed using standard methods."}, {"title": " Three New Raptor Dinosaurs Discovered in Utah", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "May 21, 2012", "doc": "US paleontologists have uncovered fossils of three new raptor dinosaurs that roamed what is now eastern Utah about 130 million years ago. Artists reconstruction of Yurgovuchia doellingi Phil Senter et al  UGS Raptors, or Dromaeosauridae, are a diverse family of predatory dinosaurs with a plethora of species that have been discovered within the last two decades and a few that were known previously. They are remarkable for the presence of an enlarged, recurved claw on the second toe that may have functioned as a predatory weapon, a weapon for finding its place in the packs pecking order, a climbing aid, a digging tool, or a combination of functions. Several species from China are covered in birdlike feathers and closely related to birds thus dromaeosaurids are important in studies of the origin of avian flight. Body sizes in the family have a large range from about the size of a mockingbird four winged Microraptor to the largest size of a bear Utahraptor. A new study, published today in the journal PLoS ONE, describes three newly found dromaeosaurids from the Lower Cretaceous of Utah and sheds light on the evolution of the dromaeosaurid tail. One of the species was named Yurgovuchia doellingi\u00a0in honor of Helmut Doelling in recognition of his more than 50 years of geological research and geological mapping of Utah for the Utah Geological Survey UGS. The genus name is derived from the Ute word yurgovuch, meaning coyote, a predator of similar size to Y. doellingi that currently inhabits the same region. A partial vertebral column and a part of the pelvis of Y. doellingi was found in 2005 by UGS paleontologist Don DeBlieux in Doellings Bowl Bone Bed, an extensive and important dinosaur site that was first discovered as a result of Doelling providing taped together color photocopies of his then unpublished geological maps of the Arches National Park region to an unknown young paleontologist named Jim Kirkland in 1990. The second species is represented by a part of the pelvis and a possibly associated arm bone. The third species, found a few miles to the west at Andrews Site, consists of a tail skeleton that is unique among known Cedar Mountain dromaeosaurids. This tail is distinctive in the long extensions of bone off of each vertebrae stiffing the tail as a balancing organ.Although not providing enough information to permit the species to be properly defined, the fossil proves that there were more advanced dromaeosaurs like Velociraptor and Deinonychus living in the same habitats as the giant but more primitive Utahraptor."}, {"title": " Ancient Giant Turtle Discovered in Colombia", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "May 17, 2012", "doc": "Paleontologists have discovered fossilized remains of a 60 million year old South American giant turtle that lived in what is now Colombia. Reconstruction of Carbonemys cofrinii preying upon a small crocodylomorph Liz Bradford The giant creature was named Carbonemys cofrinii or coal turtle, because it was discovered in 2005 in a coal mine that was part of northern Colombias Cerrejon formation. It belongs to a group of side necked turtles known as pelomedusoides. The specimens skull measures 24 cm, its shell which was recovered nearby  and is believed to belong to the same species  measures some 172 cm about 5 feet 7 inches long. We had recovered smaller turtle specimens from the site, said Edwin Cadena, a doctoral student at North Carolina State University, who discovered the fossil. But after spending about four days working on uncovering the shell, I realized that this particular turtle was the biggest anyone had found in this area for this time period  and it gave us the first evidence of gigantism in freshwater turtles. Smaller relatives of C. cofrinii existed alongside dinosaurs. But the giant version appeared five million years after the dinosaurs vanished, during a period when giant varieties of many different reptiles  including Titanoboa cerrejonensis, the largest snake ever discovered  lived in this part of South America. The paleontologists believe that a combination of changes in the ecosystem, including fewer predators, a larger habitat area, plentiful food supply and climate changes, worked together to allow these giant species to survive. Carbonemys habitat would have resembled a much warmer modern day Orinoco or Amazon River delta. In addition to the turtles huge size, the fossil also shows that this particular turtle had massive, powerful jaws that would have enabled the omnivore to eat anything nearby  from mollusks to smaller turtles or even crocodiles. Thus far, only one specimen of this size has been recovered. Dr Dan Ksepka, NC State paleontologist and research associate at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, believes that this is because a turtle of this size would need a large territory in order to obtain enough food to survive.Its like having one big snapping turtle living in the middle of a lake, said Dr Ksepka, a co author of a paper in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology describing the find. That turtle survives because it has eaten all of the major competitors for resources. We found many bite marked shells at this site that show crocodilians preyed on side necked turtles.

One of the reasons for the success of small, theropod dinosaurs may be their warm blood. As close relatives of birds, they had feathery insulation which helped maintain high body temperatures, Dr Rich explained.

Such a disease has never been described before in fossilized Jurassic reptiles. Artists restoration of the pliosaur Pliosaurus Dmitry Bogdanov The scientists studied a giant specimen of the pliosaur Pliosaurus dating from the Upper Jurassic. The specimen was found in Westbury, UK, and has been kept since its discovery in the collections of the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. The 8 meter long pliosaur was a terrifying creature with a large, crocodile like head, a short neck, whale like body and four powerful flippers to propel it through water in pursuit of prey. With its huge jaws and 20 cm long teeth, it would have been capable of ripping most other marine reptiles or dinosaurs to pieces, but this particular individual was the unfortunate victim of an arthritis like disease. Dr Judyth Sassoon of the University of Bristol, a lead author of the paper in the journal Palaeontology, noticed that the specimen had the signs of a degenerative condition similar to human arthritis, that had eroded its left jaw joint, displacing the lower jaw to one side. This animal evidently lived with a crooked jaw for many years, because there are marks on the bone of the lower jaw where the teeth from the upper jaw impacted on the bone during feeding. Clearly the animal was still able to hunt in spite of its unfortunate condition. There are several signs on the skeleton to suggest that the animal could have been an old female who had developed the condition as part of the aging process. The pliosaurs large size, and the fused skull bones, suggest maturity. It is identified, very tentatively, as possibly female because its skull crest is quite low  presumed males had a higher crest. Dr Judyth Sassoon with the lower jaw of the Westbury pliosaur Simon Powell In the same way that aging humans develop arthritic hips, this old lady developed an arthritic jaw, and survived with her disability for some time, Dr Sassoon said. But an unhealed fracture on the jaw indicates that at some time the jaw weakened and eventually broke. With a broken jaw, the pliosaur would not have been able to feed and that final accident probably led to her demise. Pliosaurs were probably pursuit or ambush predators, feeding on fish, squid and other marine reptiles but would also have been capable of scavenging. They were at the top of their food chains, so there would not have been any predators to take advantage of an aging, disabled pliosaur  except for another pliosaur. You can see these kinds of deformities in living animals, such as crocodiles or sperm whales and these animals can survive for years as long as they are still able to feed, said study co author Prof Mike Benton of the University of Bristol. But it must be painful. Remember that the fictional whale, Moby Dick from Herman Melvilles novel, was supposed to have had a crooked jawThe pliosaur from Westbury is an amazing example of how the study of disease paleopathologies in fossil animals can help us to reconstruct an extinct animals life history and behavior and to show that even a Jurassic killer could succumb to the diseases of old age."}, {"title": " Amber Reveals Pollinating Insects from Dinosaur Era", "author": "Enrico de Lazaro", "date": "May 15, 2012", "doc": "A team of European scientists has found several specimens of thrips with pollen grains captured in amber, providing the oldest known evidence of insect pollination. This synchrotron tomography image shows the specimen of Gymnospollisthrips minor studied at the ESRF. The pollen grains are highlighted in yellow ESRF Today, more than 80 of plant species rely on insects to transport pollen from male to female flower parts. Pollination is best known in flowering plants but also exists in so called gymnosperms, seed producing plants like conifers. Although the most popular group of pollinator insects are bees and butterflies, a myriad of lesser known species of flies, beetles or thrips have co evolved with plants, transporting pollen and in return for this effort being rewarded with food. During the last two decades, amber specimens from the Lower Cretaceous about 110 105 million years ago found in the Basque country in northern Spain have revealed many new plant and animal species, mainly insects. Two amber pieces from the collection of the Museo de Ciencias Naturales de \u00c1lava in Spain revealed six fossilized specimens of thysanopterans, so called thrips  a group of minute insects of less than 2 mm in length that feed on pollen and other plant tissues  with hundreds of pollen grains attached to their bodies. These insects exhibit highly specialized hairs with a ringed structure to increase their ability to collect pollen grains, very similar to the ones of well known pollinators like domestic bees. The scientists describe these specimens in a new genus comprising two new species Gymnopollisthrips minor and G. major. The most representative specimen was also studied with synchrotron X ray tomography at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ESRF in Grenoble, France, to reveal in three dimensions and at very high resolution the pollen grain distribution over the insects body. The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The pollen grains are very small and exhibit the adherent features needed so that insects can transport them. The scientists conclude that this pollen is from a kind of cycad or ginkgo tree, a kind of living fossil of which only a few species are known to science. Ginkgos trees are either male or female, and male trees produce small pollen cones whereas female trees bear ovules at the end of stalks which develop into seeds after pollination. For which evolutionary reason did these tiny insects, 100 million years ago, collect and transport Gingko pollen? Their ringed hairs cannot have grown due to an evolutionary selection benefiting the trees. The benefit for the thrips can only be explained by the possibility to feed their larvae with pollen. This suggests that this species formed colonies with larvae living in the ovules of some kind of gingko for shelter and protection, and female insects transporting pollen from the male Gingko cones to the female ovules to feed the larvae and at the same time pollinate the trees. Only amber can preserve behavioral features like pollination in such rich detail over millions of years. 100 million years ago, flowering plants started to diversify enormously, eventually replacing conifers as the dominant species.This is the oldest direct evidence for pollination, and the only one from the age of the dinosaurs, said Dr. Carmen Soriano, who led the investigation of the amber pieces with X ray tomography at the ESRF. The co evolution of flowering plants and insects, thanks to pollination, is a great evolutionary success story. It began about 100 million years ago, when this piece of amber fossil was produced by resin dropping from a tree, which today is the oldest fossil record of pollinating insects. Thrips might indeed turn out to be one of the first pollinator groups in geological history, long before evolution turned some of them into flower pollinators."}, {"title": " 11-Million-Year-Old Giant Panda\u2019s Cousin Found in Spain", "author": "Natali Anderson", "date": "May 10, 2012", "doc": "Scientists have discovered a new fossil species of bear that roamed what is now Spain in the Myocene period. Artists reconstruction of Agriarctos beatrix SINC The new ursid species, Agriarctos beatrix, was a small plantigrade omnivore and was genetically related to giant pandas. Its fossil remains have been found in the Nombrevilla 2 site in the province of Zaragoza, Spain. The study by researchers from the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Spain and the University of Valencia, published in the journal Estudios Geol\u00f3gicos, suggests that this creature lived during the Myocene period some 11 million years ago. This bear species was small, even smaller than the Sun bear  currently the smallest bear species, said to SINC Dr. Juan Abella, a researcher at the Department of Paleobiology of the Spains National Museum of Natural Sciences and a lead author of the study. It would not have weighed more than 60 kg. Although it is difficult to determine its physical appearance given that only pieces of dental fossils have been found, the scientists believe that it would have had dark fur with white spots mainly on the chest, around the eyes and possibly close to the tail. This fur pattern is considered primitive for bears, such as that of the giant panda whose white spots are so big that it actually seems to be white with black spots, Dr. Abella explained. A. beatrix would have lived in the forest and could have been more sessile that those bears that tend to hunt more, such as the brown or polar bears. This extinct bear would have escaped from other larger carnivores by climbing up trees. Its diet would have been similar to that of the Sun bear, Ursus malayanus, or the Spectacled bear, Tremarctos ornatus, that only eat vegetables and fruit and sometimes vertebrates, insects, honey and dead animals, Dr. Abella said. We know that it was a different species to those documented up until now because of its morphological differences and the size of its teeth, the scientist confirmed. We have compared it with species of the same kind Agriarctos and similar kinds from the same period Ursavus and Indarctos. The reasons for its extinction have yet to be determined but the most probable cause is likely to be the opening up of the forests giving way to more open, drier spaces and the appearance of similar yet larger and more competitive species, Dr. Abella said.The study now suggests the appearance of this group related to giant pandas some two millions years later, from 9 million years ago to 11 million years ago.

The Cretan dwarf mammoth may have looked like a dwarf version of this full size mammoth Tracy O The newly identified dwarf mammoth, Mammuthus creticus, lived on the Greek island Crete and was some 1 meter tall. It weighed about 300 kg, half the weight of the previous known smallest dwarf mammoth, M. lamarmorai. Fossils of M. creticus were unearthed in 1904 in Cape Malekas, Crete, and have been now re examined and identified by the Natural History Museums experts. It was previously thought that the Cretan dwarf mammoth was most likely a descendant of the extinct straight tusked elephant, Palaeoloxodon antiquus, because this was the ancestor of nearly all the other extinct dwarf elephants found on various Mediterranean islands including Sicily, Malta and Cyprus. But the new study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, shows that this was not the case. Our work has meant that we can not only show it is a mammoth, but also demonstrate it is the smallest mammoth known to have existed, said Dr. Victoria Herridge, an expert at the Natural History Museum. Mammoths had twisted tusks and a single domed head. But it is an elephants teeth that are most often preserved as fossils and these are used to tell elephant species apart. The teeth wear down during the animals life, creating a surface with enamel rings. The enamel rings on the Cretan tooth fossil had 3 character features that resembled mammoths, the genus Mammuthus, and, importantly, not the straight tusked elephant Palaeoloxodon, said Dr. Herridge. Once we had identified it as a mammoth, we then used tooth shape to help us work out which species of mammoth it was most like. They compared the Cretan specimen to species of elephant known to have lived in mainland Europe in the past, the 3 mammoth species, Mammuthus rumanus, M. meridionalis and M. trogontherii, as well as P. antiquus. They also discovered new fossils of the Cretan dwarf mammoth from the original Cape Malekas site, located using the notes and diaries of pioneering fossil hunter Dorothea Bate who collected the original Cretan specimens in 1904. A fragment of an upper arm bone allowed the team to take a measurement of the total bone length so they could reconstruct the size of the adult mammoth as approximately 1.1m tall. The findings show the Cretan specimen was most similar to the species M. meridionalis that lived in Europe 2.5 million to 800,000 years ago.  But we couldnt rule out another species M. rumanus, said Dr. Herridge. M. rumanus is the earliest species of mammoth found in Europe  as long ago as 3.5 million years. This means the ancestor of M. creticus could have reached Crete as long ago as 3.5 million years. Dwarfism is a well known evolutionary response of large mammals living on islands, known as the Island Rule which conversely includes small mammals becoming larger. However, the Cretan animal was not only a dwarf, it was an extreme dwarf.This is the first time that extreme island dwarfism has been shown to have occurred in mammoths, Dr. Herridge concluded."}, {"title": " First-Ever Discovery of Ceratosaur in Australia", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "May 8, 2012", "doc": "Fossilized remains of a ceratosaurian dinosaur discovered in Australia in 2006 is the first evidence that a major group of meat eating dinosaurs roamed the eastern part of the supercontinent Gondwana some 125 million years ago. An artists impression of the ceratosaur discovered in Australia Brian Choo The ceratosaur discovery, published in the journal Naturwissenschaften, improves understanding of the distribution and evolution of dinosaurs in eastern Gondwana, the supercontinent of which Australia was once a part. Until now, this group of dinosaurs has been strangely absent from Australia, but now at last we know they were here  confirming their global distribution, said Dr. Erich Fitzgerald, a paleontologist at the Museum Victoria and a lead author of the discovery paper. Carnivorous creatures one to two meters in height, ceratosaurs have been found in both the northern and southern hemispheres. This discovery joins other widespread carnivorous dinosaurs now known to have lived in Australia  tyrannosaurs, spinosaurids and allosaurs, Dr. Fitzgerald explained. The discovery also lends weight to the idea that Australia was once a melting pot of dinosaur diversity. It had been thought that isolation played a lead role in the formation of Australias dinosaur fauna, Dr. Fitzgerald said. But the ceratosaur and other new discoveries show that several dinosaur groups were here. These dinosaur lineages date back to the Jurassic, 170 million years ago, when dinosaurs could walk between any two continents.

The ceratosaur fossil, an ankle bone about 6 cm wide was found near the seaside town of San Remo, 87 kilometres southeast of Melbourne.Apart from Antarctica, Australia has the worlds most poorly known dinosaur record  one of the last frontiers for dinosaur hunters, Dr. Fitzgerald concluded.

The illustration shows the comparative sizes of ancientmodern crocodiles and ancientmodern humans Chris Brochu  University of Iowa Its the largest known true crocodile, said Dr. Christopher Brochu, an associate professor of geoscience at the University of Iowa and a lead author of the study published in the May 3 issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. It may have exceeded 27 feet in length. By comparison, the largest recorded Nile crocodile was less than 21 feet, and most are much smaller. The new species, called Crocodylus thorbjarnarsoni, resembled its living cousin, the Nile crocodile, but was more massive. Dr. Brochu recognized the new species from fossils that he examined three years ago at the National Museum of Kenya in Nairobi. Some were found at sites known for important human fossil discoveries. It lived alongside our ancestors, and it probably ate them, Dr. Brochu said. Although the fossils contain no evidence of humanreptile encounters, crocodiles generally eat whatever they can swallow, and humans of that time period would have stood no more than four feet tall. We dont actually have fossil human remains with croc bites, but the crocs were bigger than todays crocodiles, and we were smaller, so there probably wasnt much biting involved, Dr. Brochu explained. There likely would have been ample opportunity for humans to encounter crocs, he added. Thats because early man, along with other animals, would have had to seek water at rivers and lakes where crocodiles lie in wait. The new species is named after John Thorbjarnarson, famed crocodile expert and Dr. Brochus colleague who died of malaria while in the field several years ago. He was a giant in the field, so it only made sense to name a giant after him, Dr. Brochu said. I certainly miss him, and I needed to honor him in some way. I couldnt not do it. Among the skills needed for one to discover a new species of crocodile is, apparently, a keen eye. Not that the fossilized crocodile head is small  it took four men to lift it. But other experts had seen the fossil without realizing it was a new species. The Nairobi collection is beautiful and contains many fossils that have been incompletely studied, Dr. Brochu pointed out. So many discoveries could yet be made.C. thorbjarnarsoni is not directly related to the present day Nile crocodile, Dr. Brochu explained. This suggests that the Nile crocodile is a fairly young species and not an ancient living fossil, as many people believe. We really dont know where the Nile crocodile came from, but it only appears after some of these prehistoric giants died out."}, {"title": " Fossils of Rebel Coelacanth Discovered in Canada", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "May 4, 2012", "doc": "Canadian fossil collectors from the Peace Region Paleontology Research Center in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, have discovered fossils of a stunning 240 million year old species of coelacanth. The fast swimming coelacanth Rebellatrix chasing smaller species of fishes in the Early Triassic ocean west of Pangaea Michael Skrepnick Coelacanths are iconic fishes, well known as living fossils. The group was thought to have died out with the dinosaurs until a living one was caught in 1938 off the coast of South Africa, sending shock waves through the scientific world. The newly discovered species, described by two University of Alberta scientists in the recent issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, was a 3 foot long fish with a massive symmetrical forked tail quite unlike the tails of any other living or fossil coelacanths. The fossils were discovered on rocky slopes in the Hart Ranges of Wapiti Lake Provincial Park in British Columbia, which at the time the fish was alive was off the western coast of the supercontinent Pangaea. The species, named\u00a0Rebellatrix divaricerca, meaning the rebel coelacanth,\u00a0\u00a0represents the first major change in body shape for the coelacanth group in more than 70 million years.\u00a0The structure of this new fish\u00a0is so unusual that it has been put in its own family. The reason for its unusual shape comes down to two possibilities, said lead author Dr. Andrew Wendruff. Either the fossil record of coelacanths is vastly undiscovered and there are others like it yet to be found, or this was a specific response following the Earths greatest mass extinction event at the end of the Permian , as coelacanths evolved to fill a vacant niche unoccupied by other predatory fishes. Both the shape and the stiffness of the tail fin are unique amongst coelacanths, explained Dr. Mark Wilson, co author of the study. Similar tail fins occur today in fast swimming predatory fishes such as tuna or barracuda, strongly suggesting that Rebellatrix was an active predator capable of fast bursts of swimming and high speed cruising to search for and catch other fishes living in the ancient sea. This is an amazing discovery which overturns the age old image of coelacanths as slow moving fishes and shows the resilience of the group to come back in true fighting form after surviving the worlds most devastating mass extinction event, said Dr. John Long of the Natural History Museum of LA County, an expert in fossil fishes who was not involved in the study.Sci News.com has also recently reported the discovery of the oldest known coelacanth species from the Early Devonian of Yunnan, China."}, {"title": " Two Ancient Giant Flea Species Discovered in China", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "May 2, 2012", "doc": "Chinese scientists have discovered fossils of remarkable giant flea like animals that lived millions years ago in what is now China. An artists impression of Pseudopulex jurassicus Wang Cheng  Oregon State University These ancient creatures, described in the journal Current Biology, were probably 10 times the size of a flea you might find crawling on the family dog  with an extra painful bite to match. These were insects much larger than modern fleas and from the size of their proboscis we can tell they would have been mean, said George Poinar, Jr., a professor emeritus of zoology at Oregon State University, who wrote a commentary on the discovery in the same issue of the journal. You wouldnt talk much about the good old days if you got bit by this insect, Prof. Poinar explained. It would have felt about like a hypodermic needle going in  a flea shot, if not a flu shot. We can be thankful our modern fleas are not nearly this big. Its possible that the soft bodied, flea like insects found in these fossils from Inner Mongolia are the evolutionary ancestors of modern fleas, but most likely they belong to a separate and now extinct lineage, the researcher added. The newly discovered species, called Pseudopulex jurassicus and Pseudopulex magnus, had bodies that were more flat, like a bedbug or tick, and long claws that could reach over scales on the skin of dinosaurs so they could hold onto them tightly while sucking blood. Modern fleas are more laterally compressed and have shorter antennae, and are able to move quickly through the fur or feathers of their victims. These are really well preserved fossils that give us another glimpse of life into the really distant past, the Cretaceous and Jurassic, said Prof. Poinar, who has also studied younger fleas from 40 50 million years ago preserved in amber.All true fleas are adapted to feeding on warm blooded vertebrates, Prof. Poinar explained. And today 94 percent of the 2,300 known species attack mammals, while the remainder feed on birds. But the unusual characteristics and abilities of the flea like animals found in these fossils lead scientists to believe their prey were some of the biggest kids on the block  dinosaurs in which they could have fed on the softer skin between scales."}, {"title": " Amateur Paleontologist Discovers Enigmatic 450-Million-Year-Old Monster", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 27, 2012", "doc": "An amateur paleontologist has discovered a fossil of a very mysterious organism dubbed Godzillus that lived in shallow seas in what is now the Cincinnati region about 450 million years ago. In this April 20 photo, Ron Fine discusses the fossil he discovered with Carlton Brett, center, and David Meyer, right, professors of Geology at the University of Cincinnati AP Photo  The Cincinnati Enquirer  Gary Landers The fossilized specimen, a roughly elliptical shape with multiple lobes, totaling almost seven feet in length, was presented on April 24 at the 46th Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America. I knew right away that I had found an unusual fossil, said Ron Fine of Dayton, who discovered the fossil. He is a member of the Dry Dredgers, an association of amateur paleontologists based at the University of Cincinnati. Imagine a saguaro cactus with flattened branches and horizontal stripes in place of the usual vertical stripes, he added. Thats the best description I can give. The enigmatic fossil was excavated in 2011 from the lower Kope Formation near Covington, Kentucky. While those nodules can take on some fascinating, sculpted forms, I could tell instantly that this was not one of them, Fine said. There was an organic form to these shapes. They were streamlined. And then there was that surface texture. Nodules do not have surface texture. Theyre smooth. This fossil had an unusual texture on the entire surface. For more than 200 years, the rocks of the Cincinnati region have been among the most studied in all of paleontology, and the discovery of an unknown, and large, fossil has professional paleontologists scratching their heads. Its definitely a new discovery, said Dr. David Meyer of the University of Cincinnati, a co author of the presentation. And were sure its biological. We just dont know yet exactly what it is. To answer that key question, Dr. Meyer and his colleagues from the University of Cincinnati were working with Fine to reconstruct a timeline working backward from the fossil, through its preservation, burial, and death to its possible mode of life. What things had to happen in what order? Dr. Meyer asked. Something caused a directional pattern. How did that work? Was it there originally or is it post mortem? What was the burial event? How did the sediment get inside? Those are the kinds of questions we have. It has helped, that Fine has painstakingly reassembled the entire fossil, Dr. Meyer added. This is a daunting task, since the large specimen is in hundreds of pieces. Ive been fossil collecting for 39 years and never had a need to excavate. But this fossil just kept going, and going, and going, Fine explained. I had to make 12 trips, over the course of the summer, to excavate more material before I finally found the end of it. Even then Fine still had to guess as to the full size, because it required countless hours of cleaning and reconstruction to put it all back together. When I finally finished it was three and a half feet wide and six and a half feet long, he said. In a world of thumb sized fossils thats gigantic My personal theory is that it stood upright, with branches reaching out in all directions similar to a shrub, Fine said. If I am right, then the upper most branch would have towered nine feet high.  As Dr. Meyer with colleagues assist Fine in studying the specimen, they have found a clue to its life position in another fossil. The mystery fossil has several small, segmented animals known as primaspid trilobites attached to its lower surface. These small trilobites are sometimes found on the underside of other fossilized animals, where they were probably seeking shelter. A better understanding of that trilobites behavior will likely help us better understand this new fossil, Fine said. Although the team has reached out to other specialists, no one has been able to find any evidence of anything similar having been found.The mystery monster seems to defy all known groups of organisms, Fine concluded.

Two adult horses Hipparion zandaense running fast in their open steppe habitat of the Tibetan Plateau Yu Chen In their paper, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, the scientists report the discovery of a well preserved skeleton of three toed horse, named Hipparion zandaense. The fossilized\u00a0specimen of H. zandaense was collected in August 2009 from the Zanda Basin, southwestern Tibet. The Tibetan Plateau is the youngest and highest plateau on the planet. Its elevation reaches one third of the height of the troposphere, with profound dynamic and thermal effects on atmospheric circulation and climate. The uplift of the plateau was an important factor of global climate change during the late Cenozoic and strongly influenced the development of the Asian monsoon system. There have been hot debates about the history and process of Tibetan Plateau uplift. Because both morphology and attachment impressions on fossilized bones can reflect muscular and ligamentous situations, they can provide evidence for the type of locomotion that extinct animals used when they lived. The skeleton of H. zandaense preserved all limb bones, pelvis, and partial vertebrae, which provide an opportunity to reconstruct its locomotive function. Morphological features indicate that H. zandaense was a cursorial horse that lived in alpine steppe habitats. The horse had the ability to run fast and stand persistently, which is beneficial only on open habitats, because close forests would encumber running. Because this open landscape would be situated above the timberline on the steep southern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, the elevation of the Zanda Basin about 4.6 million years ago was estimated to be about 4 km above sea level using an adjustment to the temperature in the middle Pliocene as well as comparison with modern vegetation vertical zones.The scientists conclude that the southwestern Tibet achieved the present day elevation in the mid Pliocene."}, {"title": " Egg-Laying May Have Caused Dinosaur Extinction", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "Apr 18, 2012", "doc": "An international team of researchers has found why and how egg laying reproduction may have led to the extinction of dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus rex, one of the biggest dinosaurs Nobu Tamura Weighing in at four tons, the mother animal was 2,500 times heavier than its newly hatched dinosaur baby. By way of comparison, a mother elephant, which is just as heavy, only weighs 22 times as much as its new born calf. In other words, neonates are already big in large mammal species. After all, larger eggs require a thicker shell and as the embryo also needs to be supplied with oxygen through this shell, eventually neither the shell nor the egg can grow any more.\u00a0Consequently, newly hatched dinosaur babies cannot be larger in the same way as in larger species of mammal. In addition, new born mammals occupy the same ecological niche as their parents. As they are fed with milk directly by the mother, they do not take any niche away from smaller species. With large dinosaurs, however, it was a different story. They did not only occupy the adults one niche during their lifetime, but also had many of their own to pass through  from niches for animals with a body size of a few kilos and those for ten, 100 and 1,000 kg animals to those that were occupied by the fully grown forms of over 30 tons. The consensus among researchers is that animals of particular body sizes occupy particular niches, said study lead author Dr. Daryl Codron of the University of Zurich. In the case of the dinosaurs, this would mean that a single species occupied the majority of the ecological niches while mammals occupied these through numerous species of different sizes. The study, published in the journal Biology Letters, reveals that dinosaurs of a small and medium body size were represented with far fewer individual species than was the case in mammals  because their niches were occupied by the young of larger species. An overview of the body sizes of all dinosaur species  including those of birds, which are also dinosaurs after all  reveals that few species existed with adults weighing between two and sixty kilograms, Dr. Codron explained. Firstly, this absence of small and medium sized species was due to the competition among the dinosaurs in mammals, there was no such gap, said Dr. Marcus Clauss of the University of Zurich, a study co author. Secondly, in the presence of large dinosaurs and the ubiquitous competition from their young, mammals did not develop large species themselves. The third insight that the computer simulation illustrates concerns small dinosaurs. They were in competition both among their own ranks and with small mammals. And this increased pressure brought the small dinosaurs either to the brink of extinction or forced them to conquer new niches. The latter enabled them to guarantee their survival up to the present day, as Dr. Codron concluded, since back then, they had to take to the air as birds. The dinosaurs supremacy as the largest land animals remained intact for 150 million years. The mass extinction at the Cretaceous Tertiary boundary, however, spelled trouble as the species gap in the medium size range turned out to be disastrous for them."}, {"title": " Earliest Known Coelacanth Species Discovered", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Apr 16, 2012", "doc": "An international team of researchers has discovered the fossilized skull of a new species of coelacanth, which is more than 400 million years old, about 17 million years older than previous specimens. Reconstruction of Euporosteus yunnanensis Brian Choo The new study, published on April 10 in the journal Nature Communications, reports the earliest known fossilized skull of new coelacanth species, called Euporosteus yunnanensis, from the Early Devonian of Yunnan, China, which represents the first record of an anatomically modern coelacanth before the late Middle Devonian. Among sarcopterygians lobe finned fishes and tetrapods, coelacanths are known for their evolutionary conservatism. Epitomized by the legendary living fossil Latimeria, the distinctive body plan of anatomically modern coelacanths can be traced back to fossil forms from the late Middle Devonian. However, the groups early history is unclear because of an incomplete fossil record. The new form extends the chronological range of the anatomically modern coelacanths by about 17 million years, and adds to the growing body of evidence pointing to the South China block as the centre for sarcopterygian diversification, from which coelacanth representatives were peculiarly absent until now. The new materials, consisting of a parietonasal shield and a postparietal shield, were collected in 2009 and 2011 from a yellow sandstone layer of the Posongchong Formation, Yunnan, China. An important question for studying patterns of the coelacanth evolution is when the anatomically modern coelacanths developed their distinctive body plan. The early fossil record of coelacanths has been scarce, and opinions differ on which sarcopterygian taxon is the closest sister group of coelacanths. So far, the earliest record of the traditionally defined coelacanth group is one isolated dentary, Eoactinistia, from the Early Devonian of Australia. Because of its limited morphological features, Eoactinistia cannot be subjected to a phylogenetic analysis and its position within the coelacanths is unknown, said Dr. Xiaobo Yu, a study co author and a professor at Kean University in New Jersey. Contrary to all expectations for such an early form, Eoactinistia possesses the large dentary sensory pore present in coelacanths from the Carboniferous and younger age, but absent from any of the MiddleLate Devonian forms. The presence of the dentary pore raises the tantalizing possibility that Eoactinistia may be an anatomically modern coelacanth, previously known only from the late Middle Devonian and younger age. However, the unknown phylogenetic position of Eoactinistia and the lack of any other Early Devonian coelacanth fossils make it impossible to weigh this possibility against other possibilities, that is, the dentary pore as an independently derived feature that arose twice among coelacanths, or as a primitive feature that was lost in other Devonian forms but then reappeared in later coelacanths, said Dr. Min Zhu of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, a lead author of the study. The new material resembles Euporosteus eifeliensis from the Middle Devonian of Germany and reveals unique features to justify the erection of a new species, Dr. Zhu explained. Phylogenetic analysis places the new form together with Euporosteus eifeliensis crownward of Diplocercides or as its sister taxon. The finding expands the existing knowledge of Euporosteus, and represents the first record of an anatomically modern coelacanth before the late Middle Devonian,\u00a0 It lends support to the possibility that the dentary pore of Eoactinistia may be a synapomorphy indicating its membership among the anatomically modern coelacanths, previously known only from the late Middle Devonian and younger age.A recent study of the HOX clusters of the Indonesian coelacanth Latimeria menadoensis found features indicating stasis in genome evolution that may be correlated with the stasis in morphological evolution, Dr. Yu said. This finding provides a more refined reference point for studying the rapid early diversification and subsequent evolutionary conservatism of the coelacanths."}, {"title": " Oldest Reptile Embryos Discovered", "author": "Sergio Prostak", "date": "Apr 12, 2012", "doc": "An international team of paleontologists has unearthed the oldest known fossil reptile embryos dating back about 280 million years.

Although the oldest known adult amniote fossils date back some 315 million years, very few collections of fossil eggs and embryos are available to paleontologists.

This is the first time the eggs are found in a close proximity to skeletal remains of an alvarezsaurid dinosaur.

The team, including researchers from the University of Alberta and five Chinese institutions, notes that these three specimens were acquired from a fossil dealer who stated that they were collected from a single quarry. However, the dealer could not provide accurate information as to the exact quarry in which the specimens were collected. Yutyrannus lived in what is now northeastern China about 125 million years ago and weighed at least 1.4 tons. The body length of this creature is estimated to be about 9 meters.

The skull of Yutyrannus huali Xing Xu et al The feathers of Yutyrannus were simple filaments, explained Prof. Xing Xu of Beijings Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, a lead author of the study. They were more like the fuzzy down of a modern baby chick than the stiff plumes of an adult bird. The name of the creature means beautiful feathered tyrant in a combination of Latin and Mandarin. As a living animal, Yutyrannus was smaller than its infamous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, but about 60 times as heavy as Sinocalliopteryx and 40 times as heavy as Beipiaosaurus, previously ranked as the largest known feathered non avian dinosaurs.

Fossil skull of Guidraco venator Xiaolin Wang et al The new species called Guidraco venator is described in the April issue of the journal Naturwissenschaften. The specimen of this flying reptile, which lived about 120 million years ago,  a skull with most elements articulated or in close association and the anterior portion of a neck  was collected from the Early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation, Lingyuan City, western Liaoning, China. The skull is 380 mm long with the rostrum occupying 54 of the cranial length. G. venator has a nasoantorbital fenestra, a typical trait of the Pterodactyloidea. It has an unusual upward directed frontal crest and large rostral teeth, some of which surpass the margins of the skull and lower jaw when occluded. It differs from the pteranodontoid Istiodactylidae and the Pteranodontidae by features such as the dentition and the shape of the nasoantobital fenestra. A frontal crest is present in pteranodontids but, in all cases, differs from that of Guidraco. The cranial morphology clearly indicates that Guidraco is closely related to a rare taxon Ludodactylus from the Brazilian Crato Formation of Araripe Basin, with whom it shares the rounded ventral margin of the orbit and an extensive frontal crest. The main differences found in the Chinese taxon that justifies the separation at a generic level are the more inclined rostral teeth, the direction and position of the frontal crest, the absence of a spike like lacrimal process, the comparatively smaller nasoantorbital fenestra, and the more constricted ventral portion of lower temporal fenestra. Luddodactylus was reported to bear a dentary crest, but none could be found in Guidraco. Our overall knowledge regarding the distribution of those volant vertebrates is still very limited compared to other Mesozoic reptiles such as nonavian dinosaurs, said Dr. Alexander Kellner, a co author on the study and a professor at Museu Nacional Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In particular, the paucity of the African record, where most specimens are rather incomplete, hampers a more comprehensive knowledge of the pterosaur evolutionary history. Nonetheless, there have been suggestions that several of the main Early Cretaceous pterodactyloid clades may have originated in Asia such as the Anhangueridae and the Tapejaridae. The occurrence of Guidraco is consistent with that hypothesis.Several cranial elements such as the frontal and the premaxillae are unfused suggesting that this was a subadult animal at time of death, added Dr. Wang. The association of the new specimen with coprolites and the cranial morphology suggest that G. venator preyed on fish."}, {"title": " Study Suggests Humans Caused Extinction of Australian Megafauna", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "Mar 26, 2012", "doc": "A team of researchers led by Dr. Susan Rule of the Australian National University has found that human arrival rather than climate change caused the extinction of Australias prehistoric giant animals. Diprotodon, a member of the Australian megafauna known as the Giant Wombat Peter Trusler  Museum Victoria Analyzing a 130,000 year time sequence of sediments from Lynchs Crater in north east Queensland in the study, published in the journal Science, the team suggests that the Australian megafauna  which included cow sized browsing marsupials, giant kangaroos and a massive goanna  rapidly declined in numbers some 40,000 years ago,\u00a0soon after people are thought to have first arrived in the region. Prof. Chris Turney of the University of New South Wales, who led the age modeling component of the study, said that it offers new insights into the long running scientific debate about the relative roles humans and environmental change in the extinction of the megafauna. The crucial thing is that dating the demise of the magnificent megafauna is terribly difficult given the great antiquity and the coincidence with human arrival in Australia, he explained. At over 40,000 years ago, its hard to demonstrate which happened first. Excitingly, in this study  regardless of the differences in the absolute ages  we have a sedimentary record from tropical Queensland that preserves measures of different environmental changes. This allows us to test what happened first. Importantly, the sediments preserve the spore of a fungus that grows in herbivore dung and crucially this shows a long term decline around 40,000 years ago, Prof. Turney said. In this study, we find the fungus drops away before other environmental changes that could be interpreted as drying took place, implying humans played a significant role in the cause of Australian megafaunal extinction. Although not the definitive answer, this provides a new insight into the complex changes that were happening in the Australian landscape all those years ago. Prof. Ross Johnson of the University of Tasmania, a co author on the study, noted Lakes and swamps preserve spores of specialized fungi that live in the dung of large herbivores. As those sediments accumulate over time, they create a historical record of the abundance of very large herbivores in the environment. Pollen and charcoal particles are trapped in the same sediments, so that it is possible to match up the history of abundance of large herbivores with changes in vegetation and fire. The study rules out climate change as a cause of extinction, Prof. Johnson concluded. Several periods of climate drying before the extinction had no effect on the abundance of megafauna and the climate was stable when the animals went extinct.The results also suggest that major ecological change were followed quickly after the extinctions, with a shift from rainforest patches and open grassland to widespread eucalypt forest."}, {"title": " Paleontologists Discover Extinct Species of Scops Owl", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 24, 2012", "doc": "An international team of paleontologists has discovered a new species of fossil scops owl, the first extinct bird on the archipelago of Madeira, Portugal. Illustration of the common European scops owl and the extinct Otus mauli species from Madeira Pau Oliver Twenty years ago, fossil remains of a small nocturnal bird of prey were discovered in Madeira by the German researcher Harald Pieper, but had not been studied in depth. Now, the team has shown that the remains belong to a previously unknown extinct species of scops owl. A study, published in the journal Zootaxa, suggests that a new species called Otus mauli could be a land inhabiting scops owl that ate invertebrates and occasionally lizards or birds. It has long legs and wings slightly shorter than the continental European scops owl from which it derives, said Dr. Josep Antoni Alcover, a co author on the study and a researcher at the Mediterranean Institute for Advanced Studies. It is likely that their extinction is linked to the arrival of humans and the fauna they brought with them. Their disappearance formed part of a pattern of extinction of the islands species, which occurred in virtually all the islands of the world. According to the team, amongst the causes of extinction of this scops owl, the destruction of its habitat is highlighted, as Madeira had a lot of serious fires during the seven years that followed the Portuguese arrival. Furthermore, humans brought new birds with diseases that were unfamiliar to the native species, as well as rats and mice that could prey on eggs of animals that had nests close to the ground. The same or a similar species has been investigated in Porto Santo, another island of the archipelago of Madeira. This is extremely interesting, Dr. Alcover said, But difficult to assess because the materials found are limited and fragmented. If the scops owls of Madeira and Porto Santo were different species, it would mean that the Otus flying ability is much more limited than continental scops owls. The distance between the two islands would be enough to isolate them. The homogeneity of the scops owls measurements on the two islands, as well as the differences compared to European scops owls suggests that they were genetically isolated from the European populations. The distance between the continent and the island was enough to explain the difference in the species. On this island the team expects to discover new species of birds in the near future, which will report a world that disappeared just a few hundred years ago.The same thing will happen in the Azores islands where there is already evidence that a scops owl different to the ones in Madeira and Europe that is also extinct, Dr. Alcover concluded."}, {"title": " Scientists Discover Sharpest Teeth in History", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "Mar 20, 2012", "doc": "A team of scientists from Monash University and the University of Bristol has found that the tiny teeth of a long extinct prehistoric fish are the sharpest that have ever been recorded. The teeth of the prehistoric conodont David Jones et al.  Monash University  University of Bristol A study, published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, shows that the teeth of conodonts, a group that first appeared around 500 million years ago, were easily able to bite through the animals food despite measuring only a millimeter in length. The fragile nature of the tiny fossil remains of animals that died out more than 200 million years ago meant scientists had to create virtual 3D models of the material using x rays from a particle accelerator in Japan before they could conduct thorough research. Evidence suggested the conodonts were the first vertebrates to develop teeth, said Dr. Alistair Evans of Monash Universitys School of Biological Sciences, a co author on the study. Conodonts had no other skeleton than the teeth in their mouths. These came together a bit like scissors, to slice up food. The findings offered insights into the evolution of teeth in larger vertebrates, including humans. The conodonts took an alternative route through evolution to humans, who developed less efficient, but less breakable, blunter teeth, to which greater force can be applied by jaw muscles, Dr. Evans explained.The sharpness of conodont teeth allowed them to overcome the limitations of their small size. Since pressure is simply force applied divided by area, to increase pressure you must either increase the force or shrink the area. Conodont evolution took the latter route, allowing them to apply enough pressure to break up their food."}, {"title": " Study Suggests Some Mammals Competed with Dinosaurs", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 15, 2012", "doc": "An international team of researchers has found that rodent like creatures called multituberculates flourished during the last 20 million years of the dinosaurs reign and survived their extinction 66 million years ago. An artists conception depicts a multituberculate in its natural habitat at the time of the dinosaurs Jude Swales  Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture A study, published online in the journal Nature, suggests that the multituberculates did so well in part because they developed numerous tubercles bumps, or cusps on their back teeth that allowed them to feed largely on angiosperms, flowering plants that were just becoming commonplace. These mammals were able to radiate in terms of numbers of species, body size and shapes of their teeth, which influenced what they ate, said Dr. Gregory Wilson, lead author of the paper and an assistant professor of biology at the University of Washington. Some 170 million years ago, multituberculates were about the size of a mouse. Angiosperms started to appear about 140 million years ago and after that the small mammals body sizes increased, eventually ranging from mouse sized to the size of a beaver. Following the dinosaur extinction, multituberculates continued to flourish until other mammals  mostly primates, ungulates and rodents  gained a competitive advantage. That ultimately led to multituberculate extinction about 34 million years ago. The scientists examined teeth from 41 multituberculate species kept in fossil collections worldwide. They used laser and computed tomography or CT scanning to create 3 D images of the teeth in very high resolution, less than 30 microns smaller than one third the diameter of a human hair. Using geographic information system software, they analyzed the tooth shape much as a geographer might in examining a mountain range when charting topography, Dr. Wilson said. The research involved determining which direction various patches of the tooth surfaces were facing. The more patches on a tooth the more complex its structure, and the most complex teeth show many bumps, or cusps. Carnivores have relatively simple teeth, with perhaps 110 patches per tooth row, because their food is easily broken down, Dr. Wilson said. But animals that depend more on vegetation for sustenance have teeth with substantially more patches because much of their food is broken down by the teeth. In multituberculates, sharper bladelike teeth were situated toward the front of the mouth. But the new analysis shows that in some multituberculates these teeth became less prominent over time and the teeth in the back became very complex, with as many as 348 patches per tooth row, ideal for crushing plant material. If you look at the complexity of teeth, it will tell you information about the diet, Dr. Wilson explained. Multituberculates seem to be developing more cusps on their back teeth, and the bladelike tooth at the front is becoming less important as they develop these bumps to break down plant material. The researchers concluded that some angiosperms apparently suffered little effect from the dinosaur extinction event, since the multituberculates that ate those flowering plants continued to prosper.As the plants spread, the population of insect pollinators likely grew too and species feeding on insects also would have benefited, Dr. Wilson said."}, {"title": " Two New Species of Horned Dinosaurs Identified", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "Mar 13, 2012", "doc": "A team of paleontologists has identified two new species of horned dinosaurs, known from fossils found in Alberta, Canada. Unescoceratops koppelhusae upper right and Gryphoceratops morrisonii   new leptoceratopsid dinosaurs from Alberta, Canada Julius T. Csotonyi A study, published in the journal Cretaceous Research, describes two new species of horned dinosaurs from the Leptoceratopsidae family, called Unescoceratops koppelhusae and Gryphoceratops morrisoni. They lived during the Late Cretaceous period between 75 to 83 million years ago. These dinosaurs fill important gaps in the evolutionary history of small bodied horned dinosaurs that lack the large horns and frills of relatives like Triceratops from North America, said Dr. Michael Ryan, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and lead author on the study. Although horned dinosaurs originated in Asia, our analysis suggests that leptoceratopsids radiated to North America and diversified here, since the new species, Gryphoceratops, is the earliest record of the group on this continent. U. koppelhusae measured about one to two meters 6.5 feet in length and weighed less than 91 kilograms 200 pounds. It had a short frill extending from behind its head but did not have ornamentation on its skull. It had a parrot like beak. Its teeth were lower and rounder than those of any other leptoceratopsid. In addition, its hatchet shaped jaw had a distinct portion of bone that projected below the jaw like a small chin. The lower left jaw fragment of Unescoceratops was discovered in 1995 in Dinosaur Provincial Park, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization UNESCO World Heritage Site by Dr. Philip Currie, now of the University of Alberta. Originally described in 1998 by Ryan and Currie, the dinosaur was referred to as Leptoceratops. Subsequent research by Ryan and David Evans, Ph.D., of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Canada, determined the specimen was a new genus and species. The species is named for Dr. Eva Koppelhus, a palynologist at the University of Alberta and wife of Dr. Currie. G. morrisoni had a shorter and deeper jaw shape than any other leptoceratopsid. Researchers believe the individual was a full grown adult. Based on unique characteristics of the jaw and its size, the researchers believe that Gryphoceratops was an adult that did not exceed one half meter in length. This means it is the smallest adult sized horned dinosaur in North America and one of the smallest adult sized plant eating dinosaurs known. Lower right jaw fragments of Gryphoceratops were discovered in southern Alberta in 1950 by Levi Sternberg while he worked for the Royal Ontario Museum. The species is named in honor of Ian Morrison, a Royal Ontario Museum technician, who discovered how the bones fit together.Small bodied dinosaurs are typically poorly represented in the fossil record, which is why fragmentary remains like these new leptoceratopsids can make a big contribution to our understanding of dinosaur ecology and evolution, concluded Dr. David Evans, a co author of the paper and associate curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Royal Ontario Museum and assistant professor at the University of Toronto."}, {"title": " Researchers Discover Iridescence in Microraptor", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Mar 12, 2012", "doc": "A team of researchers has discovered that plumage of Microraptor, a pigeon sized dinosaur that lived about 120 million years ago, was iridescent with a glossy sheen like the feathers of a modern crow. Artists rendering of Microraptor in its ancient habitat Jason Brougham  UT Austin The discovery, published in the journal Science, shows that the tail feathering of Microraptor was ornamental, and likely evolved for courtship and other social interactions. Most aspects of early dinosaur feathering continue to be interpreted as fundamentally aerodynamic, optimized for some aspect of aerial locomotion, said Dr. Julia Clarke, a co author of the paper and a paleontologist at the University of Texas at Austin UT Austin. Some of these structures were clearly ancestral characteristics that arose for other functions and stuck around, while others may be linked to display behaviors or signaling of mate quality. Feather features were shaped by early locomotor styles, the paleontologist explained. But, as any birder will tell you, feather colors and shapes may also be tied with complex behavioral repertoires and, if anything, may be costly in terms of aerodynamics. The feather color displayed by many modern birds is partially produced by arrays of pigment bearing organelles called melanosomes, about a hundred of which can fit across a human hair. Generally found in a round or cigar like shape, a melanosomes structure is constant for a given color. Iridescence arises when narrow melanosomes are organized in stacked layers. After a breakthrough by Dr. Jakob Vinther of UT Austin in 2009, paleontologists started analyzing the shape of melanosomes in well preserved fossilized feather imprints. By comparing these patterns to those in living birds, scientists can infer the color of dinosaurs that lived many millions of years ago. Modern birds use feathers for many different things, ranging from flight to thermoregulation to mate attracting displays, said Dr. Matt Shawkey, a paper co author and a biologist at the University of Akron. Iridescence is widespread in modern birds, and is frequently used in displays. The evidence that Microraptor was largely iridescent suggests that feathers were important for display even relatively early in their evolution. Based on the new data from Microraptor and other findings, a complex color repertoire that includes iridescence is likely ancestral to a group of dinosaurs called Paraves that originated at least 140 million years ago. It includes dinosaurs like Velociraptor as well as Archaeopteryx, Anchiornis and living birds.This study gives us an unprecedented glimpse of what this animal Microraptor looked like when it was alive, concluded Dr. Mark Norell, a paper co author and a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History."}, {"title": " New Permian Fish Discovered in Brazil", "author": "Sergio Prostak", "date": "Feb 27, 2012", "doc": "Dr. Eliseu Vieira Dias of the State University of Western Paran\u00e1 UNIOESTE has announced the discovery of a new species of deep bodied fish that prowled ancient rivers and lakes in the South American part of Gondwana during Permian period. A fossil of Paranaichthys longianalis E.V. Dias A paper in the journal Zootaxa describes a new species of deep bodied fossil fish, called Paranaichthys longianalis, which also represents a new genus belonging to the Actinopterygii the largest subclass of ray finned fishes. A single fossilized specimen of P. longianalis was collected from the Rio do Rasto Formation in Paran\u00e1 Basin, Brazil. As mentioned in the paper, the single specimen of this fossil fish was discovered in 1989 by Dr. Rosemarie Rohn of the State University of Paulista, Dr. Dias explained in the interview with Sci News.com. Dr. Rohn found the specimen in waste pile of a small mine. The fossil was preserved in the collection of the Museum of Science and Technology in Porto Alegre, Brazil. The discovery was for the first time presented in 1996. Now, some features of the new fish have been revised and appeared in Zootaxa. The researcher noted that this fossil fish lived in freshwater habits in the southwestern part of Gondwana about 268 260 million years ago the Upper Permian. P. longianalis is a deep bodied fish that has an elongated anal fin deep bodied fishes are those of laterally compressed body shapes, usually as tall as long, Dr. Dias said. The cranial features are poorly preserved in the specimen. However, the presence of crushing dentition indicates a hard food diet for this species. This crushing dentition presents a small cap of an enameloid tissue known as verruciform acrodin, Dr. Dias explained. The scales are ganoid with a three layer organization, in which the inner layer is composed of bone tissue, the intermediate is dentine and the external is enamel ganoine. The flank scales are high, a pattern common in deep bodied fishes. P. longianalis measured about 8.5 inches 21.5 cm and had remarkably large and long anal fin, a feature unknown in all other deep bodied actinopterygians. The name of the species refers to this remarkable fin, while the genus name refers to the Paran\u00e1 sedimentary Basin, where the fossil was found. This fossil fish probably lived together with other actinopterygians, amphibian temnospondyls such as Australerpeton cosgriffi, chondrichthyans and dipnoans. It would have been able to develop short fast movements using its strong caudal peduncle and well developed caudal fin.This is the second actinopterygian species, described from the Rio do Rasto Formation in Paran\u00e1 Basin, and the first deep bodied, Dr. Dias concluded. This geological formation is in the focus of several researches and many new fossil taxa described, including the discovery of carnivorous dinocephalian by Cisneros et al. in 2012, which is not cited in my paper.

Artists reconstruction of Sifrhippus sandrae at right touching noses with a modern Morgan horse Illustration by Danielle Byerley, Florida Museum of Natural History This horse lived in the forests of North America 56 million years ago, including during a 175,000 year interval of time known as the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum PETM. When average global temperatures rose by some 10 degrees Fahrenheit during this period, about a third of mammal species responded with significant reduction in size. By analyzing the size and the chemistry of the Sifrhippus fossil teeth found in Wyoming, the team has tried to figure out what the environment was like when the teeth were growing. The results, published in the international journal Science, show that S. sandrae initially weighed in at around 12 pounds 5.6 kg, but then shrank by approximately 30 percent to the size of a small housecat about 8.5 pounds or 4 kg at the start of the PETM, when climate warmed. Then, the species grew abruptly at the end of the period as climate cooled, reaching about 15 pounds 7 kg. The scientists have suggested that rising temperatures or high concentrations of carbon dioxide primarily caused the phenomenon in S. sandrae and other mammals during this period. For the first time, going back into deep time  going back tens of millions of years  we were able to show that indeed temperature was causing essentially a one to one shift in body size within this lineage of horse, explained Dr. Jonathan Bloch, a co author on the study and an associate curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Florida Museum of Natural History of the University of Florida in Gainesville. Because its over a long enough time, you can argue very strongly that what youre looking at is natural selection and evolution  that its actually corresponding to the shift in temperature and driving the evolution of these horses. This is the highest resolution terrestrial record of its kind from anywhere in the world and it shows how climate changed in Wyoming at that time, said Dr. Ross Secord of the University of Nebraska Lincoln, lead author on the paper. When Jon and I started plotting oxygen data from the mass spectrometer, we could immediately see that the shifts in size of horses and temperature were mirror images of each other. The findings also raise important questions about how animals might respond to rapid global warming in the near future. Were seeing about a third of the mammals getting smaller and some of them getting a lot smaller, by as much as half of their original body size, Dr. Secord said. Because warming happened much slower during the PETM, mammals had more time to adjust their body size. So, its not clear that were going to see the same thing happening in the near future, but we might. The researchers also analyzed correlations with aridity and carbon dioxide levels but confirmed temperature to be the most likely driving factor in body size.Although little is known about how animals arrived in North America at that time, the PETM is a significant event in geologic time in terms of mammalian history, Dr. Bloch said.\u00a0The PETM is really important because it marks the beginning for the first appearance of several major groups of mammals, including crown group primates ancestors of modern primates and the first even  and odd toed modern ungulates mammals with hooves.

At the discovered site, located near Wuda in Inner Mongolia, China, the plants were preserved as they fell, in many cases in the exact locations where they grew, because volcanic ash covered them over the course of only a few days. Its marvelously preserved, said Hermann Pfefferkorn, a Professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a co author on the study.

A modern day bushcricket Jackins In the Jurassic the world was host to a diversity of sounds. Primitive bushcrickets and croaking amphibians were among the first animals to produce loud sounds by rubbing certain body parts together. Modern day bushcrickets  also known as katydids  produce mating calls by rubbing a row of teeth on one wing against a plectrum on the other wing. But how their primitive ancestors produced sound and what their songs actually sounded like was unknown  until now. Chinese paleontologists, including Jun Jie Gu and Prof. Dong Ren from the Capital Normal University in Beijing, recently discovered an exceptionally detailed bushcricket fossil from the Mid Jurassic period and provided it to their colleagues  Dr. Fernando Montealegre Zapata and Prof. Daniel Robert, both experts in the biomechanics of singing and hearing in insects at the University of Bristol. According to the University of Bristol, the specimen had such well preserved wing features that the details of its stridulating organs were clearly visible under an optical microscope. It was identified as a new fossil species and named Archaboilus musicus by the team. Dr Montealegre Zapata and Prof. Robert examined the anatomical construction of the fossils song apparatus, and compared it to 59 living bushcricket species. They concluded that this animal must have produced musical songs, broadcasting pure, single frequencies. In the study, published yesterday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers reveal that this prehistoric species of bushcricket radiated musical songs using a resonant mechanism tuned at a specific frequency. Fossilized specimen of Archaboilus musicus red arrows show the location of bushcrickets song apparatus Fernando Montealegre Zapata et al This discovery indicates that pure tone communication was already exploited by animals in the middle Jurassic, some 165 million years ago, Prof. Robert said. For Archaboilus, as for living bushcricket species, singing constitutes a key component of mate attraction. Singing loud and clear advertises the presence, location and quality of the singer, a message that females choose to respond to  or not. Using a single tone, the males call carries further and better, and therefore is likely to serenade more females. However, it also makes the male more conspicuous to predators if they have also evolved ears to eavesdrop on these mating calls. Dr. Montealegre  Zapata established that A. musicus sang a tone pitched at 6.4kHz and that every bout of singing lasted 16 milliseconds. This turned out to be enough information to acoustically reconstruct the song itself, possibly the most ancient known musical song documented to date.  Using a low pitched song, A. musicus was acoustically adapted to long distance communication in a lightly cluttered environment, such as a Jurassic forest, Dr. Montealegre  Zapata said. Today, all species of katydids that use musical calls are nocturnal so musical calls in the Jurassic were also most likely an adaptation to nocturnal life. Being nocturnal, A. musicus probably escaped from diurnal predators like Archaeopterix, but it cannot be ruled out that Jurassic insectivorous mammals like Morganucodon and Dryolestes also listened to the calls of Archaboilus and preyed on them.This Jurassic bushcricket thus sheds light on the potential auditory capacity of other animals, and helps us learn a little more about the ambiance of a world long gone. It also suggests the evolutionary mechanisms that drove modern bushcrickets to develop ultrasonic signals for sexual pairing and for avoiding an increasingly relevant echolocating predator, but that only happened 100 million years later, possibly with the appearance of bats, the researcher concluded."}, {"title": " Paleontologists Identified New Species of Ancient Crocodile", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "Feb 1, 2012", "doc": "A team of paleontologists has identified a new species of prehistoric crocodile, nicknamed Shieldcroc due to a thick skinned shield on its head. A portion of its fossilized skull was unearthed from the Cenomanian Kem Kem Formation of southeastern Morocco several years ago. Life restoration of Aegisuchus witmeri Henry P. Tsai  University of Missouri The study, published in the journal PLoS One, suggests that the new species, called Aegisuchus witmeri, measured about 30 feet\u00a0in length and had 5 foot long flat skull with large jaw and craniocervical muscles. Scientists often estimate body size of crocodilians based on the size of the skull, said Nick Gardner, a co author on the study and an undergraduate researcher at Marshall University. However, estimating the body size of Shieldcroc was difficult, due to the enormous size of the skull compared to other crocodilians. To make a size estimate, we compared several features of the bone to many different species. Aegisuchus witmeri or Shieldcroc is the earliest ancestor of our modern crocodiles to be found in Africa, said Dr. Casey Holliday, co researcher and assistant professor of anatomy in the University of Missouris School of Medicine. Along with other discoveries, we are finding that crocodile ancestors are far more diverse than scientists previously realized. Shieldcroc lived in the Late Cretaceous period, about 95 million years ago. A portion of Aegisuchus witmeris fossilized skull Casey Holliday et al This period is part of the Mesozoic Era, which has been referred to as the Age of the Dinosaurs, however, numerous recent discoveries have led to some scientists calling the era the Age of the Crocs, Dr. Holliday said. The paleontologists identified Shieldcroc by studying a specimen held by the Royal Ontario Museum of Toronto for few years before they analyzed it. We believe Shieldcroc may have used its long face as a fish trap, Gardner said. It is possible that it lay in wait until an unsuspecting fish swam in front of it. Then, if it was close enough, Shieldcroc simply opened its mouth and ate the fish without a struggle, eliminating the need for strong jaws. Aegisuchus witmeri is named in honor of Lawrence M. Witmer, in recognition of his mentorship and contributions to archosaur cranial anatomy that enabled the identification and interpretation of the species.Todays crocodiles live in deltas and estuaries, the environments put under the most stress from human activity, Dr. Holliday concluded. By understanding how these animals ancestors became extinct, we can gain insight into how to protect and preserve the ecosystems vital to modern crocodiles."}, {"title": " Study Suggests First Plants Caused Series of Ice Ages", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Feb 1, 2012", "doc": "A team of UK researchers has revealed how the arrival of the first plants 470 million years ago triggered a series of ice ages. The moss Physcomitrella patens In the study, published today in the journal Nature Geoscience, the team attempts to identify the effects that the first land plants had on the climate during the Ordovician Period, ended around 444 million years ago. During this period, the climate gradually cooled, leading to a series of ice ages. It has been previously known that this global cooling was caused by a dramatic reduction in atmospheric carbon, which this study now suggests was triggered by the arrival of plants. The team used the modern moss, Physcomitrella patens for their study. They placed a number of rocks, with or without moss growing on them, into incubators. Over three months they were able to measure the effects the moss had on the chemical weathering of the rocks. They then used an Earth system model to establish what difference plants could have made to climate change during the Ordovician Period. The findings show that the first plants, the ancestors of mosses, extracted minerals such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and iron from rocks in order to grow. In so doing, they caused chemical weathering of the surface of Earth. This had a dramatic impact on the global carbon cycle and subsequently on the climate. This study demonstrates the powerful effects that plants have on our climate, said Professor Timothy Lenton of the University of Exeter, a co author on the study. Although plants are still cooling the Earths climate by reducing atmospheric carbon levels, they cannot keep up with the speed of todays human induced climate change. In fact, it would take millions of years for plants to remove current carbon emissions from the atmosphere. The study also suggests that the first plants caused the weathering of calcium and magnesium ions from silicate rocks, such as granite, in a process that removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, forming new carbonate rocks in the ocean. This cooled global temperatures by around 5 oC.For me the most important take home message is that the invasion of the land by plants  a pivotal time in the history of the planet  brought about huge climate changes, said Professor Liam Dolan of Oxford University, a co author on the study. Our discovery emphasizes that plants have a central regulatory role in the control of climate they did yesterday, they do today and they certainly will in the future."}, {"title": " New Long-Tailed Pterosaur Discovered in China", "author": "Sergio Prostak", "date": "Jan 20, 2012", "doc": "An international team of paleontologists led by Dr. Junchang\u00a0L\u00fc from Institute of Geology, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, has announced the discovery of a new species of long tailed pterosaur.

The specimen is largely preserved in articulation and was likely complete when found, but appears to have lost the distal portion of the tail during collection, Dr.\u00a0L\u00fc and his co authors wrote in the paper. The species is named in honor of Chen Guo, who found the fossil remains in the Jurassic Tiaojishan Formation of Mutoudeng in Qinglong County, Hebei Province, China, and offered them for scientific research. The name of the genus refers to Qinglong, the Chinese administrative unit, where the species was discovered. The holotype and only known specimen has an estimated forelimb length of 0.18 m. The new taxon is distinguished by a relatively short skull, a remarkably short pteroid with a distinctive knob like distal expansion, and a prepubis with a relatively slender distal process.

In the study, published in the journal Geology, a team of researchers from the University of Calgary hypothesizes a link between the end Permian mass extinction and the high levels of mercury released into the environment during catastrophic Siberian Traps volcanic eruptions. End Permian Earth Christine Daniloff No one had ever looked to see if mercury was a potential culprit. This was a time of the greatest volcanic activity in Earths history and we know today that the largest source of mercury comes from volcanic eruptions, said Dr. Steve Grasby, adjunct professor at the University of Calgary and research scientist at Natural Resources Canada. The researchers found anomalously high levels of mercury in sediments of the High Arctic, Canada, formed during the end of the Permian some 252 million years ago.

Geologists, including myself should be taking notes and taking another look at the other five big extinction events. Typically, algae acts like a scavenger and buries the mercury in the sediment, mitigating the effect in the oceans, explained lead author Dr. Hamed Sanei, adjunct professor at the University of Calgary and research scientist at Natural Resources Canada. But in this case, the load was just so huge that it could not stop the damage. The mercury deposition rates could have been significantly higher in the late Permian when compared with todays human caused emissions. In some cases, levels of mercury in the late Permian ocean was similar to what is found near highly contaminated ponds near smelters, where the aquatic system is severely damaged, said researchers.The story is one of recovery as well. After the system was overloaded and most of life was destroyed, the oceans were still able to self clean and we were able to move on to the next phase of life, concluded Dr. Sanei."}, {"title": " Fossil Crickets and Katydids Hint at the Origins of Insect Hearing", "author": "News Staff / Source", "date": "Jan 5, 2012", "doc": "A team of researchers working at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center has found that some insects such as crickets and katydids evolved their supersensitive hearing long before their predators came to be. 50 million year old fossil cricket Dena Smith A new study of 50 million year old cricket and katydid fossils, published in the January 2012 issue of Journal of Paleontology, helps trace the evolution of the insect ear. Insects hear with help from unusual ears. Grasshoppers have ears on their abdomens. Lacewings have ears on their wings. The ears of the tachinid fly are tucked under the chin. Insects have ears on pretty much every part of their body except on their head proper, said Dr. Roy Plotnick of the University of Illinois, a co author on the study. Insects have evolved ears at least 17 times in different lineages. Dr. Plotnick and his co author Dr. Dena Smith of the University of Colorado are trying to figure out when different insects got their ears, and whether predators may have played a role. Fossil cricket ear it appears as a light colored oval on the front leg Roy Plotnick Modern insects use their ears to tune in to each others chirps, trills and peeps. Many species can also pick up sounds beyond the range of human hearing, such as the high pitched sonar of night hunting bats. Crickets, moths and other flying insects have ultrasound sensitive hearing and can hear bats coming, diving or swerving in midflight to avoid being eaten. The big evolutionary trigger for the appearance of hearing in many insects is thought to be the appearance of bats. Prior to the evolution of bats we would expect to find ears in relatively few insects, but after that we should see ears in more insect groups, Dr. Plotnick said. For this study, the researchers examined fossils from a Green River site in Colorado, focusing on crickets and katydids, which have ears on their front legs, just below their knees. They scoured more than 500 museum drawers of Green River fossils for crickets and katydids with intact front legs, looking for evidence of ears. You can just make them out with the naked eye, Dr. Plotnick explained. They look like the eye of a needle. In crickets and katydids living today, the ear is a tiny oval cavity with a thin membrane stretched over it that vibrates in response to sound, much like our own eardrum. The fossil ears measured half a millimeter in length, and were virtually identical in size, shape, and position to their modern counterparts. The findings suggest that this group of insects evolved their supersensitive hearing long before bat predators came to be.Their bat detecting abilities may have simply become apparent later.

The researchers, including Heather King, Neil Shubin and their colleagues at the University of Chicago, studied fin based locomotion in a species of African lung\ufb01sh Protopterus annectens, elongated eel like fish of about 100 cm long. This species has thread like pectoral and pelvic fins and can either swim like eels or crawl along the bottom using its fins.

About 95 percent of marine life and 70 percent of terrestrial life became extinct during what is known as the end Permian, a time when continents were all one land mass called Pangea.

Ciliates is a vast group of microorganisms that share a common morphology single celled blobs covered in tiny hairs, or cilia. The remains are more than 100 million years older than any previously identified ciliate fossils, and the researchers say the discovery suggests early life on Earth may have been more complex than previously thought. A confocal micrograph image of a ciliate fossil Tanja Bosak These massive changes in biology and chemistry during this time led to the evolution of animals, says Tanja Bosak, the Cecil and Ida Green Career Development Assistant Professor in MITs Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences. We dont know how fast these changes occurred, and now we are finding evidence of an increase in complexity. The group discovered the fossils in rocks from southwestern Mongolia. In 2008, Francis Macdonald, an assistant professor of geology at Harvard and the papers co author, hiked through the Tsagaan Oloom Formation, a rocky terrain full of glacial deposits. These deposits are remnants from the two most severe ice ages, or Snowball Earth events, during the Cryogenian period. Relatively few fossils have been found from this time, making it difficult for geologists to pinpoint exactly what lived during this period. Macdonald brought rock samples back to Cambridge, where Bosak and her colleagues began a meticulous hunt for tiny fossils. The team dissolved sections of rock in acid, then combed through the residue, looking for interesting shapes under the microscope. The team soon uncovered hundreds of beautifully preserved fossils resembling miniature flasks, Bosak says, with constricted necks and flaring collars. Each fossil was covered in bubble like structures. Bosak compared the fossils with modern organisms, finding a nearly perfect match in a group of ciliates called tintinnids. Unlike most ciliates, tintinnids have a tough, vase like shell thats both resistant and flexible. A tintinnid lives within this shell, reaching out through the opening with hair like appendages to draw food in. The bubbles on the shells surface serve as flotation devices, keeping the microbe afloat as its cilia propel it through water. Because of their thick shells, tintinnids are rare ciliates that fossilize. While most unprotected ciliates simply dissolve away, the resistant organic shells of tintinnids can sink to the ocean bottom. Bosak says its this deposition of carbon that may have contributed to the evolution of the first animals. You have this resistant material that sinks to anaerobic oceans, where it takes longer to degrade, Bosak says. As a result, you could sequester more carbon  that in turn releases more oxygen. Nicholas Butterfield, a lecturer in paleobiology at the University of Cambridge in the U.K., says the groups findings provide convincing evidence for ancient organisms that are significantly similar to modern ciliates. However, in his view, the fossils mark a minimum date for the evolutionary appearance of tintinnids  the hairy organisms could have been floating about hundreds of millions of years earlier.Its conceivable that they only evolved, or became ecologically important, at this time, says Butterfield, who was not involved in the research. Ciliates probably do play an important role in how the oceans work, but theres no reason to believe that that role wasnt defined much earlier."}, {"title": " Gigantopithecus Diet Revealed", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "Nov 15, 2011", "doc": "The extinct giant ape, Gigantopithecus blacki, is a species of large hominoids that dominated the Pleistocene of South China. Its massive mandible, large postcanine teeth and extremely thick enamel always spark peoples curiosity about what a diet for this giant ape was. The precise diet and habitat of Gigantopithecus remains unknown so far. Gigantopithecus blacki herd University of Minnesota Duluth The only known fossils of Gigantopithecus blacki are a few teeth and mandibles found in cave sites in Southeast Asia. As the name suggests, they were larger than gorillas,\u00a0 standing up to 3 metres 9.8 ft and weighing up to 540 kilograms 1,200 lb.\u00a0 Dating methods have shown that Gigantopithecus blacki existed for about a million years, going extinct about 100,000 years ago after having been contemporary with Homo sapiens for tens of thousands of years. According to a press release from Chinese Academy of Sciences, researchers from Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology and Institute of Geology and Geophysics, China, analyzed enamel stable carbon isotope values of Gigantopithecus blacki and the associated mammalian megafauna from two sites in South China, and found that this giant ape and other large mammals solely fed on C3 biomass, and lived in forest habitats. Dr. LingXia Zhao of Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology and her collaborators prepared and analyzed 32 tooth samples for their study. Four teeth of Gigantopithecus blacki and 24 teeth of associated large mammals were from Longgudong Cave, Jianshi, Hubei province, and the other 4 teeth of Gigantopithecus blacki were taken from Juyuandong Cave of Liucheng, Guangxi province. It is clear that Gigantopithecus and the affiliated megafauna, such as browsers Cervus sp. and Tapirus sinensis, grazers Equus sp. and Leptobos sp. and carnivores Pachycrocuta licenti and Ursus sp., all derived their carbon from solely C3 biomass sources. Researchers suggested that Gigantopithecus should live in closed forest habitat and not an open habitat, which is consistent with the associated faunal and floral analyses. Analysis of stable carbon isotopes is a powerful method for exploring the diet and habitat use of extinct herbivorous mammals, and it has been used in paleoanthropology in analysis on early hominins fossils. This method is based on the fact that the carbon isotope composition is significantly different between plants that use different photosynthetic pathways, such as C3 plants and C4 plants, and the stable carbon isotope composition of enamel is dependent on the diet components throughout the food chain, said Dr. Zhao.The diet and habitat of Gigantopithecus blacki was significantly different from that of early hominins in Africa, such as Australopithecus and Paranthropus, which could consume both C3 and C4 resources and live in open habitats, although they all somehow show similar powerful mastication morphology .

Snaggle toothed ichthyosaurs larger than school buses swam at the top of the Triassic Period ocean food chain, or so it seemed before Mount Holyoke College paleontologist Mark McMenamin took a look at some of their remains in Nevada. Now he thinks there was an even larger and more cunning sea monster that preyed on ichthyosaurs a kraken of such mythological proportions it would have sent Captain Nemo running for dry land. Shonisaur vertebral disks Geological Society of America The evidence is at Berlin Ichthyosaur State Park in Nevada, where McMenamin and his daughter spent a few days this summer. Its a site where the remains of nine 45 foot 14 meter ichthyosaurs, of the species Shonisaurus popularis can be found. These were the Triassics counterpart to todays predatory giant squid eating sperm whales. I was aware that anytime there is controversy about depth, there is probably something interesting going on, McMenamin said. And when they arrived at the remote state park and started looking at the fossils, McMenamin was struck by their strangeness. It became very clear that something very odd was going on there, said McMenamin. It was a very odd configuration of bones. First of all, the different degrees of etching on the bones suggested that the shonisaurs were not all killed and buried at the same time. It also looked like the bones had been purposefully rearranged. That it got him thinking about a particular modern predator that is known for just this sort of intelligent manipulation of bones. Modern octopus will do this, McMenamin said. What if there was an ancient, very large sort of octopus, like the kraken of mythology. I think that these things were captured by the kraken and taken to the midden and the cephalopod would take them apart. In the fossil bed, some of the shonisaur vertebral disks are arranged in curious linear patterns with almost geometric regularity, McMenamin explained.The proposed Triassic kraken, which could have been the most intelligent invertebrate ever, arranged the vertebral discs in double line patterns, with individual pieces nesting in a fitted fashion as if they were part of a puzzle. Even more creepy The arranged vertebrae resemble the pattern of sucker discs on a cephalopod tentacle, with each vertebra strongly resembling a coleoid sucker. In other words, the vertebral disc pavement seen at the state park may represent the earliest known self portrait. But could an octopus really have taken out such huge swimming predatory reptiles? No one would have believed such a tale until the staff of the Seattle Aquarium set up a video camera at night a few years ago to find out what was killing the sharks in one of their large tanks. What they were shocked to discover was that a large octopus they had in the same tank was the culprit. The video of one of these attacks is available on the web to anyone who uses the search terms shark vs octopus. We think that this cephalopod in the Triassic was doing the same thing, said McMenamin. Among the evidences of the kraken attacks are many more ribs broken in the shonisaur fossils than would seem accidental and the twisted necks of the ichthyosaurs.\u00a0 It was either drowning them or breaking their necks. Of course, its the perfect Triassic crime because octopuses are mostly soft bodied and dont fossilize well. Only their beaks, or mouth parts, are hard and the chances of those being preserved nearby are very low. That means the evidence for the murderous Kraken is circumstantial, which may leave some scientists rather skeptical. But McMenamin is not worried.Were ready for this, he said.

The creature probably grew to about 5 or 6 feet long and had a wide head with small eyes and robust jaws lined with large piercing teeth. Laccognathus embryi Jason PooleANSP I wouldnt want to be wading or swimming in waters where this animal lurked, said Daeschler, co author of the paper and the Academys curator of vertebrate zoology. Clearly these Late Devonian ecosystems were vicious places, and Laccognathus filled the niche of a large, bottom dwelling, sit and wait predator with a powerful bite. The researchers named the new species in honor of Dr. Ashton Embry, a Canadian geologist whose work in the Arctic islands paved the way for the authors paleontological explorations. The kind of fish known as Laccognathus translates as pitted jaw was previously only known from Eastern Europe. The discovery of Laccognathus embryi, the new species, extends the geographic range of Laccognathus to North America and confirms direct connection of the North American and European landmasses during the Devonian Period.This study is the culmination of a lot of work in the field, in the fossil lab, and in the office, said Downs, lead author of the study. Downs, an Academy research associate and a visiting professor at Swarthmore College, started studying fossils in high school as an Academy volunteer. Our team collected the first fossils of Laccognathus almost 10 years ago, and the collection has grown with each subsequent field season. The quality and quantity of this collection will continue to shed new light on these unusual animals."}, {"title": " Early Cretaceous Birds with Crops Found", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "Sep 7, 2011", "doc": "Scientists from Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Tianyu Museum of Nature in Shandong Province, China, and University of Kansas discovered early fossil evidence for the presence of a crop in birds, according to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The crop is characteristic of seed eating birds today, yet little is known about its early history despite remarkable discoveries of many Mesozoic seed eating birds in the past decade. Two Early Cretaceous birds, the basal ornithurine Hongshanornis and a basal avian Sapeornis, demonstrate that an essentially modern avian digestive system formed early in avian evolution. Sapeornis chaoyangensis Lida Xing  Yi Liu In modern seed eating birds the crop provides storage, so that a number of seeds can be gathered quickly and then processed later in a more secure location without interference from competitors or predators. The mucus in the crop softens hard seeds so that they are more easily ground by the gizzard. The gizzard may be a more basal feature for birds, because it is widely distributed in sister groups, such as modern crocodilians. In recent birds the gizzard is posterior to the proventriculus or glandular part of the stomach. The practice of collecting large numbers of small stones in the gizzard is characteristic of seed eaters among modern birds and is often correlated with a well developed crop. In extant birds a crop is a ventral pouch of the esophagus and is situated anterior to the shoulder girdle just in front of the furcula. In fossils its position is indicated by a roughly spherical mass of seeds that is easily discriminated from stomach contents by its location outside of the ribcage. Despite the discoveries of more than 30 genera of fossil birds from the Early Cretaceous lacustrine deposits in Northeastern China and many examples of dietary adaptations, it remains unknown whether a crop was present in these birds. Recently we examined hundreds of Early Cretaceous birds housed at the Tianyu Museum of Nature in Shandong Province, China, and found several specimens belonging to two taxa with unequivocal evidence of crops, said Zheng Xiaoting, lead author and director of Shandong Tianyu Museum of Nature, China, One of them is Sapeornis, one of the basal birds presumed to have an herbivorous diet, and the second taxon is the basal ornithurine Hongshanornis. Both have preserved seeds in the anatomical location of the crop in extant birds. In some cases, even the soft tissue outline of the crop can be observed and resembles closely the structure in modern birds.The discovery of a crop in two phylogenetically remote lineages of Early Cretaceous birds and its absence in most intervening forms indicates that it was independently acquired as a specialized seed eating adaptation."}, {"title": " Tibet: a Homeland for Ice Age Giants", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "Sep 2, 2011", "doc": "The extinction of Ice Age giants such as woolly mammoths, woolly rhinos, giant sloths and saber toothed cats has been widely studied, but much less is known about where these giants came from. The discovery of a primitive woolly rhino fossil in Tibet suggests that some giant mammals first evolved there before the beginning of the Ice Age. The finding is published in this weeks issue of the journal Science. Artists reconstruction of Tibetan woolly rhino Julie Naylor A team of geologists and paleontologists led by Xiaoming Wang from the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and Qiang Li of Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, uncovered a complete skull and lower jaw of a new species of woolly rhino Coelodonta thibetana. The find happened in the foothills of the Himalayas in the southwestern Tibetan Plateau. Cold places, such as Tibet and the Arctic and Antarctic, are where the most unexpected discoveries will be made in the future  these are the remaining frontiers that are still largely unexplored, said Wang. The new rhino is 3.6 million years old, much older and more primitive than its Ice Age descendants in the mammoth steppes across much of Europe and Asia. The extinct animal had special adaptations for sweeping snow, using its flattened horn to reveal vegetation, a useful behavior for survival in the harsh Tibetan climate. The rhinos lived at a time when global climate was much warmer and the northern continents were free of the massive ice sheets seen in the later Ice Age. The rhino grew accustomed to cold conditions in high elevations, and became pre adapted for the future Ice Age climate. When the Ice Age eventually arrived, the cold loving rhinos simply descended from the high mountains and began to expand throughout northern Asia and Europe. This discovery clarifies the origin of the woolly rhinoceros and perhaps much of the now extinct, cold adapted, large animals that lived in the region of the Himalayas and throughout Eurasia some 2.6 million years ago, said geologist and paleontologist H. Richard Lane of NSFs Division of Earth Sciences. In addition to the new woolly rhino, the paleontologists uncovered extinct species of three toed horse, Tibetan bharal, chiru, snow leopard, badger as well as 23 other kinds of mammals. The fossil assemblage from Tibet offers new insights into the origin of the cold adapted Pleistocene megafauna, which has usually been sought in arctic tundra or in cold steppes elsewhere. The new evidence sets up an alternative scenario the harsh winters of the rising Tibetan Plateau may have provided the initial step toward cold adaptation for several successful members of the late Pleistocene mammoth fauna in Europe, Asia, and to a lesser extent, North America.The Tibetan Plateau may have been another cradle of the Ice Age giants."}, {"title": " New Milestone in Mammal Evolution", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "Aug 31, 2011", "doc": "A well preserved fossil discovered in northeast China provides new information about the earliest ancestors of most of todays mammal species. According to a paper published in the journal Nature, the fossil represents a new milestone in mammal evolution that was reached 35 million years earlier than previously thought. It fills an important gap in the fossil record and helps to calibrate modern, DNA based methods of dating evolution. The paper, by a team of scientists led by Carnegie Museum of Natural History paleontologist Zhe Xi Luo, describes Juramaia sinensis, a small shrew like mammal that lived in China 160 million years ago during the Jurassic. Juramaia hunting insects on a tree fern Mark A. Klinger, Carnegie Museum of Natural History Juramaia is the earliest known fossil of eutheriansthe group that evolved to include all placental mammals, which provide nourishment to unborn young via a placenta. As the earliest known fossil ancestor to placental mammals, Juramaia provides fossil evidence of the date when eutherian mammals diverged from other mammals metatherians whose descendants include marsupials such as kangaroos and monotremes such as the platypus. As Luo explains, Juramaia, from 160 million years ago, is either a great grand aunt or a great grandmother of all placental mammals that are thriving today. The fossil of Juramaia sinensis was discovered in the Liaoning Province in northeast China and examined in Beijing by Luo and collaborators Chong Xi Yuan and Qiang Ji from the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences and Qing Jin Meng from the Beijing Museum of Natural History, where the fossil is stored. The name Juramaia sinensis means Jurassic mother from China. The fossil has an incomplete skull, part of the skeleton, and, remarkably, impressions of residual soft tissues such as hair. Juramaias complete teeth and forepaw bones enable paleontologists to pinpoint that it is closer to living placentals on the mammalian family tree than to the pouched marsupials, such as kangaroos. Understanding the beginning point of placentals is a crucial issue in the study of all mammalian evolution, says Luo. Modern molecular studies, such as DNA based methods, can calculate the timing of evolution by a molecular clock. But the molecular clock needs to be cross checked and tested by the fossil record. Prior to the discovery of Juramaia, the divergence of eutherians from metatherians posed a quandary for evolutionary biologists DNA evidence suggested that eutherians should have shown up earlier in the fossil recordaround 160 million years ago. The oldest known eutherian was Eomaia, dated to 125 million years ago. Eomaia was originally described in 2002 by a team of scientists led by Luo and Carnegie mammalogist John Wible. The discovery of Juramaia provides much earlier fossil evidence to corroborate the DNA findings, filling an important gap in the fossil record of early mammal evolution and helping to establish a new milestone of evolutionary history. These scientists have used the rich fossil mammal record to test evolutionary hypotheses proposed by their colleagues studying living mammals using genetic data, says Chuck Lydeard, program director in the National Science Foundations Division of Environmental Biology. Juramaia also reveals adaptive features that may have helped the eutherian newcomers survive in a tough Jurassic environment. Juramaias forelimbs are adapted for climbing. Since the majority of Jurassic mammals lived exclusively on the ground, the ability to escape to the trees and explore the canopy might have allowed eutherian mammals to exploit an untapped niche.Luo supports this perspective The divergence of eutherian mammals from marsupials eventually led to the placental birth and reproduction that are so crucial for the evolutionary success of placentals. But it is their early adaptation to exploit niches on trees that paved their way toward this success."}, {"title": " 1.9 Million Years of Cooking", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "Aug 23, 2011", "doc": "Harvard researchers have found that practice of processing food through cooking was likely invented by humans early ancestors more than 1.9 million years ago. The research found that processing food through cooking freed up literally hours each day not spent feeding, which includes ingesting, chewing, and swallowing food. That newfound time could be spent on other pursuits, such as hunting to procure higher quality foods, creating tools, and socializing. Homo erectus Yale University The researchers also tracked anatomical changes in ancient human ancestors through time, looking for clues to when cooking might have arisen. The research, detailed in the August 22 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, used statistical analysis and evolutionary trees to estimate how long people should spend feeding each day, based on body size and the evolutionary relationship to modern noncooking relatives, such as chimpanzees. The researchers found that people in theory should spend almost half of their total activity time, 48 percent, feeding. Instead, they spend just about a tenth of that, 4.7 percent of activity time  a difference that presented at least some early ancestors with a gift of time. Zarin Machanda, one of the papers authors and a lecturer on human evolutionary biology, said the rewards from the advent of cooking werent shared equally, however. While men were likely freed up to hunt and pursue other activities, an increased burden of food gathering and preparation was placed on women that equaled the time freed up from chewing. Among the researchers was Richard Wrangham, Ruth Moore Professor of Biological Anthropology, who has long championed the idea that cooking was not merely a way to prepare better tasting food, but rather was an important evolutionary adaptation in humans. Cooking, he argues, not only increased the calories available to ancestors and gave them more time for other activities, but it also sparked physical changes such as a bigger brain and a smaller gut, and social changes centered around the home and hearth. The research team also included Chris Organ, a research associate in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Machanda, and Charles Nunn, associate professor of human evolutionary biology. To answer the question of when cooking arose in human history, they tracked a physical characteristic likely tied to the advent of cooking and eating softer food  molar size  through the remains of 14 human ancestors. Researchers confirmed earlier work, which showed that the drop in molar size that occurred in Homo erectus, in Neanderthals, and in Homo sapiens far outstripped what would be expected by comparing it with other evolutionary changes going in the body. The team found that Homo erectus and Neanderthals spent the same amount of time each day eating as do modern humans. That likely means cooking arose before Homo erectus evolved, 1.9 million years ago.It is not just that we feed differently from other primate species, but that changes in the time we spend feeding have been important to our evolution, Organ said."}, {"title": " Oldest Fossils Discovered", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "Aug 22, 2011", "doc": "The oldest fossil evidence for early life has been discovered in micrometre sized pyrite crystals from the Strelley Pool Formation in Western Australia, according to a team led by David Wacey of the University of Western Australia in Crawley.

More than 25 new specimens of Teilhardina brandti  an extinct primate originally described from a single lower molar  include pieces of upper teeth and ankle bones that show the mammal lived in trees. Its nails allowed the lemur like animal to grasp onto branches and move through the trees with more agility, researchers said. Scientists analyze fossilized teeth of Teilhardina brandti University of Florida If you take all the primates that are alive today, theyre all going to have characteristics that look the same, but unlike people, many of them live in trees, said co author Jonathan Bloch, an associate curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Florida Museum of Natural History on the UF campus. By finding parts of the skeleton of this primitive primate, we are able to test whether nails were present in the common ancestor of the group that includes lemurs, monkeys, and humans  its direct evidence as opposed to speculation. Appearing in the current online edition of the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, the study provides a better understanding of the evolutionary relationships of one of the oldest known modern primates, as well as the time frame and environmental conditions that allowed for the development of nails on all fingers and toes, an exclusive feature among primates. Specimens of T. brandti were collected over the last seven years in northwestern Wyomings Bighorn Basin and represent the earliest North American species from the group of euprimates, also known as true primates. The fossils date to the early Eocene epoch, about 55.8 million years ago, at the same time as a 200,000 year global warming event known as the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum occurred, Bloch said. Mammals evolved to be smaller during that time, when even  and odd toed hoofed mammals, distantly related to modern deer and horses, also first appeared in the fossil record. The appearance of the first modern primates in North America co occurred with the appearance of other modern mammals such as horses, and its all associated with a major global warming event, said co author Stephen Chester, a Yale University doctoral student and research associate at UF. It in part set the stage for what we see today in terms of modern mammalian biodiversity. Less than 6 inches long, T. brandti was omnivorous, Bloch said. While archaic primates mostly had claws, some of the characteristics of modern primates include forward facing eyes, an enlarged brain and nails on all digits. They are the smallest true nails known on record, whether living or fossil, said first author Ken Rose, a professor in the Center for Functional Anatomy  Evolution at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. That certainly doesnt suggest nails developed with larger bodies. Based on the age of the fossils and analyses of Teilhardina species from other parts of the world, researchers were also able to analyze the hypothesis that mammals migrated from Asia into North America. Instead, they likely passed from Asia, through Europe and into North America on high latitude land connections. This research really suggests that we are looking at something extremely close to the species found in Europe and thats of great interest in itself, Rose said. We can show these species were extremely close morphologically in time and found in Europe and Wyoming. During the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum, average temperatures were about 15 degrees Fahrenheit higher than today, and the large variety of mammals found in the fossil record from that time remains a mystery to scientists.The finding of this animal and the concentrated effort of this period of time might be one of those things where the closer you look, the less you know, said Gregg Gunnell, director of the Division of Fossil Primates at the Duke Lemur Center. But any time we have the opportunity to add more morphological information to analyze the relationships of animals to answer these biogeographic questions, we can hopefully get closer and closer to an understanding of what led to this big radiation diversification of primates in the first place."}, {"title": " Polar Dinosaur Tracks Found", "author": "James Freeman", "date": "Aug 10, 2011", "doc": "Paleontologists have discovered a group of more than 20 polar dinosaur tracks on the coast of Victoria, Australia, offering a rare glimpse into animal behavior during the last period of pronounced global warming, about 105 million years ago. The discovery, reported in the journal Alcheringa, is the largest and best collection of polar dinosaur tracks ever found in the Southern Hemisphere. Polar dinosaur tracks Anthony Martin These tracks provide us with a direct indicator of how these dinosaurs were interacting with the polar ecosystems, during an important time in geological history, says Emory paleontologist Anthony Martin, who led the research. Martin is an expert in trace fossils, which include tracks, trails, burrows, cocoons and nests. The three toed tracks are preserved on two sandstone blocks from the Early Cretaceous Period. They appear to belong to three different sizes of small theropods  a group of bipedal, mostly carnivorous dinosaurs whose descendants include modern birds. The research team also included Thomas Rich, from the Museum Victoria, Michael Hall and Patricia Vickers Rich, both from the School of Geosciences at Monash University in Victoria and Gonzalo Vazquez Prokopec, an ecologist and expert in spatial analysis from Emorys Department of Environmental Studies. The tracks were found on the rocky shoreline of remote Milanesia Beach, in Otways National Park. This area, west of Melbourne, is known for energetic surf and rugged coastal cliffs, consisting of layers of sediment accumulated over millions of years. Riddled with fractures and pounded by waves and wind, the cliffs occasionally shed large chunks of rock, such as those containing the dinosaur tracks. One sandstone block has about 15 tracks, including three consecutive footprints made by the smallest of the theropods, estimated to be the size of a chicken. Martin spotted this first known dinosaur trackway of Victoria last June 14, around noon. He was on the lookout, since he had earlier noticed ripple marks and trace fossils of what looked like insect burrows in piles of fallen rock. The ripples and burrows indicate a floodplain, which is the most likely area to find polar dinosaur tracks, Martin explains. The second block containing tracks was spotted about three hours later by Greg Denney, a local volunteer who accompanied Martin and Rich on that days expedition. That block had similar characteristics to the first one, and included eight tracks. The tracks show what appear to be theropods ranging in size from a chicken to a large crane. We believe that the two blocks were from the same rock layer, and the same surface, that the dinosaurs were walking on, Martin says. The small, medium and large tracks may have been made by three different species, Martin says. They could also belong to two genders and a juvenile of one species  a little dinosaur family  but thats purely speculative, he adds. The Victoria Coast marks the seam where Australia was once joined to Antarctica. During that era, about 115 105 million years ago, the dinosaurs roamed in prolonged polar darkness. The Earths average temperature was 68 degrees Fahrenheit  just 10 degrees warmer than today  and the spring thaws would cause torrential flooding in the river valleys.The dinosaur tracks were probably made during the summer, Martin says. The ground would have been frozen in the winter, and in order for the waters to subside so that animals could walk across the floodplain, it would have to be later in the season, he explains."}]}
