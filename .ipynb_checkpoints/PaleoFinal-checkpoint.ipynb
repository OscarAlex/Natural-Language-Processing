down to luck , and beaks may have been some birds ace . by the end of the cretaceous <<<< , beaked birds were already eating a much more varied diet than their toothed relatives . these birds were nt specialized on insects or other animal food , and so they were able to pluck up hard food items like seeds and nuts . and in the aftermath of the extinction , when animal life was severely cut back ----- those hard , persistent little morsels got beaked birds through the hard times . beaked birds were able to feed on the seeds of the destroyed forests and wait out the decades until vegetation began to return . not that beaks guaranteed survival of the impact event . the duck like bird vegavis lived at the end of the cretaceous <<<< and had a beak , yet there s no indication that this avian survived . just having a beak was not enough , tucker says . rather , its that birds with beaks and powerful gizzards capable of crushing tough seeds had an unexpected advantage that increased their
