      "{'geology': [{'title': 'Dinosaurs and Dust', 'author': 'Jim Gibson', 'doc': 'Dinosaur fossils are widespread in Mesozoic sediments, but are absent from the overlying Cenozoic sediments. There is debate over the cause of their extinction. The best-known explanation is that a 10-km  diameter asteroid struck the earth near present-day Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula at a site called Chicxulub. This impact is calculated to have produced a cloud of dust and gases that blocked the sun and caused a severe cooling that killed the dinosaurs. Another explanation for dinosaur extinction is that extensive volcanism of the Deccan Traps in India generated atmospheric gases that caused climate change and killed the dinosaurs. Extensive volcanism has been linked to the end-Permian and end-Triassic mass extinctions, and is considered a likely contributor to the demise of the dinosaurs in the end-Cretaceous mass-extinction. Previous discussions of these two potential mechanisms have focused on fossil patterns and event simulations, but have not attempted to model the link between dinosaur habitat suitability and the relative climatic effects of the volcanism and impact scenarios.This paper compares inferred dinosaur habitat requirements with simulations of the Deccan volcanism and the Chicxulub impact. Simulations show that a solar dimming of >15% would destroy all suitable habitat for dinosaurs and directly cause their extinction.In the simulations, volcanism from the Deccan Traps would not produce changes in climate sufficient to completely destroy the dinosaurs. The extended duration of the volcanism would have produced up to a 5% solar dimming, which could reduce average temperatures by up to about 9.7 oC. This would leave at least some suitable habitat in the tropics where dinosaurs could survive.The Chicxulub asteroid impact would generate large amounts of SO2 and CO2, which would be injected into the atmosphere. In the simulations, SO2 would block the sunlight sufficiently to cause solar dimming of >15%, cooling the atmosphere within five years to temperatures below freezing  for 3-16 years. This would completely destroy all habitat suitable for dinosaurs and cause their extinction. According to these calculations, the impact hypothesis, but not the volcanic hypothesis, is sufficient to explain the extinction.Comment. The global nature of dinosaur extinction calls for an explanation that is global in nature. Volcanism and extraterrestrial impacts may be part of that explanation, but there are reasons to question the standard scenario of extinction due to impact. A major problem is the selectivity of the extinctions. What kind of event would be catastrophic enough to destroy every dinosaur on earth but leave survivors among the crocodilians, frogs, snakes, birds, mammals, flowering plants, and many other groups? None of these groups would have any chance of surviving 3-16 years of continuous sub-freezing global temperatures as proposed in the paper.Abrupt changes in fossil types occur throughout the fossil record. In five cases, at least 75% of the species in one layer are absent in the overlying layers. These abrupt changes in fossil content are interpreted as mass extinctions. Two of these mark major boundaries in the geologic column. The end-Permian mass extinction marks the boundary between Paleozoic and Mesozoic layers, and the end-Cretaceous mass extinction marks the boundary between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic layers.Controversy surrounds the causes of the “big five” mass extinctions. The three causes most widely discussed are: extraterrestrial impacts, especially for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction; huge volcanic flows ; and sea-level changes. Each of these proposed causes has some support and some problems, and none of them has achieved consensus status.An alternative explanation is that all three factors were involved in the global catastrophe described in Genesis 7-8, In this scenario, mass extinctions, including the one associated with extinction of the dinosaurs, are not discrete events separated by millions of years, but are part of a continuous process of sequential destruction of habitats. Abrupt changes in source areas, perhaps associated with effects of rapid plate subduction, extraterrestrial impacts, or volcanic outflows, could produce the abrupt changes in fossil content commonly interpreted as mass extinctions. Much research remains to be done in order to develop a satisfactory explanation of the geologic column, but advances are being made as more data become available and more scientists analyze the evidence from a biblical viewpoint. Regardless, models that support instantaneous to very rapid mass extinction, such as the impact scenario, fit better with a short chronology approach than models entailing protracted and gradual deterioration of ecosystems over thousands to tens of thousands of years.'}, {'title': 'Rapid Bedrock Incision', 'author': 'Ronny Nalin, Michael Kotulla', 'doc': 'New observational data on the phenomenon of rapid bedrock erosion became recently available after the well documented events that affected the Oroville Dam in February 2017.\\r\\nThe Oroville Dam, located in northern California, USA, confines a large water reservoir  with a retention capacity of about 4 km3. The lake level is controlled through a main spillway, consisting of a concrete chute nearly 1 km long and about 50 m wide that slopes for over 200 vertical meters down to the Feather River . An emergency spillway, designed to be active in cases of extremely high lake levels, is located to the side  of the main spillway, and consists of a linear concrete weir separating the lake waters from the wide valley flank that leads down to the river bed .\\r\\nThe Crisis in February 2017\\nExceptional rainfall in the Winter of 2017 caused significant inflow into the reservoir and required activation of the main spillway to control the lake level. On February 7, an irregular flow behavior was detected in the middle part of the main spillway chute. Water discharge was interrupted to investigate the cause of the anomaly, revealing that the concrete chute was severely damaged over tens of meters. A large section of concrete had been washed away and water had already created an erosional path to the left  of the chute . However, because of increasing lake levels caused by exceptional rainfall, discharge on the damaged spillway was reactivated on February 9, with outflow rates varying between of 1120 and 1820 m3/s. In spite of this renewed outflow, the lake level kept rising, reaching more than 901 feet on the night between February 11 and 12, and causing overflow at the weir of the emergency spillway for the first time in the history of the dam .\\r\\nErosion downhill of the emergency spillway occurred faster and more effectively than expected, with the threat of possible collapse of the weir and consequent catastrophic release of large volumes of water. This risk prompted a mandatory evacuation of the Oroville area , on February 12. Decision makers managing the crisis had to significantly increase the outflow rate at the main spillway (to 2800 m3/s) to bring the lake level below the threshold of the emergency spillway. This would imply further erosion and damage at the main spillway, but it was estimated that the new incision next to the spillway would deepen in a \"controlled\" manner, preventing sheet erosion or another lateral breakout towards the dam. The strategy worked, and on the night between February 12 and 13 the overflow at the weir of the emergency spillway stopped . As the lake level kept decreasing, discharge at the main spillway was also gradually reduced until, on February 27, the outflow was finally halted to begin the subsequent phases of surveying, cleanup, and repair.\\nRemarks and Implications\\nThe extent of erosion attained in just a few days at the main spillway is remarkable. The concrete spillway chute was destroyed and torn away in its middle to lower section. Next to the chute, a canyon was incised, several tens of meters deep and several hundred meters long . Overflow from the emergency spillway removed soil cover and caused significant bedrock incision in just one day .\\r\\nThe bedrock in the area affected by erosion is part of the Jurassic Smartville Complex, and consists of low grade metavolcanics of mafic composition, with sheeted diabase intrusions. The tabular nature of the volcanics and of the subsequent sheeted intrusions confers a distinctively layered aspect to the unit. Layers dip at a relatively high angle to the east, against the slope of the valley . The planar discontinuities of the layering and some fractures favored plucking of blocks as the main mechanism of erosion under solicitation by hydraulic flow, as demonstrated by the abundance of planar faces on the angular blocks in the debris pile and on the jugged surface of the eroded bedrock .\\r\\nWeathered bedrock  is certainly less competent than the fresh lithology , and spatial variations in thickness of this top level might have played a role in determining the points where extensive erosion was initially concentrated. However, significant fresh bedrock erosion took place both at the main spillway and downhill of the emergency spillway .\\r\\nThe debris generated by erosion at the main spillway  accumulated at the foot of the new canyon, rapidly creating a system of coarse-grained, boulder-rich bars at the confluence with the Feather River .\\nAt the beginning of the crisis, there had been fears that the service spillway, initially damaged in its middle section , would be affected by back-stepping erosion and collapse, thus attacking the dam itself. In fact, this happened at first , but most incision seems to have concentrated in the narrowed flow cross-section of the newly cut canyon next to the chute, with relatively minor headward propagation of erosion .\\r\\nThe initial cause of the damage at the main spillway, as well as the extent and mechanisms of subsequent erosion will be thoroughly investigated by engineers and geologists. Here appropriate technical and professional publications are to be expected.\\r\\nThe maximum flow or discharge rate attained in the bedrock incision at the main spillway – 2800 m3/s, reduced by the proportion of water that kept flowing over the chute – is comparable to smaller Icelandic glacial outburst floods , which have rates of 103 to 104 m3/s, and some orders of magnitude lower than a megaflood with rates of ≥ 106 m3/s.\\nThis event of observed erosion provides the rare opportunity to analyze the formation of a canyon and test models used to account for large-scale erosional features of the landscape. After all, the idea is still widespread that deep river canyons  formed over prolonged geologic time by slow and gradual fluvial incision; in contrast, there are observational data that suggest the possibility of canyon formation during high-energy and rapid erosive events. Most importantly, the observation of bedrock erosion and formation of depositional bars over short time scales in a relatively localized area is a powerful miniature representation of what could be expected in the context of non-uniformitarian, large-scale water flows.\\r\\n'}, {'title': 'The Grand Staircase: a Case Study in Scientific Thinking from a Biblical Worldview', 'author': 'Leonard R. Brand', 'doc': ' In Utah and northern Arizona is a unique geological landscape feature, called the Grand Staircase. Imagine a staircase with each step a thousand feet or more high, and many miles wide. That is the Grand Staircase. Each step is a cliff composed of one or more geological formations. The group of formations forming each step begins in Utah and continues to the south until it ends in a cliff. The oldest rocks in this sequence, the Paleozoic rocks seen in the walls of the Grand Canyon, form the lowest step. Each higher step has younger rocks, and its cliff is farther north. The youngest rocks, those forming the highest cliff, don’t extend farther south than the northern part of Utah. How was this staircase formed? A river erodes the land into a valley. The river valley may be deep and narrow, or it may form a wide flood plain, but a river always has a riverbank on each side. The Grand Staircase is like a valley with a riverbank  on only one side. There is much evidence that the Grand Staircase must have been carved out of the landscape, not be rivers, but by a massive, catastrophic flow of water across southwestern United States. THE TASK Previous publications have discussed the concept that a biblical worldview can be applied in ways that suggest scientifically testable hypotheses, and thus lead to productive research. The source of these ideas may come from outside of conventional science, but the ideas and hypotheses can be fully testable by standard scientific research procedures, as exemplified by a number of research projects cited in these references. The following is an example – a case study of what it means to apply that method in geological research.One of the first principles to recognize is that science does not often prove things, and this applies with double force in study of ancient history. Bible believers are often tempted to want proof of creation or the flood. Science does not offer that proof . Valid application of science involves defining hypotheses, and then seeking to test them; to see if these ideas are useful in interpreting the evidence. Of the hypotheses that have been proposed, we want to know which seems to best explain the available evidence.In southern Utah and northern Arizona is a magnificent landscape feature called the Grand Staircase  and we will discuss hypotheses in regard to how this feature was formed. The staircase is a series of giant steps, actually cliffs, dropping down across southern Utah, all the way to the Grand Canyon. At each step a portion of the rock layers forming the geological column ends in a generally southward-facing cliff. The question we will address is what geological processes formed this series of steps? Why do each of these groups of rock formations suddenly end in a cliff?For those who are not geologists we will review several geological processes pertinent to study of the Grand Staircase. Readers who already know the basic geology may wish to skip down to the heading “Methods of Study of the Grand Staircase.”Each rock formation was formed when sediment, such as sand, mud, or pebbles was carried, usually by water, and deposited in a sedimentary layer, or calcium carbonate was precipitated to form limestone. A “formation” is a discrete unit of rock with identifiable characteristics that can be traced and mapped over a recognizable geographic region. Some formations are uniform in composition, e.g., sandstone , or mudstone , but more often they are a combination of more than one type of sediment. These are deposited one formation above the other, with each formation accumulating through some unit of time. The entire set of formations forms the layer cake structure called the geological column . A representative sample of the geological column can be seen in Utah and Arizona.The Grand Canyon was carved through Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks. Those Paleozoic formations extend to the north, under the several formations in southern Utah forming the Triassic portion of the regional sequence of layers . These Paleozoic and Triassic formations, or equivalent formations, extend to the north under the Jurassic and Cretaceous formations. Together, the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous form what is known as the Mesozoic part of the sequence of layers. Farther north there are Cenozoic formations on top of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic rock formations. This entire series of formations composes a time-sequence, like a history book; the lower layers are the oldest, and the upper layers are sequentially younger. This chronological sequence is real, whether one believes it formed in a few thousand years, or in hundreds of millions of years.After these formations were deposited, they were at some time eroded to form the landscape we now see. The features of our landscape always have a geological reason for their characteristics. For example, sandstones and limestones are quite resistant to erosion, and typically erode into cliffs, while softer rocks like mudstone or shale erode into softer hills, slopes and valleys. This landscape-shaping erosion occurs largely through the energy of flowing water, such as streams, rivers, ocean waves, or ocean currents.Ocean waves cut their way through the rock along the shore, moving the shoreline back, and sometimes taking our prime shorefront real estate with them. Rivers carve channels, with a river bank on each side of the channel.Notice that a river leaves a bank, or cliff, on each side of the river channel. We seldom see truly catastrophic water erosion, but experiments and a few geological features indicate the unimaginable power of water moving rapidly on a large scale. As water erodes the landscape it may carve cliffs, with a more erosion-resistant layer forming the cliff, or at least the top of the cliff.In conventional geological theory the major share of erosion through geological history occurred by processes we can observe on the earth today, whereas a biblical worldview implies that some significant portion of erosion events included erosion on a catastrophic scale far beyond our experience. Conventional scientists use their naturalistic paradigm as a basis for developing hypotheses, and a biblical worldview can be used the same way . With these concepts in mind, let us return to the Grand Staircase.METHODS OF STUDY OF THE GRAND STAIRCASE The first step in this project was to find what is known of the geology of the Grand Staircase. Geological maps provided basic information on the rock formations involved, and the nature of their exposure across the Staircase. Other literature on these formations was studied and much travel through Arizona and Utah over several decades provided personal acquaintance with the geology of the region. With this background in mind, the next step was to photograph the geological maps of Utah and Arizona and enter these photographs into Adobe Illustrator. Then color overlays were made, forming bands of color corresponding to the distribution of specific rock formation outcrops across the landscape. Each color band shows the distribution of the set of rock formations composing one of the steps in the Grand Staircase .THE GRAND STAIRCASE The lowest step includes primarily the Paleozoic in the walls of the Grand Canyon, with the Kaibab Limestone forming the top of the cliff.The next step is called the Chocolate Cliffs . The top of this cliff is formed by the erosion-resistant Shinarump Conglomerate. Above that, several red Triassic formations make up the Vermillion Cliffs. The next cliff, the White Cliffs is formed by the Triassic/Jurassic Navajo Sandstone . The Navajo Sandstone in this cliff is primarily white, but in other places it is red, forming part of what is locally called the red-rock country in Utah. The Grey Cliffs are Cretaceous grey shales and other relatively soft rocks. Consequently the Grey Cliffs are not as sharply defined as the other cliffs. Above the Cretaceous Grey Cliffs comes the Cenozoic Claron Formation in the Pink Cliffs.The sequence of cliffs shown in . These are shown in the photographs in . The question we are pursuing is how did this staircase form? What type of water action would be expected to carve such a series of steps?HOW DID THE STAIRCASE FORM? Our first question is whether the steps are primarily the result of erosion of formerly widespread deposits as usually interpreted, or whether these rock formations were originally deposited only where they now appear, with each set of formations only deposited part way south through Utah. If the latter was the case it could explain why the formations did not go farther south, but ended at different places along the way. If they were deposited that way we would expect the formations to get thinner toward the south, until they pinch out, as in .But they are not like that. Some formations get a little thinner, but others get thicker toward the south. The overall effect is not a thinning toward the south, as would be expected if they were not deposited farther south. Each group of formations just continues until they end in a cliff as in . South of each cliff face they were eroded away. The evidence indicates they must have continued much farther south before they were eroded back to where the cliff now is. The dotted lines in . How does that type of erosion happen?We will come back to that question, but first consider what is the size of this staircase feature. .Much of this territory is included in Grand Staircase National Monument. However, the Grand Canyon is just a giant gash across an uplifted part of the landscape, and the same Paleozoic formations continue south  until they end at the lowest step in the staircase – the Mogollon Rim in central Arizona. .In reality there is even more to the Grand Staircase. If we follow the upper cliffs indicated by the colored bands, they go north and then to the east through northern Utah. Above them are two more levels of rock formations, the Uinta and Green River Formations . The Grand Staircase actually is a series of cliffs, one above the other, beginning in northern Utah and dropping down, one step at a time, all the way to the Mogollon Rim across central Arizona, and this staircase also extends into part of western Colorado . This area includes most of what is called the Colorado Plateau.This northern part of the picture does not appear to be quite as clear, because of irregular features in central Utah that complicate the nature of the steps. These include the San Rafael Swell, the Circle Cliffs, and the Teasdale Uplift. But these are not as disruptive to the staircase pattern as they may appear at first. These features are just uplifted areas, like bubbles, that pushed the rock formations up, accompanied by erosion that removed the central areas of each bubble. If we could just flatten these out – iron out the wrinkles in the landscape – the picture would be clearer. Fortunately we can do that with the help of Adobe Illustrator, as in .Without these wrinkles the steps go consistently up as we proceed north, to the upper step in northern Utah, with the middle Mesozoic red rock country extending through the central area of Utah. There are also several mesas composed of remnants of Cretaceous rocks that were not removed by erosion.PROPOSING AND TESTING HYPOTHESES Conventional thought among geologists generally follows the philosophy of Methodological Naturalism, and uses that as a basis for developing hypotheses to explain the phenomena they are studying. Can we use our biblical worldview in the same way, as a basis for developing hypotheses to explain, e.g., the erosion of Utah and Arizona to form the Grand Staircase? Our logic can be clarified if we follow Chamberlain’s recommendation of multiple working hypotheses, and define two or more hypotheses for the shaping of the Grand Staircase, basing some on the concepts of conventional geology and others on a biblical view of earth history. Then our research can seek to open-mindedly compare the hypotheses, and search for data with the potential to test between them. That is a valid and constructive approach to a scientific question. There is another side to that. As Thomas Kuhn suggests, a new idea, no matter how good it is, may never have a fair chance to succeed unless a few persons believe in it enough to diligently seek to develop and apply it in their research. So let us do what he suggests, and proceed with these hypotheses.1. Landscape formation, including the Grand Staircase, in one catastrophe, at end of a global flood.2. Series of such catastrophic erosion events, at end of the flood.3. One catastrophe later, possibly in association with glaciation.4. A series of such catastrophic erosion events, perhaps in association\\xa0with glaciation rather than at the end of the global flood.5. Erosion by fluvial processes  and rain, as occurs today,\\xa0over ~ 5 million years.6. Erosion by fluvial processes, somewhat more extreme than normal,\\xa0but still over millions of years.For our purposes we can simplify these into two working hypotheses:Working hypothesis one : the erosion of the Grand Staircase occurred by processes similar to those we observe today, over millions of years. Since this erosion occurred sometime after the Green River Formation was deposited, there was no ocean in Utah at that time. There was the enormous Lake Bonneville, which drained catastrophically, but that is to the west of our study area. So the erosion of the Grand Staircase would have to be the result of fluvial  processes. But there is a significant problem with that explanation. A river cuts a channel or a wider flood plain with a bank on each side , and does not carve a series of steps as in the Grand Staircase.Thus river erosion does not seem to be a likely process for carving the steps. This conclusion is supported if we add the primary river drainages to the map . The rivers do not follow the steps in any way that seems likely to have cut the steps. In fact in a number of cases the river drainages cut right across the large landscape features.However, we must consider this possibility carefully. It could be suggested that river erosion formed the staircase pattern as the Colorado Plateau region was gradually uplifted. The first proposed step in this process would occur after a partial uplift of the region. Rivers then meandered widely across the landscape, according to this explanation, eroding much of the region down to a stable base level. Then several hundred feet of further uplift resulted in a somewhat smaller region again being eroded down to a new stable base level. If this happened several times, it could be proposed, this could result in the staircase as we see it now. If this occurred, it would involve meandering rivers fairly uniformly eroding several thousand square miles at each step in the process, followed by an episode of uplift and then a repeat of the erosion process. Is this repetitive uplift and erosion process likely? Can we find evidence of these meandering river systems in the plateaus of the Grand Staircase? There is a paper describing one Miocene river in northern Arizona that is no longer a river. Is there evidence for the multitude of such paleodrainages that would be required to form the Staircase?There is another significant challenge for this scenario. The process would have to erode away any evidence of the southern “bank” of the river valley or flood plain where this occurred, leaving only the south-facing cliffs that would have formed the northern bank of the system. Is there any evidence, or a likely hypothesis for the disappearance of the southern flank of such an ancient river system? This scenario must be considered, but I suggest that the evidence presented here suggests that a different process is required to explain the Grand Staircase./ Arizona landscape to look like if it was eroded by fluvial  processes. If the Grand Staircase had been carved by river systems there should be an evident relationship between the rivers and the shape of the landscape, but the actual cliffs do not show such a relationship to the existing river systems. The evidence we have looked at does not seem consistent with working hypothesis one – forming the cliffs by river erosion, as it occurs in the modern world.. The drainage on top of the mesa is toward the south .There are wide valleys there with dendritic drainage patterns within each of these valleys. They don’t drain over the northern edge of the mesa, but drain to the south. If we look at the mesa wall from the northeast  these valleys appear as hanging valleys .It appears as if the valleys were formed before the rock formations forming the mesa were eroded away from the area north of the mesa. Then the drainages on top of the mesa continued to drain to the south. This also is consistent with the other evidence discussed above, that questions whether river-related processes provide adequate explanations for the origin of these landscape features.Now consider working hypothesis two : The rock formations covered Utah and northern Arizona as indicated by the dotted lines in . Then catastrophic water flow  on a massive geographic scale flowed over the Colorado Plateau with the energy and erosive processes to rapidly erode back the formations, moving the cliffs or scarps back to the north, one after the other . If the water flowed from the north, headward erosion began cutting at the south, proceeding back to the north, with the southern area eroded more deeply to form the lowest of the steps. Or the erosion could have followed a different pattern, but whatever the specific pattern, the Grand Staircase was cut into the landscape by one or more of these catastrophic events. If this occurred, careful research may possibly find evidence for the direction and pattern of water flow that produced the existing landscape.The hypothesis that best fits the evidence is large-scale water flow that shapes the landscape features, often cutting channels across these features, and rivers only cut the final touches into the landscape , as in . In this hypothesis the southward drainage system on Black Mesa was established when the mesa still extended farther to the north. I propose that the catastrophic erosion removed the former northern extension of the mesa, leaving the hanging valleys as remnants of the original drainage pattern.The southern edge of the series of cliffs in the Grand Staircase is very irregular. Is this contrary to the explanation I am suggesting? Was the erosion of the steps controlled by structural features like faults and folds? There is a series of faults and folds that are a prominent feature of southern Utah geology. However, these features are all north-south trending geological structural features, as shown in cross-section in .In the western part of the staircase are three major north-south faults, and in each case the sediments are raised up on the east side of the fault. Then farther east from these are three prominent monoclines, which in each case are folded up toward the west. These dramatic features are shown in . Since they are oriented north-south, they could not be the cause of the staircase, but actually cut across the steps in the staircase. The faults and folds are irrelevant to the origin of the staircase pattern. The staircase cliffs have only been shifted in north-south directions by these structural features, but not formed by them.On the east side of the Cockscomb monocline the Triassic and Jurassic formations that make the cliffs to the west have gone underground, but the cliff topography continues to the east as two prominent cliffs in the Cretaceous formations. The lower of these cliffs is continuous with, and contains the same rock formations as the Straight Cliffs on the east side of that area . It can be suggested that the same large-scale water flow that formed the Grand Staircase also carried the cliff pattern across these Cretaceous formations.AN ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION Another explanation for the cliffs of the Grand Staircase is presented by Schmidt.6 Using geological observations in the Colorado Plateau he concludes that each of the steps has eroded back  at rates of 1 to 9 kilometers per million years. He bases this on careful logic and observations, so it cannot be just brushed off. However, his conclusion is based on, and dependent on two assumptions that are not directly stated in the paper, but are clear from his presentation of data and interpretations. One assumption is that the scarp retreat process occurred through processes consistent with what is generally active today . But the evidence I have presented above raises doubts about the adequacy of these modern fluvial processes to explain the origin of the enormous staircase-like series of cliffs, which drop down consistently in one direction.The other assumption is his acceptance of the radiometric time scale, which is the basis for his time calculations. That time scale is not consistent with a Bible-based worldview, but there is nothing in my analysis of the staircase phenomenon that can address the time issue. If we leave aside for now the question of time, the physical evidence described above still strongly suggests that his model is not adequate to explain the evidence, no matter what the time scale.How could Schmidt and his colleagues be so wrong? Are they practicing careless science? I see no evidence of that. The existence of two such radically different models for formation of the Grand Staircase can only be understood if we consider the dominant role of worldviews in our approach to such scientific questions. If a geologist is fully convinced that the conventional, naturalistic explanation of earth history is correct and the only viable scientific approach , that philosophy rules their scientific thinking on the big questions of history. To consider the possibility that biblical catastrophism could suggest explanations worth a second thought is not generally going to happen. Only someone with personal confidence that the God of the Bible knows more about geology than we do will take seriously a geological model that is initiated or encouraged by a biblical worldview. Even if such a model is absolutely correct, it will not succeed unless there are logically thinking, properly educated persons with the determination to develop the model and apply it in research. Have I proved my conclusions about the origin of the Grand Staircase? No, certainly not, but I predict that working hypothesis two will be found to be going in the right direction, and clearly is most consistent with the data. Even though our discussion of the origin of the Grand Staircase arose from a religious perspective, it resulted in these testable hypotheses – testable by careful study of the geomorphological evidence. I suggest that this project illustrates how a biblical worldview can be an effective platform for scientific thinking and hypothesis development and testing. An alternate worldview, applied consciously and deliberately as we have done in this project, can lead to constructive, even better hypotheses. I propose that there are many geological or biological questions to which this worldview, applied consciously and deliberately, can lead to better understanding, or at least to deeper testing of the concepts being studied. The hypotheses that we propose may be supported by such research, or the research may lead to better hypotheses that can also be tested. Either way will result in improved scientific understanding, as our alternate hypotheses provide the incentive and some suggestions for further research. W. M. Davis, a prominent geologist encouraged the pursuit of what he called “outrageous hypotheses,” since most really new ideas in geology will seem outrageous at first. He may not have been willing to accept my hypothesis on the Grand Staircase as a legitimate outrageous hypothesis, but I propose that his concept can be appropriately expanded as I am doing.Some individuals may be reticent to approach research in this way, because they have seen some biblically-oriented scientific research that was done in a shallow way. Actually there has been shallow research done on all sides of the philosophical spectrum, so that is not an adequate reason for avoiding a novel approach. Quality research has also been done in all of those quarters. Careful work, testing multiple hypotheses, is essential and will lead us in the right direction.This paper presents a preliminary analysis and suggests hypotheses for testing. This is not a finished conclusion, but proposes an idea that can lead to extensive field geology research, and also experimental modeling, on the question of scarp retreat and the erosional history of the Grand Staircase – an opportunity for productive research that would probably not occur if our biblical worldview did not lead us to think it provides constructive insights. I will not be the person to pursue this research, considering what stage of my career I am in. I hope someone does take up the awesome opportunity for research presented by the Grand Staircase, and seeks better explanations for its origin.'}, {'title': 'What Is the Evidence for a Large Asteroid Impact at the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) Boundary?', 'author': 'Ronny Nalin', 'doc': 'The hypothesis of a large meteorite impacting the surface of the Earth at the end of the Cretaceous was introduced almost four decades ago. In the ensuing years, the geologic community gathered a large body of data in support of this hypothesis, elevating it to the status of a universally accepted fact of Earth history. However, competing models and lively discussions are still unfolding over the dynamics and environmental consequences of this large impact. This short article attempts to a) summarize the evidence that led to the acceptance of the hypothesis; b) assess current areas of uncertainty related to the impact hypothesis; and c) consider ways in which this event is relevant for creationist thinking.History of the hypothesis and geologic evidenceThe original physical evidence that led Alvarez et al. to suggest the impact hypothesis was an anomalously high content of the heavy element iridium in thin clay deposits stratigraphically placed at the so-called K-Pg boundary , the contact between Cretaceous and Paleogene rocks. Iridium is much more abundant in meteorites than in the rocks of Earth’s crust. Therefore, Alvarez et al. concluded that all the extra iridium found in the clay boundary layer must have come from the impact of a large extraterrestrial bolide, the dust of which settled after being projected and dispersed through the Earth’s atmosphere. The theory gained strength because the iridium anomaly was detected at the K-Pg boundary in many localities around the globe, a prediction of the impact hypothesis. It was also noted that K-Pg boundary clays were enriched not only in iridium but also in other noble metals more abundant in meteorites than on Earth’s crust. Furthermore, numerous tiny spherules of glass and other minerals were discovered in the boundary layer and interpreted as droplets of melt and vaporized rock, ejected after the impact and solidified during fallout. K-Pg boundary deposits were also found to contain shocked grains, which are small mineral granules showing features diagnostic of shock-induced deformation . Such shock features were expected to form in crystals of target rock hit by the impactor and ejected from the crater area. Finally, a surprisingly large amount of soot, a form of elemental carbon produced in the burning of flames, was also detected in some boundary clay deposits, leading to the suggestion that the impact had ignited global wildfires.In their 1980 paper, Alvarez et al. had already made an estimate of the size of the asteroid (~10km), predicting a diameter for the impact crater of about 200 km. However, ten years after the publication of their paper no crater structure had yet been found. It seemed that the thickness of ejecta deposits  decreased away from North-Central America, an area where there was also evidence of tsunami-related deposition thought to have occurred near the impact site. Therefore, the crater had to be located somewhere between North and South America. Eventually, Hildebrand et al. localized a subsurface circular structure in the Yucatán Peninsula  of matching size, expected stratigraphic position , and with the right type of impact-related rocks and deposits to be identified as the impact crater. This structure was given the name of Chicxulub Crater. Finding that the last missing piece of the puzzle fulfilled former predictions helped to settle the case in favor of the impact hypothesis.Developments and open questionsSince its discovery, the Chicxulub Crater has been studied with geophysical methods and wells have been drilled to better characterize the structure and its deposits. It appears that the crater is a multi-ring structure, with large concentric fault systems and tilted blocks around its rim, and a central uplift where deep crust and even upper mantle material was upwarped by several kilometers. Impact-related deposits include impact melt, melt-bearing breccias, and large uplifted blocks of granitic basement with pervasive evidence of shock features. The thickness of these deposits varies, but can reach up to several km within the crater. Uncertainties remain about the specific dynamics that generated the multi-ring structure during the impact, the reason for asymmetries observed in the structure, and the lithology and horizontal and vertical distribution of different impact-related deposits in the crater.The study of the ejecta deposits has also significantly advanced after the discovery of the Chicxulub Crater. Their thickness, composition, and sedimentology seem to correspond well with the location of the impact at Chicxulub. Proximal deposits are thicker  and generally indicative of more energetic deposition, whereas distal deposits are thin  and deposited through settling . Early reports had already suggested the possibility of tsunami-related deposition caused by the impact in proximal areas. However, high-quality geophysical data have revealed the truly astonishing proportions of sedimentation processes triggered by the event. For example, in the Gulf of Mexico, a region close to the impact site, the boundary layer can be very thick  and is traceable all across the basin. It appears to consist of debris flows and turbidites generated by earthquakes and tsunamis, causing significant erosion and resuspension of unconsolidated sediment. Not all the sediment in this boundary deposit, considered the most voluminous event deposit known to date in the geologic record, was derived from the impact crater. A substantial component was sourced from slope instability and erosion of shelf platforms close to the impact site.However, a dissenting interpretation of the ejecta deposits has been strongly advocated by Gerta Keller  and colleagues. This alternative view suggests that some of the deposits usually interpreted as forming rapidly by sediment gravity flows related to the impact formed instead over a prolonged period of time after the impact. Therefore, they do not represent the actual K-Pg boundary. The evidence in support of this view is based on detailed sedimentological and paleontological analyses, showing a more complex picture than usually assumed. It includes the presence of distinct and multiple spherule layers, occurrence of burrowing and sedimentary structures in the boundary deposits requiring a certain amount of time to form, and erosion and reworking at the K-Pg boundary that may impede precise age attribution. If the Chicxulub Crater predates the K-Pg boundary, it could be possible that a different, subsequent impact caused the iridium anomaly, and some possibilities for multiple impact scenarios have been discussed in the literature, although they have not gained much traction. Most importantly, if the impact precedes the K-Pg boundary by a substantial amount of time, it cannot be the direct cause for the remarkable disappearance of many groups of fossils  observed across the boundary. The link between the impact and patterns of extinctions observed in sedimentary layers spanning the K-Pg boundary has always been the most controversial aspect of the hypothesis. Many paleontologists believe that the distribution of different groups of organisms in the layers below and above the K-Pg boundary was not caused by the impact, and favor more gradualistic models of extinction caused by progressive deterioration of environmental conditions, perhaps aggravated by the impact. The most commonly invoked alternative as the cause for mass extinction is large scale volcanism recorded in the Deccan Large Igneous Province , which also spans the K-Pg boundary.Modelling and reconstruction of the environmental effects of the impact is also an area where considerable differences in view have emerged. The original scenario proposed by Alvarez et al.  of ejected dust obscuring the sky for years and shutting down photosynthesis was found to overestimate the dust load in the ejecta plume, but variants of the “impact winter” hypothesis are commonly discussed in the literature. The hypothesis of global wildfires was also reconsidered, because levels of charcoal in the boundary layer are low and soot probably derived from the ignition of organic matter in the target rocks rather than from burning forests. Models also show that the thermal radiation caused by reentry of ejecta particles in the atmosphere was probably not sufficient to cause global wildfires. Other suggested effects in the aftermath of the impact include acid rains and absorption of solar radiation by sulfur aerosols produced by the vaporization of sulfur-bearing sediments in the impact target rocks.Finally, an important focus of research on the impact hypothesis has been the characterization of the type of impactor, based on geochemical signatures left in the ejecta deposits, with the consensus seeming to indicate a carbonaceous chondrite.Implications for creationist thinkingPhilosophical implications: The impact hypothesis has been instrumental in breaking the mold of gradualistic thinking in geology, spurring a new way of looking at geologic data, with renewed openness to and interest in large scale and catastrophic processes. Although this trend had already been signaled by the acceptance of Bretz’s megaflood hypothesis, the exponential growth of publications addressing catastrophes in the Earth systems was certainly favored by a change in the cultural milieu where the impact hypothesis of Alvarez et al. played an important role. Creationist thinking is sympathetic to the development of catastrophic models, because a short chronology requires a great amount of geologic activity to occur over a short amount of time and because the biblical account mentions a short but globally cataclysmic flood. Therefore, creationists have benefited and will continue to benefit from the development of neocatastrophist hypotheses, with increased possibilities for common interests in research projects and collaborations with secular scholars.Geological implications: A first consideration about the impact hypothesis is that its development and corroboration attest to the reliability of the discipline of stratigraphy. It was stratigraphy that led geochemists in their search around the world for a peak in the concentration of iridium, a peak that, in most disparate places, was where the work of stratigraphers had previously located the K-Pg boundary. This impressive example of the power and high resolution of stratigraphic correlation counters the arguments of those who are skeptical about the reliability of stratigraphy and about the value of the geologic column as a framework to spatially organize rock units.Secondly, impact-related processes and deposits are an open window to the remarkable signature of catastrophic events in the rock record and have the potential to revolutionize the gradualistic interpretive approach. In sedimentology, impact-related deposits provide an example of rapid  basin-scale deposition of hundreds of meters of sediment. and basin-scale erosion and remobilization of unconsolidated sediment. In structural geology, crater formation requires extreme rock weakening, to the point of fluidization, offering instructive scenarios for crust and mantle softening that could help model plate tectonic processes within a catastrophist framework. Cratering also offers an example of almost instantaneous formation of faults and tectonic features. In igneous geology, models have shown that large impacts can produce massive amounts of melts almost instantaneously, leading to the suggestion that impacts might even have been responsible for the emplacement of some large igneous provinces. At the same time, not everything in the geologic record of impacts is massive or disruptive. For example, some distal ejecta layers are only mm thin and often found sandwiched in relatively undisturbed fine grained marine deposits. Therefore, impact deposition epitomizes well the formidable complexity of the geologic record. The same event that accounts for hundreds of meters of sediment and complete disruption in one area is expressed elsewhere by a perfectly identifiable thin layer within hundreds of meters of unrelated rocks.Finally, the physical evidence attributed to the impact is a prime example of how the rocks have a story to tell. There are indeed large shocked blocks of basement and tens of meters of breccia in the subsurface of the Yucatán Peninsula, tiny spherules forming thin layers can be found near or at the K-Pg boundary in several locations around the world, and an anomalously high concentration of iridium can be globally detected in a very precise stratigraphic interval. These observations, and many others more, can be placed together in a coherent picture. in spite of all the uncertainties and limitations intrinsic to the practice of historical sciences. The reconstruction of what occurred might not be exactly right in all of its aspects, but the rocks are indeed there to challenge and alert us that something did happen.Biblical implications: Perhaps, the most obvious question for creationists is where does the timing of the impact event fit within the framework of Earth history presented in the Scriptures. Historical narratives in the Bible do not contain a description of an impact event. Consequently, we should be cautious when advocating for a specific position in the absence of explicit biblical references. The Bible does mention the global flood of Genesis as a time of major geologic activity, with the chiastic structure of Genesis 7:11 indicating the involvement of both endogenic and exogenic forces. Among the latter, signified by the “opening of the windows of heaven,” one could fit collisions of extraterrestrial objects. Indeed, in the creationist literature large meteoritic impacts on the Earth are most commonly associated with the flood event.Theological implications: The destructive and catastrophic nature of a large impact event has the potential to raise questions about God’s interaction with the creation and about the nature of His character. One could ask if meteoritic impacts are contingencies allowed to occur within a complex created universe or if they are a direct expression of God’s plan.In particular, if God oversaw the unfolding of the impact event during the Genesis flood, was that accomplished through direct or secondary causation? Was there design and divine intent in the specifics of the location, energy, and timing of the impact? Answers to these questions can be placed on a spectrum between the two extremes of hyperdeterminism, where every minimal detail of geological phenomena has a predetermined purpose, and a naturalistic-like “closed system” view, where God is excluded from any further interaction with the world after the setting in motion of its laws. More significantly, one could ask how the God of love, the giver and protector of life, could be so intimately associated with an utterly destructive event. In searching for answers to these difficult questions, the Genesis narrative clearly describes how the flood and its geologic processes occurred after the entrance of evil into the world and as a consequence of the total corruption of God’s original creation. The textual evidence powerfully presents the flood as the “undoing of creation.” Therefore, God’s action can be seen as a withdrawal of His sustaining, ordering, and life-giving power, an expression of how things dissolve when we reject His presence. And yet, at the acme of the chiastic structure of the Genesis flood narration, we are told that “God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the animals that were with him in the ark” (Gen 8:1). It is hard to imagine a way short of God’s miraculous protection that could preserve a human-made wood vessel and its passengers in the midst of such cataclysmic forces, of which the Chicxulub impact might have been just a small component. However, instead of taking our everyday existence as a granted necessity of nature, we should recognize behind its sustenance the same miraculous grace and mercy that carried the ark and its occupants through a perilous journey.Ronny Nalin, PhD, '}, {'title': 'The Geological Story Told', 'author': 'Iceland', 'doc': 'Iceland is a volcanic island in the North Atlantic Ocean, slightly below the Arctic Circle. The island is situated on a mid-ocean ridge at the boundary between the North American plate and the Eurasian plate.

Continuing upwards in the sequence, we find volcanic products and sediments that are linked to the Ice Age  , and then on top of the sequence at the ridge we find young lava flows and sediments formed after the Ice Age .\\r\\nThe earliest volcanism in Iceland is regarded as being mostly of so called flood basalt type, that is, large outpourings of magma from fissures, forming lava flows that covered widespread areas , . Around the world, we find several provinces with flood basalts that indicate events of great turmoil in earth’s mantle in the past. Some of these lava flows in these provinces have volumes 100’s to 1,000’s of km3. These events are difficult to explain in conventional uniformitarian terms, but fit well into catastrophic creationist models e.g. ,  that place this volcanism in conjunction with the biblical Flood and its aftermath. Flood basalt volcanism has only recently caught the attention of scientists, and ongoing volcanic activity in Iceland could help in deciphering the effects of such colossal volcanism. For example, the eruption of Laki in 1783-84, which is regarded by many geologists as a small flood basalt eruption, created a lava flow field of about 15 km3 in 8 months (common sizes of modern eruptions are <0.1 km3), and released about 120 million tons of sulfur dioxide , triggering temperature drops in Europe of about 1-3°C , . The cooling resulted in bad winters and summers leading to poverty and famine in Europe and the death of thousands of people , while famine and fluoride poisoning of the surface waters in Iceland caused the death of over 50% of the livestock. The 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano was observed to trigger algae blooms under the ash plume , while elevated levels of sulfuric acid, HCL, HF, and metal concentration were measured in snow and precipitation in the Holuhraun eruption in 2014-15 . Furthermore, although not an observation from Iceland, volcanic emissions of CO2 can result in artificial radiocarbon ages  caused by excess CO2 concentrations in the volcanic grounds . These examples demonstrate that the secondary effects of volcanic eruptions can be many, and we expect the environmental pressure of the flood basalt volcanism around the world in earth’s past history to have been enormous, something that creationists should explore in light of the volcanism associated with the biblical Flood and its aftermath.\\r\\nIceland has a wide variety of volcanic products, created in volcanic events ranging from effusive lava outpourings to explosive eruptions . Considering that the largest glaciers in Europe are found in Iceland, some of the volcanic eruptions in Iceland occurred and will occur under glaciers .\\r\\nWhen magma erupts under water/ice it fragments generating tephra and volcanic breccia, which reworked and remobilized in the water form volcanic sediment deposits . Later, these deposits are modified and hardened by hydrothermal alteration and become what geologists call hyaloclastites. Thus, hyaloclastite deposits preserve evidence of transport by currents and gravity flows indicative of relatively rapid formation within the watery environment of these subglacial eruptions. The process of alteration in the hyaloclastites was thought to require a long time but took only a few years to happen in Surtsey Island that emerged from the sea in an eruption in 1963-67 . Therefore, subglacial eruptions may be a good analogue to very dynamic, high-energy watery environments with rapid sedimentation, reworking, transportation and hardening of sedimentary deposits.\\r\\nAnother interesting phenomenon observed in Iceland is the generation of large volumes of meltwater with geothermal activity and volcanism under glaciers. These meltwaters can burst in high-energy catastrophic flooding events. Outburst floods from eruptions in the glacially covered Katla volcano are estimated to have reached flow rates >200,000 m3/s  . The force of such raging waters carve canyons in hours and leave vast sedimentary flood plains. The canyons of the touristic Gullfoss and Detifoss waterfalls, and the “sandur” deposits  in south Iceland are a witness to these glacial outburst floods.\\r\\nTherefore, Iceland provides insight into several geological processes of great relevance to creationists working on developing models for processes that might have occurred during or after the biblical Flood. Going from plate tectonics, the ice age, flood basalt volcanism and its secondary effects, to catastrophic erosion and sedimentation, all these themes are displayed in an unspoiled environment immersed with natural beauty.\\r\\nBjarnason, I., 2008, An Iceland hotspot saga, Jökull, 2008, 58, 3-16.\\r\\nDenk, T.; Grímsson, F. and Kvacek, Z., 2005, The Miocene floras of Iceland and their significance for late Cainozoic North Atlantic biogeography, Botanical Journal of Linnean Society, 149, 369-417.\\r\\nGeirsdóttir, Á., 2011, Chapter 16 - Pliocene and Pleistocene Glaciations of Iceland: A Brief Overview of the Glacial History, Jurgen Ehlers, P.

Geologists who enjoy reading this “book” have found that it consists of two “volumes:” the first, named Precambrian, is mostly devoid of macroscopic fossils. The second, named Phanerozoic, contains layers and sediments providing a rich archive of past forms of animal and vegetal life. The Phanerozoic “volume” is further subdivided in three “sections,” called Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic, each consisting of several “chapters”  .\\r\\nThis article focuses on the Paleozoic interval of the geologic record. Estimates from global compilations of maps suggest that about 20% of the surface of the Earth is covered by Paleozoic rocks . These rocks are usually well preserved, although mineralogical modifications  and physical disruption  are common. Therefore, Paleozoic rocks represent a substantial and accessible part of the rock record and attempting a comprehensive synthesis of their main characteristics in a blog post is an impossible task. This overview concentrates on selected topics about Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks, fossil patterns, and tectonics. The article will close with some suggestions on the significance form a creationist perspective of salient features and trends in Paleozoic rocks.\\r\\nPaleozoic Sedimentary Rocks\\n1) Global Stratigraphic Signal. There is a great variety of types represented in Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. However, when looking at the macroscale, certain types of rocks show a specific frequency increase within the Paleozoic or some of its intervals. This non-random pattern of stratigraphic distribution  is often observed on a global scale. Examples include: Cambrian sandstone composed almost exclusively of quartz , found across most of the North American continent and documented on other continents ; peaks in abundance of carbonate deposits in the lower and mid-Paleozoic , including  globally distributed facies such as stromatolites  and flat-pebble conglomerates  ; widespread marine black shales, rich in organic carbon, common in the lower Paleozoic and upper Devonian-Mississippian ; abundant reef-like deposits in the Silurian and especially in the Devonian ; immense coal deposits in the Pennsylvanian and Permian ; and extremely wide and thick accumulations of evaporites in the Permian .\\r\\n2) Widespread Marine Deposition over the Continents. Lower to mid-Paleozoic sedimentary rocks are remarkable in documenting large-scale flooding and establishment of seas over continental interiors. This is perhaps best seen in the North American rock record, where up to four major successive continent-wide flooding phases can be observed in Paleozoic deposits . The topography of the submerged continents must have been very subdued because the layers deposited over the flooded landscape generally show extremely high lateral continuity and flat basal contacts . In some cases, even thin beds only a few cm thick can be followed laterally for tens of kilometers .\\r\\n3) Upward Increase in Terrestrial Deposits. If it is true that the lower to mid-Paleozoic is dominated by marine deposits even over continental landmasses, terrestrial deposits become substantially more represented in the upper Paleozoic, from the Pennsylvanian upward . In addition, the style of fluvial deposition also appears to differ, with predominantly sheet-like sandy deposits in the lower Paleozoic being complemented from the mid-Paleozoic upward by mud-rich deposits, interpreted as more typical of meandering rivers .\\r\\n4) From Low to High Frequency Cyclicity\\nWhen tracing rock units along the vertical direction, it is common to see repetitions of certain types of deposits . The cyclical pattern in these rock types reflects changes in the environments of deposition, such as variations in water depth and sediment supply. These changes in rock types, often marked by discontinuity surfaces between packages of layers, are observed throughout Paleozoic sedimentary deposits. However, in the upper Paleozoic  a marked increase in the frequency of these sedimentary cycles is observed on a global scale . Broadly speaking, lower to mid-Paleozoic relatively monotonous deposits are overlain by cyclical successions more intensely punctuated by discontinuities and alternations of different rock types.\\r\\nPaleozoic Igneous Rocks\\n1) Volcanic Rocks. It is difficult to systematically address global trends in volumes and types of volcanism during the Paleozoic, because of limitations due to the incomplete nature of the rock record. Notably, while basaltic rocks of the ocean floor offer a continuous record of submarine volcanism for the Cenozoic and part of the Mesozoic, only slivers of Paleozoic oceanic crust are preserved. However, Paleozoic rocks do contain a record of some notable episodes of volcanic activity. For example, Upper Ordovician deposits from North America and Europe contain a cluster of ash layers attributed to some of the largest explosive volcanic eruptions ever recorded in the whole Phanerozoic . Large igneous provinces , which are regions preserving immense volumes of lava effused within a very narrow stratigraphic interval, have also been documented for the Paleozoic. They include Cambrian, Devonian, and Permian examples, the most spectacular being the Siberian Traps in Russia, where an estimated volume of over 2 million km3 of magma were mobilized at the very end of the Paleozoic .\\r\\n2) Plutonic Rocks. Plutonic rocks form from the solidification of magma at depth in the Earth’s crust and constitute the core of the continents. The study of plutonic rocks, therefore, helps to understand the timing and process of formation of the continents. For example, it would be interesting to know how much of the continental crust formed or was recycled during the Paleozoic. Limitations in dating and the incompleteness of the rock record hamper these types of reconstructions. However, some clues can be obtained in indirect ways. Zircon, for example, is a mineral that forms during the crystallization of magma and is very durable and resistant. Even if the original intrusive rock hosting a zircon is eroded, the detrital zircon may survive and be included in younger rocks. Studies looking at the age distribution of detrital zircons indicate that the Paleozoic was one of several intervals with significant crystallization or recycling of crust . Another way to assess the Paleozoic production of plutonic rocks is to look at their preserved surface area compiled from geologic maps. It appears that Paleozoic plutonic rocks are more abundant on the Earth’s surface than their Precambrian or Cenozoic counterparts . This confirms that the Paleozoic was an interval of significant magma emplacement and crystallization.\\r\\nPaleozoic Fossil Patterns\\n1) Diversity Trends. The most remarkable aspect of the Paleozoic rock record is the abundance of macroscopic animal fossils when compared with underlying Precambrian rocks. This major transition has been called the “Cambrian explosion” and occurs in lower Cambrian strata, where fossils of most animal phyla first appear . An equally important interval is what has been called the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event , referring to a remarkable increase in diversity of marine fossil groups in the Lower to Mid-Ordovician . The Cambrian explosion is unique for the sudden appearance of a large number of new animal body plans, but the GOBE shows the greatest increase in diversity of fossil forms within already known body plans. As a result of these two important stratigraphic intervals, Paleozoic marine faunas can be broadly divided in two groups : the Cambrian fauna  and the overlying Paleozoic fauna  . These faunas are punctuated by several turnovers at specific stratigraphic levels , where the coordinated disappearance of certain groups is observed .\\r\\n2) Ecological Trends. Along with increased diversity, the GOBE seems to mark a shift to marine faunal assemblages representative of greater ecological complexity . Cambrian layers contain mostly invertebrates that lived on the surface of bottom sediments, but overlying strata include planktonic organisms, fish, burrowers, and suspension feeders that stood taller above the bottom because they were erect. Another important transition is observed in mid-Paleozoic strata, where the fossil record ceases to include only marine organisms and begins to document terrestrial organisms. Macroscopic fossils of land plants first appear in the Silurian and become more common in the Devonian , terrestrial invertebrates  first appear in the Devonian , and a few tracks and remains of land vertebrates first appear in the Devonian  but become common in the Carboniferous. Notable groups completely absent from Paleozoic layers are dinosaurs, mammals, birds, and flowering plants.\\r\\nPaleozoic Plate Tectonics\\nReconstructions based on paleomagnetism and distribution of major orogenic belts seem to indicate that the initial Paleozoic con. Interestingly, whereas most of the margins of these continents show lowermost Paleozoic patterns of sedimentation typical of passive, extensional margins, a remarkable tectonic shift is observed in the Upper Cambrian to Ordovician, where most of these continental margins show evidence for the onset of large scale active convergence . An intriguing aspect of Ordovician plate tectonics is that none of the widespread convergent margins seem to involve collision between continents but only accretion of microcontinents and volcanic arcs, a condition not seen in any other part of the Phanerozoic . A sustained trend of convergence is consistently documented by orogenic belts along continental margins throughout the Paleozoic, resulting in the progressive amalgamation of the different continental masses. Paleogeographic reconstructions indicate that the continents were finally assembled into a supercontinent  by the Early Permian, a con.\\r\\nAnother feature of interest for Paleozoic plate tectonics is the suggestion of a Cambrian episode of significant true polar wander . This phenomenon implies the redistribution of continental masses with respect to Earth’s axis of rotation resulting in movements of tens of degrees of latitude  and representing a mechanism of plate motions faster than and different from classic plate tectonics.\\r\\nThe Paleozoic: A Creationist Perspective\\nThe existence of a discontinuity in terms of fossil content between the Precambrian and the Paleozoic makes it tempting for creationists to link this horizon to a major discontinuity in Earth’s history. This perception is reinforced when considering that the base of the Paleozoic is often expressed with a physical stratigraphic discontinuity  that marks a mechanical-erosional boundary and a significant shift in sedimentary and tectonic conditions .\\r\\nFrom a biblically informed perspective, a possible candidate to generate such discontinuity would be the global flood of Genesis 6-8. Some Paleozoic sedimentary patterns would fit well on a general level with the description of the biblical catastrophe, in particular the patterns of extensive flooding of continental masses and global signature in the style of sedimentation. Extensive plate rearrangements could also be hypothesized as part of the flood event, and the lowermost Paleozoic presents an interesting interval where both fast plate reorganization and change in predominant tectonic regime seem to be documented. Certainly, plate tectonics offer an important background mechanism to explain several Paleozoic trends. For example, the progressive assembly of Pangea might have controlled the Paleozoic trend in increasing terrestrialization observed both in the sedimentary and fossil record. Interestingly, this parallel increase in preservation of continental deposits and land fossils supports the suggestion of creationists that trends in appearance of fossil groups result at least in part from sampling of different habitats and ecosystems rather than biological evolution. The trend toward a supercontinent con. Finally, active plate convergence during the Paleozoic would account for the modal peak in Paleozoic igneous rocks, as continental collision settings tend to be favorable for the preservation of new continental crust .\\r\\nIn the modern history of creationism, the general consensus about where to place Paleozoic rocks in biblical history has followed an interesting trajectory. The majority of Scriptural geologists, in the first half of the 19th century, assigned the formation of Paleozoic rocks to the time between Day 3 of creation and the onset of the flood . The trend was decidedly reversed in the 20th century, when key . Price, H. Clark, H. Morris, and J. Whitcomb clearly interpreted the formation of Paleozoic fossil-bearing rocks as a consequence of the flood . In the past two decades, there has been renewed consideration among some creationists of the possibility that part of the Paleozoic might have been deposited before the flood .\\r\\nGiven the immensity of data archived in the Paleozoic rock record, any attempt at a synthetic model from a creationist perspective will have to find the delicate balance between an ability to see the bigger picture without overlooking important details. Before that balance is reached, an exciting work of study and discovery will continue to accompany us in our journey.\\r\\nRonny Nalin, PhD\\n\\nEndontes\\n41.

Clausen', 'doc': 'Because the Precambrian part of geologic history covers so much material, the discussion is split into three parts with this being the third. Here is a summary of the three sections:A CREATIONIST PERSPECTIVECreationists have two major ways  of explaining the Precambrian record:  it was mainly formed during the first half of creation week; or  the inorganic Earth is actually billions of years old, but then God created life on Earth a few thousand years ago.First scenario. Those who believe that the entire creation is young note that: it may be inconsistent to explain the earth, light, water, air, land, sun, moon, and stars as created by process over long periods, but explain the birds, fish, animals, and humans as created by fiat in a week; the heavens and starry host were created fiat (Ps 33:6-9) and apparently as part of the six days (Gen 2:1; see also Doukhan, 2004, p.29-32); if the creation is partly old and partly young, then God had one Decalogue (see, Ex 20:8-11) for millions of years and then changed it a few thousand years ago. Personally, this scenario seems to be the most consistent reading of the inspired record.In this scenario, Andrew Snelling  has suggested that the first few days of creation week involved unique inorganic processes not happening today: they exhibited a departure from the laws of thermodynamics, for matter was formed ex nihilo and useful energy increased. Robert Gentry  has used pleochroic haloes as an evidence for the rapid formation of granitic rocks on the third day of creation. Michael Oard  has suggested that any evidence for Precambrian glaciation can be explained in other ways. One summary discussion of this all-young creation can be found at Creation Ministries International.Snelling  fully recognizes that the Precambrian is a major part of the geologic record. He then emphasizes  that during the first day of creation week the Universe, the Earth, light, and the night-day cycle were created. Snelling  suggests that the second day of creation week saw the creation of the atmosphere from volcanic gases, interstellar space to hold the sun, moon, and stars, and Earth’s earliest crust from hot magma and hydrothermal fluids from the mantle. The third day  brought the creation of the dry land and seas by horizontal and vertical catastrophic plate tectonics at supernatural rates, as well as creation of soils and plants and of cyanobacteria that form stromatolite structures. During the fourth day  major tectonic activity could have continued, but primarily God created the sun, moon, and stars to take over the light-giving function.Second scenario. Those who accept that part of creation may be old and part young note that: angels may have existed before the creation of this world (Job 38:7; Eze 28:12-15); Genesis 1 may not indicate when the angels, stars, sun, moon and Earth  were created; heaven and earth may only refer to the firmament  and dry land .This “old earth / young life” idea  has not been developed scientifically, but has been briefly outlined by Gorman Gray . This scenario would probably accept much of the standard scientific model outlined above for the inorganic material of the earth. It would probably include long ages of plate tectonic activity with the accompanying earthquakes and volcanoes, and long ages of radioactive decay that are found in Precambrian rocks and could be inherited into more recent rocks by recycling. It would probably only reject the origin of complex life before a recent creation week.Complex life. In neither of these scenarios would one expect to find evidence of complex life in the Precambrian. Therefore, creationists would dispute the evidence for life in the Precambrian, or attribute the evidence to non-organic processes, or explain it as the result of later organisms invading deep Precambrian rocks . However, some creationists might accept the evidence pointing to pre-creation life, since single-celled organisms are not mentioned in the Genesis creation record.Evolutionists as well would not expect to find complex life in the Precambrian. When asked what evidence might destroy his confidence in the theory of evolution, J. B. S. Haldane reportedly responded with \"Precambrian rabbits\" as one example. Although not rabbits, at one point it was suggested that angiosperm pollen had been found in the Precambrian, but with further analysis the evidence appeared to be the result of sample contamination .The strongest creationist evidence against the standard scientific scenario is based on the difficulty of explaining the origin of life from non-life . In addition, the sudden appearance of a great variety of complex life forms in Cambrian rocks, right above the Precambrian, seems difficult to explain in the standard evolutionary paradigm. The Cambrian explosion argument presented by creationists is outlined by The Discovery Institute, The Centre for Intelligent Design, Answers in Genesis, and Creation-Evolution Headlines. The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry presents a counter-response.Summary. No matter what scenario is accepted, creationists attribute Earth’s geology data to God working either through natural processes or by direct intervention.'}, {'title': 'The Role of Catastrophes in Scientific Thinking', 'author': 'Ariel A. Roth', 'doc': 'The cathedral was crowded; this was All Saints’ Day! Unexpectedly, the building started shaking and the parishioners tried to rush out through the arched entrance. Others were trying to escape from another church located on one side of the cathedral, while buildings several stories high rose ominously on the other side. Suddenly, moments later, the fronts of the churches and accompanying buildings came crashing down towards each other and buried all the poor souls gathered there.This was the famous Lisbon, Portugal earthquake of November 1, 1755, that destroyed over half of the town and much beyond. Three major tsunamis followed and fires burning for five days contributed to further destruction. The earthquake’s magnitude has been estimated at 8.7 and some suggest that on that day as many as 90,000 to 100,000 people perished in Europe and Africa. Its effects were unusually widespread, being noted even in the Caribbean region, thus involving three continents. While a few other larger earthquakes have been reported, the Lisbon earthquake is likely the most significant, especially because of its profound philosophical implications on humanity’s thinking. It came at a very critical time in western thought. Where was God? How could a beneficent loving God, who had sent His Son to save humanity, allow such a tragic event?There is an abundance of literature that addresses the apparent conflict between God’s goodness and the presence of evil in the universe . Among the more prevailing resolutions is the suggestion that  suffering is necessary in order for us to develop a good character. Related to this is the idea that  calamities such as earthquakes teach us that the principle of cause and effect prevails, the universe is rational, and good and evil have their consequences. Still another dominant view is that  God grants freewill, and we are allowed to make wrong choices that can have bad consequences. True freedom requires that evil be permitted. Since God has granted freewill in the universe, He is not responsible for the evil brought about by those who cause suffering in a great conflict between good and evil.  Others suggest that “earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings do!” That statement is too often correct, since the mass mortality of earthquakes could be dramatically reduced if we would construct stronger buildings.  The Bible suggests that God is involved in some catastrophes like the great Genesis flood. A loving God’s involvement is explained because it “grieved” God to bring on the catastrophic Genesis Flood, and He did it to save as many as He could of a humanity that had become “only evil continually.” In that context, the horrendous Flood was primarily the result of humanity’s wickedness—the consequence of the freewill that God has granted.  Some suggest that God is not directly involved in many natural disasters. The frequent earthquakes we experience, including the one in Lisbon, occur as the earth adjusts imbalances. The worldwide Genesis Flood could have caused a lot of imbalance in the crust of the earth that is still adjusting even today. Considering how intricate reality is, it is likely that several explanations are valid.BIG CATASTROPHESCatastrophes come in many forms and rates. One of the more exotic ones was the 1986 sudden release of a huge cloud of mainly carbon dioxide gas from Lake Nyos in Cameroon. The cloud replaced the air in the region, suffocating some 1700 people. Avalanches, landslides, hurricanes, and tornadoes , occasionally take their toll. Likely, the most significant catastrophic agents are earthquakes, floods and volcanoes. One of my most memorable days was watching volcanic flows on the Island of Hawaii . I had never seen rocks form so fast! Lava pouring from fractures in India cover 500,000 square kilometers of the famous Deccan Volcanic Field, indicating widespread volcanic activity. Water inundation tends to be very devastating. The greatest example is the Genesis Food that covered the whole world. Earthquakes can generate huge waves call tsunamis. In 2004, more than 250,000 perished in one day from a tsunami in southeast Asia. Waters behind the 100 meter high Teton Dam in Idaho eroded it down in less than two hours. Catastrophes like the Lisbon earthquake are commonly rapid events.The degree of importance of catastrophes for the geologic history of the earth has been the basis of a long scientific controversy that involves deep time questions. Before the nineteenth century, in spite of the Enlightenment movement, most scientists believed the biblical account of beginnings, although there were some varied interpretations. The very dominant view was that there was a recent creation by God a few thousand years ago, followed by the catastrophic worldwide Genesis Flood. The abundant fossils, coming from the kind of organisms that live in the ocean, but that were so abundant in the high Alps of Europe, were interpreted as evidence of that astonishing Flood.CATASTROPHES REJECTEDAn earthquake like the one in Lisbon dramatically illustrates how rapidly some geologic changes can take place. However, just a few decades later, a few geologists were suggesting that things had gone on more slowly and for a much longer time than proposed by the biblical model of origins. In 1830 a seminal book appeared titled Principles of Geology. That book would lead to important changes not only in geological thinking, but for science in general. Written by Charles Lyell, it became very popular, running through 11 editions. One can get the gist of Lyell’s thinking from a letter he wrote to his colleague, the geologist Roderick Murchison. There he states that “no causes whatever have from the earliest time to which we can look back , to the present, ever acted but those now acting and … they never acted with different degrees of energy from that which they now exert.” The emphasis was on slow geologic changes over long geologic ages instead of rapid catastrophic changes.Two major concepts came into conflict at this time. The traditional catastrophism view proposed that major catastrophes, usually of worldwide consequences, have been the primary agent in shaping the crust of the earth. A lot of time is not required. The new view, uniformitarianism, proposed that ordinary rates of change operating over very long periods of time, have been the important factors in forming the crust. Catastrophes are not important, but a very long time for slow changes is required. Catastrophism fits well with the Biblical model of origins, while uniformitarianism fits the model of slow development over eons of time. This new view blatantly challenged the truthfulness of the Bible. Was it not the true word of God? Much more than just geologic interpretations were at stake here.At this same time, several geologists in England, some of whom had strongly supported the creation and Flood model of the Bible, started considering the need for long ages in the geologic layers. Also, as championed by Charles Darwin’s seminal Origin of Species, ideas about the gradual evolution of life forms over a very long time started to be accepted. Catastrophism became the equivalent of a dirty word. It was in the same category as creationism finds itself in the scientific community today: totally unacceptable. Interpretations involving major catastrophes were not allowed. Uniformitarianism won and became dogma for well over a century.CATASTROPHES REACCEPTEDHowever, all was not well. Study of the rocks revealed facts that seemed to require catastrophism. In 1923, the geologist Harlan Bretz from the University of Chicago, was studying the scoured southeast quarter of the state of Washington. There was evidence of hundreds of ancient waterfalls, some of them 100 meters high , and lots of other evidence for catastrophic activity.Bretz dared to suggest in a geological publication that a major, short lived catastrophic flood had produced this washed out landscape. But catastrophes were not allowed. To adopt a model so close to the biblical Flood implied retreating back to the “Dark Ages.” In Bretz’s own words, “the heresy must be gently but firmly stamped out.” Bretz needed special attention from his colleagues, and was offered a hearing before the Geolgocal Society of Washigton, DC. A phalanx of doubters were present to challenge the flood hypothesis. After Bretz’s detailed report, five members of the prestigious United States Geological Survey presented objections to the flood model. Two of them had not even visited the study area! Apparently, no one at the meting changed their minds, but in succeeding years more and more data from the rocks that supported Bretz’s view was discovered, and the views of this modern day Noah and his likewise unwanted flood were vindicated. For his careful work and bravery, Bretz was later awarded the Penrose Medal, the United States’ most prestigious geological award.Another problem arose along the southern California coast. Layers of sedimentary rock, both on land  and offshore, showed shallow water features and fossils mixed with deep water fossils found only hundreds of meters down in the ocean.How could that be if everything was laid down slowly under quiet conditions? Furthermore, experiments in the laboratory had shown that mud flowing under water, called a turbidity current, could travel rapidly down slope, resulting in complex characteristic deposits called turbidites . In . Deposits from a single turbidite can sometimes reach 200 meters in thickness. The mystery of the shallow and deep water sources found in the same layer is resolved if, along the southern California coast, you had turbidity currents flowing from a shallow shoreline source to a deep locality where deep water organisms were picked up into the flow.All of this occurred around the middle of the Twentieth Century, and at that same time details of an earlier major turbidity current flow into the North Atlantic Ocean were being worked out. An earthquake along the maritime provinces of eastern Canada loosened a lot of sediment on the edge of the continental shelf, and that sediment flowed down as a turbidity current unto the abyssal plain at the foot of the continental slope. The flow ran into the hulk of the Titanic that had been there since 1912. The turbidity current also broke a number of transatlantic cables lying on the floor of the ocean. One could tell where the head of the flow was when the cables quit transmitting messages; and calculations indicated rates of travel of over 100 kilometers per hour. The turbidity current took about 13 hours to extend out 700 kilometers from its source. The resulting one meter thick turbidite had an estimated volume of 100 cubic kilometers, covering an area of 100,000 square kilometers. The turbidite concept quickly gained momentum, and just two decades later it could be stated that “tens of thousands of graded beds stacked on top of one another have been interpreted as turbidites.”THE DEEP MEANINGWhat happened during the middle of the 20th Century, is that significant data was plainly indicating that the strict uniformitarianism stance of the geologic community was wrong. Gradually other geologists dared to suggest other catastrophic interpretations, including the suggestion that an asteroid hit the earth and killed off the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous Period. Based mainly on data from the rocks, catastrophism was making a dramatic return. This change has been identified as “a great philosophical breakthrough” and it was acknowledged that “the profound role of major storms through out geologic history is becoming increasingly recognized.” The new catastrophism is a little different from the classical catastrophism where the biblical Genesis Flood dominated. Now major catastrophes are accepted, but often a lot of time is postulated between them, thus accommodating the long geologic ages concept.There is a deep lesson to be learned from the turbulent history of the catastophism concept of the scientific community. First catastrophism was the accepted view, then the concept was expelled from acceptable interpretations, only to be reaccepted 130 years later. The complex sociological and psychological reasons for such changes are beyond simple analysis, but we can still learn from what happened. Once a concept is thoroughly rejected by the scientific community, this does not mean that it is wrong, furthermore this does not mean the scientific community will not readopt it. While science is worthy of qualified respect, reality is above humanity’s drifting opinions.Ariel Roth, PhDLoma Linda, CANOTES For details of this infamous event, see Chapter 1 in Shrady N. 2008.

Roth', 'doc': 'The first book of the Bible states that following a recent creation by God, there was an astonishing worldwide Flood. In that context, the Flood would have been responsible for most of the great fossil bearing layers of the earth. However, current scientific interpretations propose that these layers slowly accumulated over billions of years thus allocating more time for the slow gradual evolution of life. The difference between these two models could hardly be greater. . The main divisions of the stack of rock layers covering our earth, called the geologic column, is shown to the left; the evolutionary interpretation of those layers in the middle, and the creation model to the right. Note especially that the evolutionary model is about one million times slower than the biblical model. Which model is true? They cannot both be right!\\r\\nInterestingly, one does not at all have to go to the Bible in order to find the concept of a worldwide Flood. That idea is overwhelmingly dominant in the folk literature of the world. The number of references from that literature for different kinds of worldwide past calamities is listed in this Table, and shows that flood stories are six times as common as any other kind of past worldwide catastrophes. The most likely explanation for such pervasiveness is that the Flood actually occurred.\\r\\nWhile the scientific community overwhelmingly rejects the biblical account of a worldwide Flood, a significant amount of scientific data fits better with that account than with a model of slow development over billions of years. In considering the scientific data, we are especially interested in sedimentary rocks. They are the dominant ones and water is usually involved in their deposition into sedimentary layers that often harbor fossils. Geologists usually group these layers into larger units called formations. Many of the formations on our continents are incredibly widespread and tend to be of somewhat even thickness. The contrast between these huge unique flat sedimentary deposits and the dominantly irregular topography of the surface of our present continents is striking. There is no way, under present conditions, to spread such sedimentary deposits, which are relatively thin, over major parts of our present continents. Very flat surfaces are required to start out with, and major forces are needed to spread the sediments over such huge areas. Some of these deposits are conglomerates that required very high energy transport over very wide areas. The arrows in . The surface area of each formation in square kilometers is: Frontier 300,000; Mowry 250,000; Dakota: 815,000; Cedar Mountain-Burrow Canyon 130,000; and Morrison 1,000,000. This latter formation extends from New Mexico into Canada . This is data that is very much more like what would be expected from a worldwide catastrophic Flood, as layer after layer of sediments were quite rapidly and extensively deposited on top of the other. It is not what would be expected for deposits formed slowly by ordinary localized geological processes over billions of years, as now generally postulated by the geological community.\\r\\nIt is not just the geologic formations that are widespread, but within these formations you have smaller units, called beds, that also represent extremely flat and widespread depositional forces as expected for the Flood. The arrow in . As you travel east from Price Utah, near where it originated, into Colorado, you can follow that sandstone unit for 160 kilometers. Another example is seen in coal seams where thin layers of grainy sediments called partings  can be found . These are in the centimeters range in thickness but can be incredibly widespread. Six partings that extend over 1,500 km2 are reported from coal mines in Kentucky. In the Grand Canyon, 17 characteristic horizontal key marker layers are reported in the 100 meter thick Muav Limestone . These marker layers are dominantly a meter or less thickness, and all but one spreads over 50 to 150 kilometers. Some geologists recognize the incongruity between present limited depositional patterns of local floods and what is actually seen in the rock record. Sedimentologist Carlton Brett, who does not endorse the Flood, comments:\\r\\n“… beds may persist over areas of many hundreds to thousands of square kilometers precisely because they are the record of truly, oversized events.”\\r\\n“The accumulation of the permanent stratigraphic  record in many cases involves processes that have not been, or cannot be observed in modern environments. … there are the extreme events … with magnitudes so large and devastating that they have not, and probably could not, be observed scientifically.”\\r\\n“I would also argue that many successions show far more lateral continuity and similarity at a far finer scale than would be anticipated by most geologists.”When you start studying the incredibly widespread distribution of the geologic layers, you soon begin to realize that the conditions for their deposition are often strikingly different from what occurs for present local geological activity, and that widespread distribution is as would be expected from the catastrophic Flood described in the Bible.Adding further evidence for rapid deposition, as expected for the Flood, is that where significant parts of the geologic column are missing between layers, the evidence for the deep erosion expected over millions of years of no deposition postulated by geologists is missing.  For instance, between the Morrison and the Cedar Mountain Formations  , layers representing a postulated 20 million years of evolutionary time are missing at this locality. During that time, an average of 600 meters of erosion of the surface of that gap would be expected. Erosion as seen in modern environments is dominantly irregular, however, the contacts between the two formations mentioned above are incredibly flat permitting one thin formation to be laid on top of the other. These flat gaps, which are found in numerous localities around the world, provide rather convincing evidence that the long geological ages never occurred. . At the lowest arrow, the Ordovician and Silurian periods of the geologic column are missing, yet the contact line is incredibly flat in most of the Grand Canyon. During the 100 million years assumed for that flat gap, one would expect an average of 3 kilometers of erosion. For comparison, note that the Grand Canyon is only 1.5 kilometers deep.\\r\\nGeologists recognize the anomaly of abundant marine sediment deposition on the continents and explain it simply by postulating that in the past, the oceans were higher or the continents were lower thus facilitating inundation from the sea resulting in immense flat limestone layers. In proposing this, they are inadvertently suggesting what we would expect from the great Flood described in the Bible; the continents were under water! The noted paleontologist Norman Newell who endorses the long geologic ages also recognizes the difference between the sedimentary record of the present and the past and references three other supporting geologists when he states:\\r\\n“Search for present day analogues of paraconformities in limestone sequences is complicated by the fact that most present con.”\\nThese “immense and incredibly flat” areas of the world are what would be expected from the great catastrophic Flood, but not from slow local deposition of sediments as the continents slowly moved around and up and down over billions of years as postulated by geologists who do not conceptualize the biblical Flood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many interpretations about the amount of time involved with the formation of various parts of the geologic record of the earth. A long list of local interpretations on both sides of the Bible-science controversy could be presented. Unfortunately, at present, the scientific community does not accommodate the biblical model of the Flood in its journals and textbooks. Instead these publications have many endorsements for the long geological ages but not for the biblical model. The Flood question is not approached from the perspective of a level playing field. However, one does not have to abandon science in order to believe the Bible. The incredibly widespread flat sedimentary formations and the layers within them, the lack of evidence for long ages at the flat gaps between sedimentary layers, and the abundance of material from oceans on the continents are powerful worldwide factors that very much favor the Flood model of the Bible. This is data that is difficult to explain outside the biblical model of origins.\\r\\nAriel A. Roth For examples and references see: Roth AA. 1998. Origins: Linking Science and Scriptures.

What kind of information is used to make these inferences? The answer to these questions has the potential for influencing our models of the Earth’s climate through time and can surely offer insight in formulating creationist interpretations of the rock record.The Cenozoic glaciationThe Earth as we see it today is characterized by the presence of large ice caps and extensive alpine glaciers. However, there is widespread evidence that the volume of ice has considerably decreased in the relatively recent past.Conventional climate reconstructions suggest that the Cenozoic interval, from the Oligocene upwards, was punctuated by periodic oscillations of alternating glacial and interglacial stages . The last of these glacial culminations  is thought to have occurred  at 19 ka before present . During the LGM, large ice sheets covered northern Europe, Canada, and the northern part of the United States and Russia  and the increase in ice volume resulted in the lowering of sea level down to about 130 m below present sea level .Evidence of glacial activityThe LGM produced the more accessible and better preserved traces of glacial activity, offering fresh examples of geological features indicative of glacial environments. These include:a) Glacigenic depositsDuring glacial advance, sediment accumulates at the glacier edges or is deposited at the base of the flowing ice mass. Sediment is also deposited during glacial retreat, when melting ice drops its sedimentary load, which can be further reworked by meltwater discharge. Overall, glacigenic deposits are characterized by a chaotic mixture of fine and coarse sediment, which is called till or, when lithified, tillite.An interesting type of glacigenic deposit is represented by erratic boulders. They consist of large fragments of rocks  transported by glaciers along remarkable distances  and subsequently abandoned after melting of the supporting ice.When an ice-sheet extends beyond the limit of continental land, it forms an ice shelf floating on the surface of the water. Melting of the ice shelf causes disruption into numerous individual icebergs which can then travel many hundreds of kilometers before melting or capsizing. These icebergs may contain large-sized rocks that are dropped on the sea bottom as the ice melts, thus their name dropstones.b) Glacigenic landformsErosive and depositional processes related to glacial activity can create very distinctive landforms. In mountain areas, for example, the effects of erosion related to multiple advances and retreats of alpine glaciers can create valleys with a characteristic U-shaped profile. There are other typical glacigenic landforms less familiar to the general public but known with their own specific name, such as drumlins, eskers, kettle holes, and kames.c) Glacigenic abrasion structuresRock fragments enclosed at the base of a flowing glacier can generate linear grooves on the bedrock, often parallel, which can be used to reconstruct the flow direction of a glacier. Not only the bedrock but also the rock fragments sliding on it can bear marks of abrasion. Ice flowing over an irregular hard substrate usually rounds the irregularities forming asymmetric undulations called roches moutonnées. Over time, intensive abrasion will further level the irregularities and create a roughly planar striated pavement.d) Indirect evidence of glaciationGlaciations determine changes in the Earth’s system  likely to leave a trace in the geologic record. Therefore, reconstructions of past ice ages can be based on indirect evidence of climate change . This evidence includes variations in abundances of chemical elements in ice cores and lacustrine and marine sediments, markers of drop and rise in sea level, and changes in fossil content.Ancient glaciations and the geologic recordMost of the above-described features related to glacial activity have been identified in different positions of the stratigraphic column, in successions preserved over the five continents. Although dating of these successions is not always easy, glacigenic-like features seem to cluster over four intervals . Therefore, it is usually concluded that the Earth experienced at least four major periods of glaciation in addition to the Cenozic one .However, it should be noted that unlike the record of the Cenozoic glaciation, the evidence for older ice-ages is less definitive and relies on more assumptions. This is partly due to the fact that geological processes  have disrupted and altered the record of past events, and partly to the existence of alternative mechanisms that can produce features analogous to those described from glacial environments. With older successions, where data are more limited and fragmentary, dismissing the role of these alternative mechanisms in favor of a glacigenic scenario may prove to be problematic. For example, till-like deposits are also known to be produced from sedimentation of submarine mass flows  and this mechanism has indeed been proposed to reassess the origin of deposits formerly interpreted as glacigenic (Arnaud & Eyles, 2002; Rice, 2004; Eyles & Januszczak, 2007). Even dropstones, which are often considered one of the most reliable indicators of glacial processes, can be emplaced by mechanisms different than ice rafting, such as vegetational rafting and submarine mass flows (Bennet et al., 1996; Donovan & Pickerill, 1997).Deposits of the two oldest glaciations, especially the Neoproterozoic glaciation , pose an additional problem in their climatic interpretation. Paleogeographic reconstructions based on paleomagnetic data  indicate that part of these deposits were located at tropical latitudes at the time of their formation. This has led some researchers to hypothesize a Neoproterozoic “Snowball Earth” entirely covered with ice , a scenario which is not completely accepted by other researchers (McCall, 2006; Allen & Etienne, 2008).Implications for creationist modelsAlthough at least some of the evidence for past glaciations could be explained by invoking alternative processes, Precambrian ice ages  are potentially not in conflict with creationist views of Earth history. It is possible that before the creation of life the planet was at least partially covered by ice. Similar conditions are observed on Mars, a planet of the solar systems with polar ice caps . On the other hand, deposits attributed to the Ordovician and Permo-Carboniferous glaciations  are enclosed within the Paleozoic rock record, where fossil-bearing sediments document coeval existence of many forms of life on Earth. Therefore, these two ice-ages are more difficult to accept in short-chronology creationist models, especially if the Paleozoic rock record is viewed as deposited during the Genesis flood.The chronology of past ice-ages is also an aspect where creationists differ with geologic models based on radiometric ages of millions or hundreds of thousands of years. Some attempts have been made at framing at least the Cenozoic glaciation in a short-chronology model .Independently of the dating and preferred interpretation of Paleozoic glacigenic-like deposits, both creationist and non-creationist geologists agree that the Mesozoic is a portion of the stratigraphic column with no indications of glacigenic features  whereas the Cenozoic preserves convincing evidence of glacial activity. This stratigraphic distribution of glacial deposits is consistent with creationist models that associate Mesozoic deposits with the peak of the flood and consider Cenozoic deposits as mostly post-flood. Glacial activity would not be expected in an advanced stage of the flood, whereas a climate deterioration leading to glaciation could be triggered in the recovery phase subsequent to the flood and extending into the present.The Cenozoic glaciation is thought to have been characterized by cyclic fluctuations that can be globally correlated . These fluctuations between glacial and interglacial conditions have been explained as resulting from variations in orbital parameters of the Earth (e.g., Maslin et al., 1998; Huybers & Wunsch, 2005; Roe, 2006), happening over time scales of 100 ka , 40 ka  and 20 ka . These time ranges are problematic from a short-chronology perspective, and creationists have motivation to search for alternative processes that could account for this global cyclical signal within a much shorter time scale.In conclusion, careful study of modern glacigenic deposits and structures is important for the interpretation of past glacigenic-like deposits. At the same time, creationists approach evidence for glaciation in the geological record with an eye open to explore alternative interpretative hypotheses compatible with short-chronology models of the history of the Earth. The term “interglacial” is used to indicate a warm period with reduced ice caps between two cold periods with extensive ice cover. ka = 1,000 yearsRonny Nalin, PhD\"}, {'title': 'How Do Plate Tectonics Relate to the Bible?', 'author': 'Benjamin L. Clausen', 'doc': 'If someone asks you any question about geology and your answer includes the phrase “plate tectonics,” you have a fairly good chance of being correct or at least on track to the right answer. Plate tectonic theory provides an explanation for the formation of volcanic and granitic rocks. It explains why mountains occur in some places and depressions in others; why the continents are above sea level and the ocean floor is below sea level. The theory also explains earthquakes as the sudden jerking of two plates slipping past each other.To understand how plate tectonics relate to the Bible, this chapter first describes basic plate tectonic theory and the evidence for it. Geographic examples connect the theory to well-known earth features and demonstrate its all-encompassing applicability. Next, plate tectonic theory is related to the Bible, by considering the history of the theory, Bible geography, and God’s action in the world. Then plate tectonics issues are presented under the headings of scientific revolution, theodicy and catastrophe, time, pre-fossiliferous rocks, and heat dissipation. The conclusion recognizes that much about plate tectonics is unknown because of our finite human understanding.Plate Tectonic TheoryPlates and Their Movement. Plate tectonics involves more than just the splitting of a supercontinent ; it is the motion of all the continents and “sub-continents” in various changing directions. The earth is made up of seven major plates: six roughly equivalent to the six continents and the seventh encompassing much of the Pacific Ocean. Important smaller plates alluded to in this article include the Arabian, Indian, Philippine, and Caribbean Plates, and the Juan de Fuca, Cocos, and Nazca Plates along the east side of the Pacific Plate.Most geologic activity of interest to researchers occurs at plate boundaries where two plates move apart , together , or past each other . At divergent spreading centers such as the inactive East African Rift and the active Mid-Atlantic Ridge, new crustal material is formed . At convergent subduction zones, mountains are formed, such as the Andes, Alps, and Sierra Nevadas, Himalayas, and volcanic islands such as the Aleutians and Japan. At a transform boundary, two plates move past each other, such as at the San Andreas Fault in California and at the fault along the Jordan River Valley.In addition to activity at plate boundaries, in some places hot magma from the earth’s mantle ascends as a plume in plate interiors to heat the crust and produce volcanoes. Such a stationary hot spot under the moving Pacific Plate yielded the string of Hawaiian volcanoes and another under North America produced volcanism across Idaho, culminating in present day activity in Yellowstone.Differentiation. According to theory, plate tectonic processes began in a homogeneous early earth. Magma welled up at early spreading centers, forming new oceanic crust. Volcanic and granitic rock was forged at subduction zones, making new continental crust. As material in the earth’s interior partially melted, rose to the surface in magma form, then crystallized, the earth’s elements differentiated into lighter minerals at the surface and heavier ones in the interior. Several cycles of this process yielded the less dense mountains and continents above sea level and the denser ocean basins below sea level, since crustal rock of lower density “floats” higher on the earth’s “liquid” interior.Mechanisms. Three mechanisms have been suggested as causing plate tectonic motion: 1) plates are pushed apart as magma from the earth’s mantle rises at the spreading centers to form new crust; 2) plates are pulled together as old crust is dragged back down into the mantle at subduction zones; and, 3) crustal plates are carried along in “conveyor belt fashion” on top of convection cells that are in the plastic mantle of the earth’s interior. The actual cause of plate tectonic motion is probably some combination of all three mechanisms.Evidence. Evidence for plate tectonic theory comes from differing geochemical data in the earth’s crust, mantle, and core, as well as from geophysical data (e.g., seismic waves, heat flow rates, gravity variations, and the earth’s magnetic field). Earthquakes provide the most direct evidence for plate motion. Less dramatic evidence comes from highly accurate GPS stations located on the various continents that indicate relative plate motions of 20-200 mm/year. Early evidence for plate motion came from maps showing similar contours of the Old and New World continents, suggesting that they once fit together like a puzzle. In some locations, confirmation was provided by similar rocks and fossils located in matching regions of separated continents.In the 1960s, ocean crust patterns provided compelling evidence leading to near-universal acceptance of plate tectonic theory. The radiometric ages and alternating magnetic patterns of the Atlantic Ocean floor seemed to be arranged symmetrically on both sides of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Plate tectonic theory provided a succinct explanation for this: oceanic crust was continuously formed as magma moved up, cooled and solidified, and then was pushed away from the spreading center in both directions. When the magma solidified, the iron-bearing minerals in it were frozen in alignment with the earth’s magnetic field at the time. As the direction of the earth’s magnetic field alternated between north and south, normal and reverse magnetic polarity directions were symmetrically frozen into the oceanic crust.Plate Tectonics and the BibleScience from the Bible. Theologians suggested early plate tectonic ideas related to the Bible. In 1668, French cleric François Placet suggested that “before the deluge America was not separated from the other parts of the earth.” In the 1700s, German theologian Theodor Christoph Lilienthal suggested a separation of land by water based on an exegesis of 1 Chron. 1:19 (or Gen. 11:25); however, if one associates plate tectonics with Noah’s flood, the separation would have happened sooner than indicated in these verses. In 1858, French geographer Antonio Snider-Pellegrini noted the parallelism of opposing shores of the Atlantic Ocean and inferred that an originally continuous landmass had been split to form the Atlantic at the time of Noah’s Flood.1Bible Geography. Important geographical features described in the Bible are the result of plate tectonic activity. Mt. Sinai is made up of Precambrian granite emplaced before most fossils were buried. The island of Patmos is a recent volcanic formation, created as the African Plate subducted beneath the Eurasian Plate. Mt. Hermon, the Sea of Galilee, the Jordan River, the Dead Sea, and the Gulf of Aqaba are located on a north-south transform fault where earthquakes frequently occur as the Arabian plate slips past the African plate. Parts of Galilee and the area east of the Dead Sea are covered with black volcanic basalt produced at the boundary between these two plates. These plates are pushed together at a bend in the transform fault to form Mt. Hermon and are pulled apart in another place to form the Dead Sea depression. In the Red Sea, the plates are actually diverging at a spreading zone.God’s Action. The Bible refers to plate tectonic activity when it describes earthquakes and volcanoes, and in some cases, Scriptures indicate that these phenomena are directly caused by God. He apparently caused the earthquake that resulted in the swallowing up of Korah and company (Num. 16:31,32). Other earthquakes implying divine origin occurred during Jonathan’s attack on the garrison in Gibeah (1 Sam. 14:15), while Elijah was at Horeb (1 Kings 19:11), at Jesus’ crucifixion and resurrection (Matt. 27:51; 28:2), and when Paul was in prison at Philippi (Acts 16:26).More indirectly, the Old Testament mentions an earthquake that occurred in the days of King Uzziah (Amos 1:1; Zech. 14:5). Other references to the earth moving are more general (Job 9:6; Ps. 18:7; 46:2,3; Jer. 4:24), are the result of judgment (Ps. 60:2; Is. 13:13,14; 24:19,20; 29:6), or are prophecies (Ez. 38:19; Zech. 14:4; Matt 24:7; Mark 13:8; Luke 21:11; Rev. 11:19).Indications of God causing mountains to burn, melt, flow, or smoke may be references to volcanoes (Ps. 97:5; 144:5; Is. 34:9,10; 64:1-3; Jer. 51:25). In the future, the elements will melt with fervent heat (2 Pet. 3:10) and a lake of fire will be used in judgment (Rev. 19:20; 20:10,14,15; 21:8). When God descended upon Mt. Sinai, it both quaked (Ex. 19:18; Ps. 68:8; 77:18; 114:4-7; Heb. 12:26) and burned (Deut. 4:11; 5:23; Judges 5:5). Other texts refer to both earthquake and volcanic type activity occurring at God’s presence (Ps. 104:32; Mic. 1:4; Nah. 1:5,6).Issues in Plate TectonicsA Scientific Revolution. Plate tectonics provides a classic example of a scientific revolution — a major change in paradigm as new data becomes available. Alfred Wegener’s ideas about continental drift in the 1920s were derided because he provided no mechanism for the continents to drift through the ocean floor like a ship plowing through an ice pack. Not until the 1960s were his ideas resurrected, albeit in a slightly different form, based on new data from the ocean floor. Now most every explanation in geology is connected in some way to the paradigm of plate tectonics. The new plate tectonic model incorporated much from previous geology theory, but the data are now set in a new framework. This exemplifies how an earth history model has changed in major ways and indicates that significant changes will no doubt occur in the years to come.Theodicy and Catastrophe. The Bible recognizes the cyclical uniformity of natural law (Eccl. 1:4-7), but also warns of catastrophes. The 8.7 magnitude Lisbon earthquake of November 1755 was due to African Plate subduction beneath the Eurasian Plate. It triggered a 5-10 meter high tsunami and killed 60,000 people. This led to questions about God’s responsibility for evil, exemplified by Voltaire’s book, Candide. The 9.1 magnitude Banda Aceh earthquake and resulting tsunami of December 2004 due to subduction of the Australian Plate beneath the Eurasian Plate killed more than 150,000 people. More recent examples are the 7.0 magnitude Haiti earthquake of January 2010  and the 8.8 magnitude Chilean earthquake of February 2010 . Examples of volcanic catastrophes include the destruction of Pompeii by Vesuvius  and the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens .Time. At the current rate of about 25 mm./year, the separation of the Old and New World to their present positions would take about 200 million years. To model rates of plate motion, in the 1980s, John Baumgardner used a Cray supercomputer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, USA to write a Fortran computer program called Terra. Results from using standard parameters in the equations for his model have been reported in the scientific literature.2 Baumgardner also used significantly different parameters to develop a catastrophic plate tectonic  model in collaboration with others.3The CPT model begins with the breakup of a single supercontinent, Pangaea. The edges of Pangaea then sink into the mantle at ever faster rates due to a mutually accelerating increase in heating and weakening of the mantle. This runaway subduction induces rapid reversals of the earth’s magnetic field, causes volcanic fissure eruptions, jettisons steam into the atmosphere that results in global rain, and raises the ocean floor displacing water onto the continents. The CPT model has been reported in U.S. News & World Report, with the summative statement, “Indeed, there is universal agreement that Terra, created to prove the Bible literally true, is one of the most useful and powerful geological tools in existence.”4It must be noted that this CPT model has several scientific difficulties. First, postulating rapid reversals in the whole earth’s magnetic field is problematic. Evidence is available for some rapid local changes in magnetic field,5 but explanations for rapid global changes remain hypothetical.6Pre-fossiliferous Rocks. The second problem with the CPT model is that it begins with the uni-directional rifting of Pangaea in the middle of the fossiliferous  Phanerozoic part of the geologic column. The model does not address the evidence for multi-directional plate motion in the early Phanerozoic part of the geologic record, nor in the even earlier non-fossiliferous Precambrian part. The evidence suggests that the plates moved back and forth in what are termed “Wilson cycles” rather than in just one direction7, and that most of the continental land masses were formed by plate tectonic activity during the Precambrian.Heat. Third, for the plates to move nine orders of magnitude faster , the mantle viscosity  must be a billion times smaller than at present. Since viscosity varies exponentially with temperature, this decreased viscosity would be possible only if the mantle temperature were hundreds of degrees greater than at present; however, the higher temperatures would be expected to yield different types of rocks.Fourth, and perhaps most problematic, heat from all the magma must be dissipated quickly — again, about a billion times faster than at present. This difficulty has been noted from the standard scientific perspective,8 as well as by Baumgardner himself.9 His response is: “the Flood catastrophe cannot be understood or modeled in terms of time-invariant laws of nature. Intervention by God in the natural order during and after the catastrophe appears to be a logical necessity. Manifestations of the intervention appear to include … a loss of thermal energy afterward.”The pros and cons of the CPT model have been debated in the creationist literature by Baumgardner and Oard.10 Walter Brown has hypothesized an alternative theory, which suggeststhat the pre-flood earth’s crust was ruptured by the considerable amount of water under it. The escaping water covered the earth and the broken pieces of crust formed hydroplates that rapidly slid to the location of what are now the continents.11 Sam Carey’s much older expanding-earth model has also been analyzed for its merits and problems.12 My conclusion is that plate tectonic theory seems to be well-founded, but the science does not fit easily with a recent one-year flood.As is the case in many other areas of human investigation, when we study origins issues, we must trust the details to an all-wise God, since His “foolishness” is greater than our wisdom (1 Cor 1:25ff). God has a thousand means at his disposal to bring about things of which we know nothing -- with God all things are possible (Matt. 19:26; Luke 18:27). Scientists can continue to ask questions, but like Job, must continue fully to trust God in the process (see Job 13:15).'}, {'title': 'Catastrophic Earth Science: A Realistic Science', 'author': 'Roberto E. Biaggi', 'doc': 'It is very interesting to note that during the 18th and 19th centuries, the so-called \\'catastrophist\\' or \\'diluvialist\\' earth scientists, working under a \\'catastrophist\\' paradigm, conducted their geological science in a most ideal way even though modeled by religious beliefs: they practiced a natural science, whereby, in Agassiz’ view, scientists would learn the lesson that nature has to teach (Baker 1998:179).This view was replaced after the advancements of Hutton and Lyell with the principle of uniformitarianism—the idea that processes in the past occurred at the same rates as they do in the present . This principle became so prominent and dominant in the geological community that geologists became accustomed to rejecting any hypothesis that included processes of a cataclysmic nature. This opposition continued well into the 1960s when scientists came to accept that many features in the rocks of the Channeled Scablands of the Pacific NW could be explained by an \"outrageous hypothesis\" proposed by Harlen Bretz in the 1920s: the occurrence of a cataclysmic megaflood, the Spokane Flood.According to Baker : \"Uniformitarianism is a regulative principle or doctrine in geology that unfortunately sometimes conflates  the pragmatic application of modern process studies to understanding the past  with  substantive presumptions that deny effectiveness to cataclysmic events. As recognized by William Whewell, who invented the term, meaning b is contrary to the logic of science\".  In Baker\\'s view, the stronghold of uniformitarianism on the geologic community has hindered the advancement of science.The eventual acceptance of Bretz\\'s hypothesis resulted in a resurgence of geological catastrophism , and in the last decades there has been a trend in allowing catastrophes into geological explanations. Examples of catastrophic features include recognition of well-documented megaflood events ; recognition of turbidites ; rapid accumulation of rhythmites—layers of sedimentary rock laid down with an obvious periodicity—which were previously interpreted as result of slow multiyear deposition or attributed to yearly seasonal deposition, such as varves ; the influence of large-scale volcanism in rapid burial events ; the large-scale effects of bolide impacts—a meteor that hits Earth . One must keep in mind that the fossil record is embedded in rock units possessing these features, showing that the fossils accumulated in catastrophic conditions.Associated with this evidence of rapid geological activity are many non-uniformitarian features, such as large-scale sedimentary processes ; global distribution of marine rocks ; continent-scale patterns of paleocurrents ; discontinuities in the stratigraphic record, such as paraconformities—gaps in the record with no apparent evidence for the amount of time supposedly represented; large scale volcanism ; global/regional tectonic events ; bolide impacts—more than 175 structures of possible extraterrestrial impact origin since the Precambrian, some of which measure up to 250-300 kilometers in diameter . In addition we can include many evidences that relate to the preservation of fossil remains .Perhaps it is time for present-day geologists to return to practicing a more natural science, a realistic science, not an actualistic one, in which research is led through coherence and consistency of observation with hypothesis, even if it were an\"outrageous hypothesis\" such as a global planetary flood of the likes reported in ancient history.Roberto BiaggiFebruary 14, 2013Baker, V.R.  1998.

Brand', 'doc': 'In the last two centuries catastrophism has had its ups and downs in the scientific world of geology.At the time of Charles Lyell and before, many geologists explained geological history in catastrophist terms: geological processes were often described as rapid and cataclysmic.  Some of these geologists derived their catastrophist ideas at least partly from the Bible.  Others who did not introduce biblical ideas into their science also saw evidence for catastrophic processes in the rocks.Lyell’s geological synthesis did not allow catastrophist explanations, but maintained that geological processes were uniformly slow and gradual.  His gradualist view of geological history held sway for a century, until the paradigm-challenging work of independent thinking geologist J. Harlen Bretz.Bretz’s research on the Channeled Scablands in eastern Washington State finally broke down the strong bias against catastrophic geological explanations, and now the reality of meteorite impacts and other catastrophes are accepted by mainline science.In this note we will consider the current balance between Lyell and Bretz in geological interpretations.  Has geology gone back to pre-Lyellian catastrophist views, or to what extent is catastrophic thinking still banned?The reality of catastrophic events like impacts of extra-terrestrial objects, floods like the Spokane Flood in the scablands, and major storms are recognized and accepted.  In fact it is common for geological deposits to be interpreted as a record produced by major storms or other significant, even rapid processes, while it is assumed that the record of more normal, slow processes have been mostly removed by erosion, leaving little or no record.  The hypothesized sediments that have been removed are needed because there is not nearly enough sediment to account for the millions of years of geological time.  This interpretation is the accepted one, even if adequate evidence for those multiple erosion events is lacking.  There certainly are plenty of erosional unconformities in the rocks, but not nearly enough to account for the lacking sediment.I suggest that at least two types of hypotheses should routinely be compared and evaluated when interpreting the rocks.  One category includes the view described above, with long series of erosional events that have left no record, while the other category of hypotheses accepts the visible evidence as sufficient to indicate a much shorter series of depositional and erosional events.  In other words, the second view suggests that perhaps what we see is a record of reality – the geological record has been much more rapid and catastrophic than is generally believed.  Why should these two possibilities not be openly considered and evaluated against the existing evidence?As science currently functions, that open comparison is often ruled out, because the second category may eliminate the long time periods necessary for large-scale evolution processes to occur.  Of course it also goes against the radiometric time scale.  But what if our interpretations of radiometric phenomena are not correct?  Some of the geological evidence suggests that, if we accept the evidence at face value.To consider a much more rapid, catastrophic geological past challenges the naturalistic origin of life and of major categories of life forms.  Do we want to know if that naturalistic interpretation is really correct or not?  As scientists, are we open to consider what really happened in the past, or are we satisfied to limit our explanations to fit a pre-determined set of assumptions?One likely response to this suggestion is that a theory of more rapid, catastrophic geological history has no chance of success.  If that is really true, than those who advocate the long, naturalistic view have nothing to lose by allowing active research under a more catastrophist theory.  In fact such an active research effort would only strengthen the more naturalistic view by documenting the lack of rapid geological processes.  On the other hand, based on my personal faith commitments and my experience in geological research, I predict that a theory of geology that is open to more significant catastrophism, and a shorter time for the Phanerozoic will, in the long run, be the more successful one, that will explain more of the geological evidence.  A successful scientific theory is expected to make predictions of discoveries that will result from the theory, so we will see what the future of this prediction will be.Leonard Brand, PhDLoma Linda University'}, {'title': 'Megabreccia and Catastrophe', 'author': 'Arthur V. Chadwick', 'doc': 'On a recent trip to Peru I encountered this huge rock , miles from the nearest potential source. How did it get here? What kinds of processes were involved? How fast was it moving? These and other questions re-awakened my interest in megabreccias, deposits containing huge rocks  whose transport would require catastrophic processes on a scale  unknown to us today. Earlier, I published an article in the journal Origins [5:39-46 ] on megabreccias. This article details examples of megabreccias of truly immense proportions, ranging from car-sized rocks to rocks a hundred kilometers in length. Such phenomena, spectacular as they seem, are not rare. They can be seen on every continent and even some oceanic islands such as Timor in Indonesia, where blocks approach a kilometer in length. The largest rock  of which I am aware is a monstrous clast emplaced in a deposit in Saudi Arabia. The rock (or mountain!) is 1 kilometer thick and covers an area of 1600 square kilometers. All current efforts to explain the movement of these blocks of rock for many tens of kilometers are laughable. Generally either a glacier is invoked or some kind of a gradient to slide the rocks. But clearly something else must have been involved.What kind of process could bring the huge Peruvian clast, along with millions of others larger and smaller in the megabreccia deposit where this rock resides? An answer may not be too difficult to develop, since the Andes are only a few tens of kilometers distant. If the Andes arose rapidly, on a catastrophic time scale, such deposits would be the natural consequence, as broken and fragmented rocks were liberated during the uplift process. Moving under the influence of gravity and rapid tectonics and in the company of a slurry of volcanic ash and water, their transport and deposit to the present site could easily be understood. However, if the uplift of the Andes took place over millions of years, rock fragments resulting from the gradual uplift would be reduced to clay long before they could accumulate to be transported en masse for tens of kilometers to the coastal plains.But what about the movement of the much bigger clasts mentioned in the article and above? How do you move a mass that weighs 5 trillion tons for many kms? How do you turn a 200 square kilometer slab of limestone upside down, or transport it for over 100 kms? Not by slow incremental processes over 20 million years, as the authors infer. That 20 million years is enough time by some estimates to erode all of north America to base level. The entire slab would have eroded away long before 20 million years were up. Catastrophe is the only answer that makes sense. If more and more processes in geology require invoking catastrophe, we should not be surprised, since our view of earth history predicts as much. That should encourage us to keep looking.Art Chadwick, PhDSouthwestern Adventist University'}, {'title': 'Climbing Up and Down Through the Fossil Record', 'author': 'Ariel A. Roth', 'doc': '     Doesn’t the order of fossils in rock layers demonstrate evolution from simple to complex organisms? With invertebrates the data are ambiguous; the best case for increasing complexity can be made with vertebrate fossils and plants. However, there are other valid interpretations more consistent with the Biblical record and patterns of fossil appearance.\\r\\n     First let’s review the data; rare microscopic organisms are found in the lowest rock layers, called Precambrian. Fish, amphibians, and coal forming plants dominate in the Paleozoic layers just above. Higher up one finds reptiles, including dinosaurs, in the Mesozoic, while flowering plants and mammals are relatively abundant in the top Cenozoic layers.\\r\\n     While some types of fossils, like some filamentous algae and brachiopods, are found throughout the layers, the seeming increase in complexity of vertebrate animal fossils, as one ascends in successively higher rock layers, is considered by many scientists as very strong evidence for evolutionary advancement over billions of years. This view is in sharp contrast with the biblical account of God creating the various forms of life in six days (Genesis 1 and 2; Exodus 20:8-11, 31:16-18) a few thousand years ago, followed by the Genesis Flood . The Flood may account for much of the fossil record as well or better than evolution over billions of years. There are serious problems for the evolutionary model, such as the absence of fossil intermediates between the major animal and plant groups, but the increase in complexity of vertebrates and plants as one ascends the fossil record challenges the Flood as an explanation. How can one reconcile increasing complexity with the biblical account of beginnings?\\r\\nMany years ago, Edwin Cope suggested a trend towards evolution creating increasingly larger organisms. Some creationists have suggested that this general increase in size within the fossil record might be due to a greater motility of larger organisms during the Genesis flood which helped them escape to higher locations before being buried in higher layers of mud that turned to rock preserving them as fossils. Flotation factors may also facilitate sorting of some animals and plants. A particularly intriguing theory suggests that the sequence of the fossils reflects the distribution of organisms before the Flood. In this Ecological Zonation Theory , the first organisms buried by the Flood lived at the lowest levels, and as the Floodwaters gradually rose, organisms living at higher and higher regions were gradually buried. Hence, the fossil sequence reflects the altitudinal distribution of organisms in the world before the Flood .\\r\\nThe EZT model does not propose a distribution of organisms on the earth that is identical to the present. Implicitly, it must accommodate the much greater variety of basic kinds of organisms found in the fossil record relative to those now living. Dinosaurs are an example and according to EZT they lived in the mid-altitudinal levels . Also, marine fossil distribution suggests more seas at different levels than at present. Mammals and flowering plants dominated in the upper levels, possibly kept there by competition from other kinds of organisms at lower levels or by climatic factors. It needs to be kept in perspective that in a complicated worldwide Flood one would expect that several other factors besides EZT would affect the deposition order of organisms, but EZT provides a framework consistent with the generally observed fossil sequence.\\r\\nIn the EZT, the fossil microorganisms of the deep layers  do not represent the first forms of evolving life as evolutionists propose; they are simply the tiny microorganisms that normally live in deep rocks which later became fossilized. The sudden appearance, without evolutionary intermediates, of the major marine animal phyla in the lower Paleozoic  represent fauna of the lowest seas before the flood, and the sudden appearance of land organisms higher up  are from the lowest pre-Flood dry land. In the context of the EZT, as we consider fossil microorganisms in the deepest rocks, fossils of marine organisms higher up, and terrestrial organisms still higher, we have a real sequence of advancement as we go up through the fossils, but it is not due to millions of years of gradual evolution, it is what would be expected from the Genesis Flood.\\n\\nThere is significant scientific data consistent with the biblical record of history, EZT represents one scientific theory that seems to explain historical data from the Bible and data from paleontology thought to challenge the Biblical record.\\r\\n'}, {'title': 'The Enigmatic Geologic Column', 'author': 'L. James Gibson', 'doc': 'The geologic column contains so many puzzling features that the word enigmatic comes to mind. Sudden disappearances of numerous taxa  are an example. What process could cause the global disappearance of the dinosaurs, plesiosaurs and ammonites, but not wipe out the mammals, crocodiles or frogs? Another example is the sudden appearance in the Cambrian of all the major groups of durably skeletonized marine invertebrates, except the bryozoans. Why the bryozoans? A third example is the non-random stratigraphic distribution of storm deposits. The number of storm deposits is relatively high in the lower Paleozoic, then declines in the upper Paleozoic and Triassic, then increases again in the Jurassic and Cretaceous. What accounts for such a pattern? Numerous other examples could be given.Given the complexities of the geologic column, it may be no surprise that creationists have a diversity of views on how the column relates to the Biblical flood. Many attempts have been made, including a paper by Wise and Snelling published in this journal in 2005. The present issue of Origins contains an article with a different viewpoint on the flood, and a few comments might be in order. First, publication in Origins does not necessarily reflect endorsement of either view by the , but is intended to help foster discussion. Second, it is hoped that discussion of a diversity of viewpoints will help to identify points that merit additional exploration and encourage further study. Third, exchange of ideas from different viewpoints may stimulate new ideas previously not considered.Differences of opinion in relating the geologic column to the Biblical flood reflect some rather severe deficiencies in our knowledge. First, since the geologic column represents prehistory, explaining it is a historical question rather than an experimental question. It is not that experiments cannot contribute to our understanding, but we cannot know whether our experiments are accurate replicates of the events in question. Interpreting historical events depends more on post hoc explanation than on experiment.A second problem is we do not have any good idea of what the world was like before the Flood. We do not know how the continents and oceans were arranged on the globe, nor do we know how living organisms were distributed. Were deep ocean basins and continents dispersed around the earth? Or were there only one or two deep ocean basins, with most of the surface covered with granitic rocks, much of them covered with epicontinental seas? Numerous other possibilities come to mind. Were living organisms distributed in global life zones that extended around the world? Or were they, as in modern zoos, organized in separate regions – “dinosaurland,” “marsupial land,” etc? The possibilities are almost endless, and we do not know either the important patterns or the details.A third problem is our lack of knowledge about the nature of geological processes before the Flood. Were there earthquakes and tsunamis before the great Flood? How much sediment accumulated in the ocean before the Flood? Were there local floods? What about volcanoes? Many of us are inclined to doubt such things occurred before the flood, but we really do not know. Leonard Brand’s article challenges to re-consider whether our assumptions are justified.A fourth major difficulty in attempting to decipher the geologic column in the context of a global catastrophe is our lack of knowledge about the sequence of events during the Flood. Was the onset of the Flood sudden and global? Was it sudden and local at first, gradually encompassing the entire world? Some creationists have concluded that the Flood began with a huge “bang” in which the greatest intensity of violence occurred at the beginning:In the 600th year of Noah’s life, in the 2nd month, on the 17th day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened (Genesis 7:11).But does this text justify the conclusion that the violence of the flood was greatest on the first day of the Flood? Consider Genesis 11:18, 19:The waters prevailed and increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the waters. And the waters prevailed so mightily upon the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered. Another text suggests great violence at the end of the flood:And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided (Genesis 8:1).Who can say with certainty whether the greatest violence occurred when the fountains of the deep opened, or when the waters prevailed over all the high mountains, or when the wind blew so hard it caused the waters to subside? Or who can say with certainty that there were not other major events that occurred during the flood? For example, the sediments of the geologic column record more than 150 impacts of extraterrestrial objects, yet they are not mentioned in the Biblical account of the flood.A fifth major difficulty with understanding the geologic column is that we have no modern analogue of a global catastrophe. A global flood is not necessarily merely a scaled-up version of a local flood. A globally rising sea might produce effects never observed in historical times. A global ocean could have currents of over two hundred kilometers per hour. Such speeds could have unexpected effects because the volume and grain size of the sediment load carried by water is directly related to the speed of the flow. Moreover, a globe completely covered by water might have patterns of oceanic currents drastically different from those in our modern ocean basins, which are bounded by continents.The potential role of the supernatural is another challenge to relating the geologic column to the flood. Science is generally considered to restrict itself to the study of events and processes regulated by the ordinary rules of nature. It does not consider the possibility of supernatural events or processes. Yet the global flood seems to have been supernaturally caused, so we need more than materialistic science to understand it. Even if God used physical processes to destroy the earth, He may have caused a series of specific events that we cannot infer from the results because we would not expect them to occur spontaneously. This places another difficulty in our pathway toward understanding the geologic column and its relationship to the flood.Our incomplete knowledge of the details of the geologic column is a seventh problem for attempts to understand the flood and the geologic column. What geologic evidence is buried out of reach in the earth? What evidence has been subducted beneath the crust? How complete is our knowledge of the fossils preserved in the sediments? These and many other questions remind us that our hypotheses are tenuous at best.These factors, and undoubtedly others as well, complicate all efforts to correlate the geologic column with the flood. Because our knowledge is so incomplete, we sometimes find it useful to make certain assumptions and then follow the implications of these assumptions to build ideas of earth history. These ideas may potentially be tested against both Scripture and observation.The use of assumptions is especially important in interpreting the past. Leonard Brand cautions us against depending on old assumptions. He suggests there may have been significant geological activity before the flood and proposes how one might compare that idea with evidence in the rocks. Wise and Snelling’s paper utilized a number of assumptions regarding the flood, leading to their suggestion that a particular stratigraphic horizon in the Grand Canyon might represent the first sediments deposited by the flood. Making assumptions and proposing interpretations are legitimate processes in science, but the measure of progress is whether such exercises lead to broader explanations and better predictions. Both papers point to the need for additional study by those who wish to decipher the puzzles of the enigmatic geologic column.'}, {'title': 'Wholistic Geology: Geology Before, During, and After the Biblical Flood', 'author': 'Leonard R. Brand', 'doc': 'Traditional flood geology theory interprets much or all of the Phanerozoic part of the geologic column as formed during the one year of the biblical flood. Some geological and paleontological data are, in my opinion, difficult to explain in this theory. Wholistic geology endeavors to explain more of the earth science data while remaining true to a literal understanding of biblical creation and a global flood. In this view, geological processes such as erosion and sedimentation begin soon after creation or the entrance of sin, and continue for several thousand years. This time interval includes a literal global flood as described in Genesis, but this event did not produce as much of the Phanerozoic record as in traditional flood geology theory.After the rise of Darwinism in the mid 19th century, George McCready Price was a prominent pioneer in developing a flood theory of geology. In his theory the flood explained all geological phenomena. He rejected glaciation and the presumed stratigraphic order of the fossils. Price was convinced that this evolutionary sequence of fossils was an unsubstantiated device of the evolutionists to support their theory. Whitcomb & Morris’s book The Genesis Flood  presented much of Price’s flood theory in a way that caught the attention of a significant portion of the Christian world and brought flood geology into prominence .Harold Clark followed closely in Price’s footsteps for a time, but Clark spent time in field study and recognized weaknesses in Price’s concepts. Clark decided there was indeed a time of more intense glaciation in the Pleistocene, and the fossils really do occur in a predictable sequence in the fossil record. In order to explain how this sequence could be produced by a global flood he proposed his ecological zonation theory . According to this theory, all basic types of created animals and plantswere alive at the beginning of the flood, and they were killed and buried in a sequence determined by the ecological zone in which they lived. As the flood waters rose, low elevation ecological zones were destroyed first, and successive higher elevation zones were affected in turn. This has become the standard explanation for many believers in a literal flood.As we look more closely at the details of the geologic record it becomes more difficult to reconcile the evidence with Clark’s theory. Not only the sequence of fossils, but current scientific interpretations of many geological phenomena also are a challenge to this theory. Examples include features at many levels in the geologic column that each take time to develop, such as reefs, fossil hard grounds , and tidal cycles in sediments. It is my purpose here to propose some modifications to traditional thinking that could lead to an improvement in our understanding of the Flood.TOWARD A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF THE FLOOD AND THE GEOLOGIC COLUMNI begin the search by summarizing the concepts that we can derive from Scripture. I choose to accept the events in Genesis as literal events . The following is my list of biblical anchor points:1. A literal creation week of seven consecutive, 24-hour days.2. At the end of creation week, Earth contained a variety of plants and animals, including invertebrates, fish, reptiles, mammals, birds, and trees, including at least some that are considered to be the more “highly evolved” types such as humans and fruit trees .3. The creation week occurred only a few thousand years ago. There are uncertainties about the completeness of genealogical lists and differences between ancient biblical manuscripts, but although we do not know the exact time span, I conclude that Scripture clearly portrays a short history of life on Earth.4. Sometime since the creation there was a catastrophic flood of global proportions. Noah and his family and representatives of the terrestrial vertebrates survived in an ark, while the others died in the flood.Most creationists have been guided by a fifth point: the geologic column was mostly deposited by the global flood. However, this is not based on any Biblical teaching, and it may be time to reconsider the relationship between the Biblical flood and the geologic column. Perhaps there could have been significant geological activity before the Flood, as well as after it. Thus, I propose a fifth principle to be considered:5. There may have been extensive geological activity before and after the Flood. The geologic column contains fossil and sediments produced by the Flood, and also those produced by processes acting before and after the Flood.I propose this approach, incorporating point 5 above, be called “wholistic geology”, in contrast with “flood geology”, since it attempts to explain the geologic column by taking into account potential geological activity during the whole history of the earth rather than restricting it to only the Biblical year of the flood. Others have also begun to think in similar terms .HYPOTHESES TO CONSIDER IN DEVELOPING A WHOLISTIC GEOLOGY THEORY At present I do not believe that we have a satisfactory understanding of how to relate the geologic record or its fossils to the biblical flood. Before we can do so there seems to be need for a better theory of what might have happened, geologically, throughout history since creation. Then we must seek ways to test our theories, and finally, practical field research to do the testing and to feed back into an improved theory of geological history.The development of theories of geological history consistent with Scripture must be based on sound geological evidence. It should involve original field research specifically designed to test concepts of the theory and find criteria for accepting or rejecting various ideas.As a starting point for developing an alternative flood theory, the following ideas are suggested elements of a theory that includes significant geological activity between creation and the flood, and after the flood. This article is not presenting a detailed theory, but suggests a different set of parameters for developing a theory. These ideas can be helpful as long as we do not become too attached to them. This is not a theory to be defended, but a suggestion of an approach to the study of geological history that could lead in time to an alternative theory, that can be fruitfully compared with more traditional geological theories. Chamberlin’s concept of multiple working hypotheses  is very useful, especially in the initial phases of evaluating which direction to go in our theorizing. The following points are intended as a basis for developing one of the possibilities. \\xa01. Perhaps processes forming the Phanerozoic record began soon after sin, and continued to the present day.2. Perhaps during the hundreds of years before Noah’s trip, a part of the geologic record formed in the ocean basins and lowland areas not inhabited by humans. This is supported by the fact that some of our modern continents are largely covered by Paleozoic marine sediments, indicating they were lowland basins before the flood . These basins were largely occupied by shallow oceans and nearshore environments, and it is not clear where the preflood continents were. This may seem extreme, but if our present continents were originally covered by ocean, how could the people and other terrestrial plants and animals have been living there? They had to be somewhere else. The basaltic rocks forming modern ocean basins are no older than about Jurassic time, so we are not sure what occupied that area before Jurassic time. Perhaps there were some type of continents in these parts of Earth.The time available for this would be up to about 1500 years if the time span since creation was roughly 6,000 years. If the time since creation was closer to 10,000 years, the time for “preflood” geological processes could be up to 5,000 years, or the time since the flood could be longer than we have thought.3. There was a global flood as described in Genesis. Some dramatic change took place at that time, destroying the inhabited parts of Earth, in a process involving Divine activity, very different from normal earth processes. Perhaps that dramatic change involved the breakup of part of Earth’s crust, with rapid subduction of old continental areas (ala Baumgardner? ), or loss of continental area by some other process. If this destruction of the continental areas inhabited by humans was rather complete, then it may be difficult to find or to recognize evidence for this subduction event.Is it possible that continents could be subducted into the mantle? It seems that this would require that preflood continents were different in composition from modern continents. Continents now have a foundation of granitic rock, which is too light to sink down into the denser basaltic material under them. One possibility is that at least some of the original continents were of basaltic material, but with abundant pore spaces for water movement, resulting in a net specific gravity lower than solid basaltic rock. A continent of this composition would be light enough to stay above the ocean water level, but if the water system collapsed so that it became solid basalt, it could then be subducted into the mantle.Another option to consider is that the original parts of continents occupied by upland terrestrial ecosystems, including humans, were located in parts of our continents that are now called shields. These are areas that have no rocks younger than Precambrian. Northeast Canada and a large part of Greenland compose one of these shields. Are there other possibilities that we have not thought of, that should be considered?4. After that major crisis, the earth was again stable enough to support life, but much catastrophic action continued as crustal plates moved to their current positions and the crust gradually reached a new equilibrium. This period of readjustment after the flood produced the more recent part of the geologic record, over a time period of hundreds to perhaps a few thousands of years.5. Portions of the fossil record, before and since the flood, may have accumulated slowly enough for evolution within lower taxonomic levels to occur, and to be recorded in the fossil record. Possible examples of this could be the series of species of trilobites in successive units of Cambrian rocks, or ammonite species in successive ammonite zones in Cretaceous sediments. This suggests that microevolution and speciation can occur within created groups much faster that most scientists believe possible, especially when environments are changing rapidly  . One difficulty with this idea is that so often species appear in the fossil record with no intermediates linking them to ancestral species. Also we need to determine if there is a portion of the fossil record that does not have any such succession of species, and if this represents the flood.6. The sequence in the fossil record resulted from a combination of  changes in the ecological zones affected at various times (a sort of stretched out version of ecological zonation. This may be more realistic than Clark’s version, since the less catastrophic processes in the wholistic geology theory might be less likely to mix organisms from very different habitats),  actual microevolution and speciation within created groups as organisms adapted to changes in water chemistry, temperature, plant associations, etc.,  migration of organisms and perhaps competitive replacement of some groups, and  die-offs occurring as changing ecological conditions  reached successive crisis points for different groups of organisms.The theory built on the concepts listed above is called the wholistic geology theory, because it incorporates a wider range of information than other geology theories. It includes the biblical global flood, and the possibility of extensive geological action before and after that flood. All the available geologic data are utilized in developing the theory, while also gaining insights from biblical constraints. This results in suggestions for new research to test this new theory. Part of this research will be done in areas where there are unresolved conflicts between conventional geology and biblical insights, and in some cases this analysis makes predictions as to what the findings of new research will ultimately be.COMPARING WHOLISTIC GEOLOGY WITH CURRENT DOMINANT THEORIESWholistic geology can be compared  with a traditional flood theory with the Paleozoic and Mesozoic formed during the flood and the conventional long ages theory. Each has advantages and disadvantages in its consistency with the scientific and biblical data .These three theories are testable. Testing them will not happen quickly, as it will require some effort to develop better ideas of just what processes would be involved in a wholistic geology theory. But some basic aspects of the theories can be tested even now, with good field work. One definite advantage of considering new options, e.g., a wholistic geology theory, for comparison with the traditional flood theory is that we are not boxed in by unnecessary constraints. If we make the extrabiblical assumption that all fossil-bearing geological deposits began at the flood, then there are many situations where we have no choice but to interpret entire rock formations as deposited in hours, days, or a few months at most. However, if we are comparing two or more theories, like the traditional flood theory and the wholistic geology theory, we can open-mindedly evaluate  whether each rock formation was deposited within hours-months, or whether they each took many years  to form.Of course if we remain within a time frame of thousands, rather than millions, of years, this still requires the prediction that there are entirely new interpretations needed for some geological processes. That is true even for those who prefer a longer time frame, like a few hundred thousand years, and the data available to us from scientific study may not be able to establish whether it was <10,000 years or >100,000 years anyway , so I hope that all who care about the Genesis account can work together on this, no matter just what time frame we believe is best.PREDICTIONS OF THE THEORY A theory, including the one proposed here, is only useful if it encourages research that improves our understanding of the subject. A useful scientific theory will make predictions of what will be discovered if the theory is correct. If these predictions stimulate discovery through research that would likely not have been done otherwise, the theory has become a productive scientific theory.The traditional flood theory and wholistic geology theory each make predictions, many of which should be testable by field research. The following list includes examples of general predictions or conclusions, and they could be subdivided into more specific, testable, predictions. Further study will no doubt generate additional types of predictions.Predictions following from any type of short age geology theory : Predictions following from a wholistic geology theory, in addition to those listed above: There are not many additional predictions, beyond those listed above.QUALITATIVE PRELIMINARY TESTS OF THE POWER OF WHOLISTIC GEOLOGY TO EXPLAIN RATES OF GEOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES The wholistic geology theory allows more time for explaining some geological and paleontological phenomena than a traditional flood theory that requires much of the record to be formed in one year. Several thousand years is three orders of magnitude more than one year, and there is a big difference in what can occur during those two different time periods. The following discussion lists several of the important types of evidence pertinent to questions of time, with some preliminary analysis .Methods are needed for testing between different biblical hypotheses of geologic history. The following lines of evidence will then be utilized in proposing such tests.Sedimentation rates As Sadler  pointed out, there does not seem to be nearly as much sediment in the geologic column as is expected from modern sedimentation rates. The wholistic geology theory proposed here gives an explanation for that observation. Ancient rates of sedimentation in Sadler’s graph were determined by measuring thickness of sediment between radiometrically dated units . The wholistic geology theory proposes that radiometric processes do not give a true measure of time, at least for the Phanerozoic, and the average rates of geological processes in the past were much faster than shown in the graph in .If the thickness of sediment present in the geologic column is measured , and compared with Sadler’s graph in . This should probably be increased to up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than modern rates, because in some places the sediment is much thicker than the average of 1,500-2,000 m.This is possibly realistic, and probably rather conservative, if my impression is correct that at least some  of the Phanerozoic rocks were deposited by more rapid processes than we observe today. This is, however, a very preliminary way of looking at sedimentation rates. We do not really know what was happening without a comprehensive analysis of the effects over time of sediment supply, basin subsidence, and whether basins are draining  (Carroll & Bohacs 1999) in different areas. These are also only average rates, and do not mean that processes were occurring at steady rates. There could have been episodes of rapid sedimentation and periods of little activity. There would have been times with very catastrophic processes, especially during the year of the flood proper. However, during the rest of the time average sediment accumulation rates may have been only one or a few meters per year, and that can hardly even be considered catastrophic.It seems to me, from the literature and from my own study, that some significant types of evidence in the rocks point to rates of geological processes that are much too fast for conventional theory based on the radiometric time scale. A wholistic geology theory may come closest to explaining this, since the time frame of this theory can account for the existing sediments with geological processes that are not much faster than is observed today, even in our relatively stable earth.The following are some examples of data that do not fit conventional theory well, and may be better explained by a theory that is closer to what I am suggesting:Rates of biological change These relatively rapid geological changes and resulting ecological change might also generate faster rates of biological change. Rates of evolution observed today  are much faster than the rates calculated from the fossil record as dated by radiometric dating methods , by 7-10 orders of magnitude. Acceptance of the radiometric time scale requires one to conclude that observed modern evolutionary rates do not reflect reality  (another ad-hoc hypothesis?). However, acceptance of the wholistic geology theory would suggest that rates of biological change in the past may have been as fast, and quite possibly much faster on the average, than the rates measured today. If Earth today is more geologically and ecologically stable than it was during much of its history , it is likely that rates of evolution in the past would have been faster than today .In other words, perhaps the geologic and biological data are hard to reconcile with either alternative — most of the geologic record in a one year flood at one extreme, and millions of years at the other extreme. Real rates of geological and biological change may fit best with a time span of the order of magnitude that this proposed theory suggests.Paleontological features with time implications Stromatolites, reefs, extensive bioturbation of some sediments, fossil hard grounds, and other features of biological origin seem to require some time, but not millions of years. Stromatolites  and reefs  seem to be distributed throughout the fossil record , and this seems impossible to explain in a one-year flood . More study is needed, but it seems likely that these features can be more readily explained in the time frame of the wholistic geology theory.Carbonate sediment accumulation rates Separate from the question of whether a carbonate structure is a wave-resistant reef, is the time required to form extensive amounts of carbonate sediment that formed in situ, containing unsorted organic remains that do not appear to be transported assemblages. Ancient reefs  are usually much smaller than our biggest modern reefs , and any that did form in situ\\xa0would require some time, but perhaps they could develop in a short time frame. This needs much more study.Evaporite formation To evaluate the time required to form deposits generally interpreted as evaporites  requires that we know what was the actual mechanism that formed them. A geologic record forming in a few thousand years could explain some evaporites, but still predicts that the processes that formed some of these deposits  are not yet adequately understood. There are still aspects of these processes that are hard to understand within even a wholistic geology theory.Time to form cyclic sedimentary features Sediments with tidal cycles  may represent a time frame consistent with the theory suggested here. Discovery of these tidal cycles has changed the interpreted time for deposition of some rocks from thousands or millions of years, to a few years (e.g., Archer & Kvale 1989, Archer et al. 1995, Brown et al. 1990). This is still a challenge to a traditional flood theory, but fits well into a wholistic geology theory.Finely laminated sediments usually interpreted as varves  need more study, as this theory predicts that extensive deposits of many thousands or tens of thousands of “varves” do not represent actual annual deposits. In some cases there is already evidence that challenges the varve interpretation. For example, some deposits commonly interpreted as varves contain very abundant fossils that are exquisitely preserved . There does not seem to be an adequate explanation for how these fossils could be so well preserved unless they were buried rapidly .Sedimentary cycles are characteristic of much of the geologic record. These cycles  are very numerous in some formations. To evaluate the time implications requires that we understand the mechanisms behind these cycles. Some may be actual cycles of water level change, but other mechanisms should also be considered, including possible mechanisms not yet discovered. Turbidites were once thought to represent cycles of several years each, but are now known to form in minutes from underwater mudslides. Perhaps there are cyclic processes yet to be discovered that are quite different from turbidites, but are as undiscovered as turbidites were prior to the 1950s.Taphonomy The field of taphonomy  is producing much fascinating data. Research has shown how important rapid burial is for producing fossils, especially for well-preserved vertebrate fossils. It appears that the implications of this have not been fully explored. Many formations with superbly preserved vertebrates in large numbers  are often interpreted as accumulating very slowly, perhaps centimeters/thousand years with the fossils escaping decay because they are in anoxic water . However, experiments have refuted the hypothesis that anoxic water slows or eliminates decay. Decay is not slower in anoxic conditions, it just involves anaerobic bacteria (Plotnick 1986, Allison & Briggs 1991, Allison et al. 1991). These well-preserved fossils seem to require very rapid sediment deposition.The other side of the taphonomy data needs to be also thought about. If at least the Paleozoic and Mesozoic were deposited within a year, with systematic ecological processes killing and burying organisms, then most animals must have been buried very soon after death — within hours or days. The problem with such consistently rapid burial is that it should have preserved mostly intact, articulated specimens. However, the vertebrate fossil record  consists mostly of disarticulated, scattered bones and teeth. Most of these disarticulated remains probably required several weeks or months of decay and disarticulation before burial. Is it possible to fit that many episodes  of several months of disarticulation into a one-year Cambrian to Cretaceous process?However, if many animals were not buried quickly after their death, how could animals from different ecological zones have been killed and buried in the precise sequence that we see in the fossil record, without mixing up animals from different zones? This is a puzzle for any short age geology theory.Relationships between fossil living areas and burial sites, and amount of transport Some flood theories require that many or most organisms be transported up to thousands of kilometers to the areas where they were buried and fossilized. This concept introduces problems in explaining some fossil deposits. The wholistic geology theory may not require as much long distance transport, but this needs much more study.SUGGESTIONS FOR APPLYING WHOLISTIC GEOLOGY THEORY It seems doubtful that we can or even should try, to use science to disprove conventional geology theory and the evolution of life . Rather, our task is to develop alternate explanations for the evidence. That is always a first step for any scientific theory. These theories are unique in having been launched from a platform of faith, but if our faith is based on truth, it will point us in the right general direction. Our search for truth may at times follow a winding path as we test and refine or reject various ideas, but it will in time lead us to more satisfactory explanations for the data. As we search, the farther we get in developing a theory that is able to suggest constructive new research to be done, the more it will have promise of making real progress.What is the reason for thinking this is important? Some of us believe that Biblical revelation is reliable, even on the topic of the origin and history of life on Earth. We would be missing something if we fail to utilize these insights to steer us in productive directions in research. \\xa0I believe several things are needed at this time to make our flood theorizing efforts productive. A concerted research effort is needed to raise our prospects of success. In recent decades geology has improved its understanding of many processes, and this improved understanding is helpful to us also. And yet there are still many areas where a faith-based theory predicts that new, even radically different, processes are yet to be discovered. If we would do justice to this work, the research must be done with impeccable care and scientific rigor, benefiting whenever possible by the quality control of peer review.APPLYING THE THEORY TO SPECIFIC PROBLEMS I believe the following are examples of approaches that will be beneficial and important:This research effort would benefit from a managed science approach, in which research funding is available for research directed to the specific goals of the project.EXAMPLES – APPLICATION OF THE THEORY TO TWO SPECIFIC GEOLOGICAL FORMATIONS Eocene in the Green River Basin, Wyoming: Bridger and Green River Formations Eocene deposits in the Green River Basin of southwestern Wyoming include the Green River Fm. and the Bridger Fm. The Green River Fm.  was deposited in ancient Lake Gosiute, and the lower part of the Bridger Fm. represents the flood plain along the edges of the lake. In the concluding phase of the formation of Lake Gosiute, as usually recognized, increasing volcanic episodes from the north began to fill the lake periodically with thick packages of volcaniclastic sediment which was partly redistributed by fluvial  processes. This fluvial deposition formed most of the Bridger Fm., which extends across a significant part of the basin. The Bridger Fm. also contains a series of limestone units, representing basin-wide lakes which existed between episodes of volcanic deposition .Radiometric dates for the GRF and Bridger give a total time span of about 15 million years . The GRF contains tens of thousands of thin laminations (~ 1/10 mm thick) that are often interpreted as varves, understood as one lamination per year. The Bridger Fm. is interpreted as flood plain deposits from rivers, ponds, marshes, and periodic lakes formed over extensive time periods. The abundant turtles are assumed to have lived in the ponds and marshes, and to have died in large numbers as individual water bodies dried up.However, several lines of evidence suggest that these long time spans may not be correct. The “varved” deposits in the GRF contain millions of exquisitely preserved fossils. They are mostly fish, but there are also crocodiles, turtles, bats, palm fronds, cattails, insects, insect larvae, and a horse. The vertebrate fossils are typically complete, with bones articulated and well preserved, and the insects and plants are complete with fine details preserved. Even the abundant vertebrate coprolites  are well preserved and 3-dimensional, probably from rapid mineralization initiated by bacterial decay. Such excellent preservation speaks of rapid burial and fossilization. The traditional explanation was death and preservation in a deep, cold lake with anoxic water that prevented decay. But there is evidence that the lake was not very deep (Eugster & Surdam 1973, Surdam & Stanley 1979). Parts of the lake could have still been anoxic, but experiments have shown that anoxic water does not prevent decay or even significantly slow it down (Plotnick 1986, Allison 1988, Allison & Briggs 1991, Briggs & Kear 1994). Also, a study in a GRF site that was in shallow water at the edge of the lake has the same exquisitely preserved small fish, insects, and insect larvae, preserved in the same laminated sediments . The shallow water conditions at this site eliminate the possibility of anoxic water, and the organisms must have been buried in days, not years. Also, the complete horse skeleton and large animals like crocodiles require rapid burial to account for their preservation. In some places there are soft-sediment deformation features in which the laminated GRF was distorted vertically by many meters because of the weight of the overlying sediment. If the laminations represent one layer per year, then the sediment remained soft and un-cemented for millions of years, which seems very unlikely.In the Bridger Fm., Unit B, most turtles consist of complete or nearly complete shells, almost no skulls, and few limbs. The turtles are not spread vertically through the formation, but occur in several distinct horizons. Each turtle horizon  was a mass mortality event all across the basin, and field and experimental study of turtles  indicate the turtles were buried within a few months after their death. Each turtle bed consists of many turtles concentrated in the first few meters of mudstone above a limestone. Above that the turtles do not become more decayed and disarticulated, as we might expect if conditions changed from a mass mortality to more normal conditions. Instead, there are no turtles or extremely few turtles for the next 20-40 vertical m above that, until the next limestone. Most turtle deaths were not from slow dehydration as local ponds dried up, but from catastrophic death all across the basin of several hundred square miles, at the beginning of an episode of volcanism . The sediment above the turtle layers indicates conditions suitable for turtles, so why are there almost no turtles in the sediment above these mass mortality layers, if there was an average of 200,000 years between limestone-producing lakes? It appears more likely that there was not sufficient time between deposition of successive limestones for turtle populations to build up and produce fossils. Also, the sediment is not of a type that would require thousands or millions of years for its deposition, but could probably accumulate rapidly if there was a sufficient sediment supply and supply of flowing water to distribute it.This does not prove that the GRF and the Bridger Fm. were rapidly deposited, but the evidence cited here is difficult to explain if at least significant portions of each formation were not formed rapidly. The evidence is not compatible with the geological processes usually assumed to have produced each formation.Looking at the other side of this issue, could these formations have been deposited in a few days or weeks, as would be required if they and all the rock formations older than them were deposited in a one-year flood? Several lines of evidence do not seem compatible with that interpretation, but seem to require at least several hundred years for the GRF to form. For example, the fossils and sedimentary features in the GRF are distributed in a way that indicates an established lake ecology persisting over a significant amount of time. In the middle of the lake are large fish, and the edge of the lake contains fish fry, cattails, stromatolites, etc., as would be expected in normal living conditions. Fossil burrows of bottomdwelling animals are abundant in the sediments near the edge of the lake, but not in the middle of the lake. The nature and distribution of stromatolites is consistent with a lake that periodically expands and then shrinks, from changing water levels, with the stromatolites growing only along the shore. This occurs repeatedly at successive intervals, each stromatolite bed several meters above the previous one. \\xa0The Bridger Fm. also contains features that are consistent with a time span of perhaps a few hundred years, but not a one-year flood. The turtles in each turtle layer show evidence of several months between death and burial, because of the amount of decay and disarticulation of their skeletons. Also there are a number of stratigraphic intervals in the Bridger with abundant tufa or stromatolites, including some intervals with tufa growing on turtle shells. The turtles had time to partially disarticulate, and then tufa formed on the shells by chemical precipitation before they were buried. This would not require long ages of time, but more than a few days or weeks.The evidence discussed above, and other features of these formations, seems most consistent with a time frame of perhaps hundreds of years, rather than either of the extremes of millions of years on one hand, or a few weeks at the other extreme. Radiometric dates are the principal reason why they are interpreted as involving millions of years, but this is hard to reconcile with other lines of evidence. Attempts to explain them as part of the one-year flood seem to arise strictly from a particular religious but extra-biblical philosophical position on Earth history.Miocene/Pliocene Pisco Formation, coastal Peru Along the coast of Peru is a sequence of marine sedimentary formations and fossils, from at least Eocene to Pliocene. The Pisco Formation is part of this sequence, beginning in the Miocene and extending into the Pliocene. The accepted interpretation of the Pisco Formation involves about 5 million years for the accumulation of its sandstone and diatomaceous sediments and fossils. This scenario would indicate an average sediment accumulation rate of a few centimeters per thousand years.The Pisco Fm. contains abundant marine vertebrate fossils, including whales, porpoises, seals, ground sloths , penguins and other marine birds, turtles, bony fish and sharks. These are typically extremely well preserved, with skeletons articulated or in some cases partly disarticulated but with the bones still closely associated and well preserved. The bones show almost none of the destructive effects of chemical corrosion or burrowing by organisms that occurs quite rapidly in the modern marine environment . The fossil evidence requires burial of each animal within weeks or months at most . Also, where the sediment is well exposed there is often evidence that its deposition occurred rapidly from storms or tidal currents, not compatible with slow deposition of a few centimeters per thousand years.On the other hand, the Pisco Fm. contains evidence that requires more time than is consistent with its accumulating in a few days or weeks. The vertebrates were buried rapidly, but a number of them show evidence of at least several months of decay before burial. Many of the whales are buried in sediment that is mostly diatom skeletons. There is evidence that the diatoms multiplied rapidly in tremendous blooms offshore, and were concentrated, along with the whales, by storms and tidal currents that transported them into shallow bays where the whales sank and were buried . In spite of the unusual blooms and the concentrating currents it would take some time to produce such a large volume of diatomaceous sediment.Also there are horizons with features requiring some time for their formation. These include large colonies of small marine tube worms, up to at least two meters across and a meter thick. Such a colony forms from many generations of these very small worms building their calcareous tubes on top of the previous generation of tubes. Some smaller colonies occur on rocks that also have attached oysters and barnacles. These required time for the organisms to grow on the hard rock surfaces on the ocean bottom before burial. These same intervals have layers of phosphate nodules, which require time to form on the ocean bottom. They are accompanied also by abundant flat-pebble conglomerates formed of layers of sediment, approximately a half centimeter thick, that were abundantly burrowed by bottom-dwelling invertebrates. These pieces of burrowed sediment were ripped up by the current and transported, with their edges rounded during the transport process.The vertebrates in the Pisco Fm. show changes in size and morphological features as one goes upward in the formation. These changes indicate either some type of sorting action during the deposition process, or rapid microevolution and speciation during the time required for its accumulation, or perhaps movement during climatic changes.The primary reason why the Pisco Fm. is believed to require millions of years is radiometric dating. The sediments and fossils have features that are difficult to reconcile with this long time period. On the other hand, they also contain features that don’t seem to fit a time frame of days or weeks. Perhaps a few hundred years would be a more realistic time period for the Pisco Fm. My personal philosophy regarding the attempt to reconcile ancient history with Scripture is that it is not wise to change one’s position too readily. If a given theory of geology, e.g., is based on and consistent with Scripture but we do not know how to fit it with the scientific data, that may just reflect the lack of adequate knowledge of ancient processes and especially of how those processes may differ from our modern analogues. This is even more relevant if we have reason to think that ancient processes  were quite different from anything we have ever observed. On the other hand, if this impasse does not seem to ease up with more study, and perhaps gets worse, it may be necessary to decide there is something important missing in our theory.There are those who have done that, and have decided that we need to reinterpret Scripture to fit science as understood by the majority of scientists today. I understand their reasons for doing so, but believe there is reason for some of us to try a different approach — seeking a geologic theory consistent with a more literal understanding of Scripture that includes the global flood. I believe God knows much more about earth history than we do, and has shown a level of interest in communicating with us that is not consistent with an allegorizing of Genesis.Many puzzling questions remain. For example there were mass extinctions in both the Paleozoic and the Mesozoic. Can any of those fit into a pre-flood scenario? Can they be adequately explained by the hypothesis that these extinctions affected only oceanic environments while mammals, birds, angiosperms etc. were living on the continents, in upland areas? Other questions like these beg for answers.However, unanswered questions are not unique to wholistic geology, but exist in all geologic theories. Wholistic geology is the hypothesis that a literal one-week creation, literal global flood, short age geology theory does not require that all or most of the geologic column be placed within the one-year of the flood. This opens up other possibilities that should be carefully and prayerfully pursued and tested by comparison with the data.Even this concept will require extensive research and consideration of new ways of explaining some phenomena, different from already understood geological processes. This wholistic geology theory should be studied, not assumed to be correct, but also not rejected out of hand because it is different from what we have believed. The basic ideas presented here are not new with me, but have come from discussions and time in geology field work with various persons, representing varying philosophical perspectives, who may or may not wish to have their names associated with this topic. Most important, I am thankful that God cares enough to give us guidance to help us find our way through the challenges that some scientific interpretations present to Scripture.'}, {'title': \"Is There Biological Evidence of Life's Recent Creation?\\n\", 'author': 'Timothy G. Standish', 'doc': '\\n                \\nDuring one of my frequent visits to the office of my high school headmaster, his individual tutelage yielded a life lesson that I’ve never forgotten. His exact words were, “You think you’re right!” Of course I thought I was right, wouldn’t anyone who thought they were wrong change their mind and then immediately think they are right?\\nNow that I’m an adult biologist, I still think that I’m right. Inevitably that means I disagree with some other people’s opinions; it is the price I and they pay for being thinking human beings. I think I’m right when I believe that that astrologers can’t tell the future, that priests can’t create the actual body and blood of Christ during the Mass and that geologists can’t really know with certainty that life has existed on Earth for billions of years.\\nWhen it comes to the age of life, no human was there to actually see it created, so we have to rely on our interpretation of the evidence. Interestingly, there is one eyewitness account, written in stone by the witness Himself. The 4th Commandment in Exodus 20 and 31 records what God wrote with his own finger: “ for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed” (Exodus 31:17 NKJV). That may not tell us the exact date of the creation, but it does clear up any reasonable question about how long it took, at least according to God.\\nThere is evidence in the Bible of when the creation occurred. It involves adding up the age at which fathers had children and figuring out a reasonable starting point to count back from. In addition, there are things like the genealogy of Jesus stretching all the way back to Adam (Luke 3:23-38) which tie into the more ancient genealogies. Scholars have figured out lots of different ways of adding the numbers, but those who stick with things like logic and data find it difficult to get a biblical creation date more than a few thousand years ago.\\nDo I as a biologist think that the scientific data point in the same direction? The simple answer is yes. I know, this is tantamount to heresy among those who believe they have it right that life is billions of years old; but when I look at the most informative data most carefully, I see that the scientific evidence, at least in my field, is quite consistent with the biblical record. If you want to know how old something is, first of all you should look at it. The right place to start when investigating when life came into existence, is by looking at living things.\\nSo, let’s look at 5 lines of evidence from living (and dead) things to see what they suggest about how old life is. Let’s start with dinosaurs, because everyone knows they are cool and that they lived tens of millions of years ago… except for me and some others who are looking at the evidence they have left behind.\\nEvidence 1-Ancient biomolecules[1]\\nDinosaur bones embedded in sediment; scale is 40 cm long. Dinosaur Ridge, CO, USA.Dr. Mary Schweitzer did something that anyone who knew about fossil dinosaurs wouldn’t have done. She took a fragment of dinosaur bone and put it into a solution that dissolved away the minerals. This is similar in principle to the classic experiment of putting a chicken bone in vinegar. When the mineral component of the bone is dissolved in the vinegar, the protein component is left behind and you can tie the bone in a knot without breaking it. The problem with what Dr. Schweitzer did is that everyone knows that there could be no protein component left in dinosaur bones because proteins don’t last for tens of millions of years.\\nProteins, DNA and other big biological molecules are broken by water, oxygen and other chemicals. In addition, they are broken by radiation and, while there isn’t much radiation over the course of a day, over the course of millions of years it really adds up. At least in theory, there should be no protein in dinosaur bones if they are tens of millions of years old. Of course, theory isn’t the same as observation, but when we study modern bones, their proteins break down. Presumably proteins in bones broke down in the past as well.\\nKnowing that there should not be proteins in dinosaur bones, you can hardly imagine the shock when Dr. Schweitzer reported that there was abundant protein in her dinosaur bone samples. The most reasonable explanation would seem to be that the bones are not millions of years old. However, some scientists, including Dr. Schweitzer, have suggested that maybe proteins are preserved in the presence of iron, or when they are associated with the mineral part of bone material. These explanations seem quite optimistic. In addition, it isn’t just protein that has been found associated with fossils, other biological molecules have also been found and I, along with some colleagues, have accumulated hundreds of papers about this from the peer reviewed scientific literature. At least from my perspective as a biologist, suggesting that proteins and other biological molecules have lasted for tens of millions of years is equivalent to claiming a miracle. It is surprising enough that they could have lasted thousands of years buried in the ground.\\nEvidence 2-Mutations[2]\\nEvery now and then, the chemical letters in DNA molecules are changed. These changes are called mutations and they may be caused by chemical damage to DNA, viral infections, radiation or errors in copying DNA. Mutations are a problem, because DNA contains the recipes for how, when and where to make the proteins in our bodies. Randomly change the recipes and things can go very wrong.\\nThe good thing is that the information encoded in our DNA is remarkably robust, so most of the time, mutations don’t kill us, at least immediately. When a mutation is really bad, generally the person with it dies, so it isn’t passed on to their children. But what about those mutations that are just a little bit negative, but don’t kill you? These are called “near neutral” mutations and, while they don’t immediately kill people, they are not weeded out by natural selection and so they accumulate in human’s DNA.\\nThere are different estimates of how fast mutations are accumulating, but commonly they run above 100 mutations per person per generation. It is good thing that most mutations are near neutral, but they are still thought to have a small cumulative negative effect. At our current mutation rate, eventually, the recipes for the vital proteins in our bodies will inevitably be corrupted to the point that we can’t survive.\\nHumans are thought to be in something called “error catastrophe,” which means that we are mutating so fast that the human race can’t last forever. The same is probably true for other organisms. So, if we can’t last forever, how long can we last? Time will tell, but millions of years seems way too optimistic. It thus seems depressingly obvious that humans and other organisms probably haven’t been around for millions of years and are unlikely to last too many thousands of years longer. Even unbelievers should be hoping that Jesus comes soon and does a new creation; otherwise, we have little hope for the future.\\nEvidence 3-Improbable hybridizations[3]\\nA London plane tree, thought to have originated from hybridization between Platanus occidentalis and Platanus orientalis. Kew Gardens, England.A gardener working in the Oxford Botanical Gardens around 1670 AD, noticed some tree saplings coming up that he had never seen before. It turned out that these new trees were the result of hybridization between American sycamore trees, Platanus occidentalis, and oriental plane trees, Platanus orientalis, whose native range extends from the Balkans to Iran.\\nThis may not seem impressive. After all, these are trees in the same genus and they don’t appear to be very different, but these species normally grow more than 5,000 km apart. The continents they are native to are supposed to have separated something more than 50 million years ago. So, these are species that should have been on their own different paths of evolution for tens of million years. That is the kind of timespan that Darwinists typically invoke to explain the evolution of humans, chimpanzees, old world and new world monkeys from some kind of primitive monkey.\\nThe idea that two organisms could be separated by thousands of kilometers and tens of millions of years, yet still be capable of interbreeding, seems incredible, and it seems even more incredible from a Darwinian perspective than from a Biblical perspective. There are alternative and more reasonable explanations. The most obvious is that these two species are not separated by tens of millions of years. This may be because life isn’t millions of years old, or it may be that what became the American sycamore was transported in the relatively recent past from the Middle East to what is now the United States. Or maybe the American Sycamore was transported to the Middle East. In either case, there is no 50 million years.\\nExplanations to maintain the idea of millions of years get progressively more heroic as more and more unexpected hybridizations are discovered, and these are not difficult to find. For example, male jaguars from the New World will mate with female lions from the Old World to produce heathy jaglions.\\nEvidence 4-Interchangeable parts[4]\\nThe cells of all organisms are teeming with a wide variety of nanomachines performing all the functions necessary to keep cells alive. Do these molecular machines, which operate with incredible speed and efficiency, look as if they evolved in different kind of organisms over hundreds of millions or billions of years?\\nImagine driving a Ford Focus with a damaged headlamp assembly. It would be surprising to find out that the headlamp could be replaced with one from the previous Focus model and preposterous to believe it could be replaced with the headlamp from a Model-T Ford. Yet, interchangeably like this is exactly what we see in cells.\\nA good example is a molecular machine called Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), which plays a vital role in production of the proteins found in membranes. SRP is made up of a stretch of RNA—a molecule similar to DNA—and several proteins. It turns out that the protein and RNA components of SRP are interchangeable between an extraordinary range of organisms. Human SRP proteins form functional SRPs when combined with the RNA component of Xenopus laevis (frogs) or Drosophila (flies). Replacing one major component of Canis familiaris (dog) SRPs with the single large SRP protein from a bacterium called Escherichia coli, makes a SRP functional in all respects except for binding to the endoplasmic reticulum receptor. The corresponding dog SRP protein can bind to the RNA portion of E. coli SRP.\\nData like these are well explained by a model in which a designer uses standard parts to make different machines and these machines have not drifted apart over time. The idea that modern dogs and bacteria separated from a common ancestor a billion or more years ago and went through the extraordinary changes necessary to produce the organisms we observe today, yet retain interchangeable molecular parts seems incredible. By comparison, recent creation of life seems quite reasonable. Both require miracles, but maintaining interchangeable parts over a billion years seems a very long and complex miracle compared to a recent creation.\\nEvidence 5-Carbon-14[5]\\nRadiometric dating is commonly seen as one of the strongest argument that life is millions or billions of years old. In this technique, the concentrations of unstable atomic isotopes and their daughter products produced upon breaking down should indicate the age of a sample. Because these isotopes are thought to break down at a constant rate, a sample with very little of the unstable isotope and an abundance of the daughter products should be old.\\nWhen measuring the age of biological things, the most obvious isotope to use is Carbon-14. This is very similar to the regular carbon we find in diamonds, graphite and the chemicals that make up living things, the only difference being that it has two extra neutrons in its nucleus.\\nCarbon-14 breaks down fairly slowly so that half of the Carbon-14 in a sample will be gone after about 5,700 years. After another 5,700 years, half of the remaining Carbon-14 will be gone and so on for every passing 5,700 years. After about 20 5,700 year increments (114,000 years) only one millionth of the original Carbon-14 will be left in the sample. As there is very little Carbon-14 in the first place, by the time a sample is over 100,000 years old, there should—at least theoretically—be too little Carbon-14 to measure.\\nThis is where things get interesting. It turns out that Carbon-14 has been measured in coal and other biological samples that are supposed to be tens to hundreds of millions of years old. Most reasonably, these data mean that the plants used to form the coal lived within the past 100,000 years.\\nExample of a coal bed, from the Bulli Coal Measures, New South Wales, Australia.What does a Darwinist who believes life is millions or billions of years old to do with these data? Generally, the response is that the Carbon-14 detected is a consequence of contamination, or that it was somehow generated within the samples. There are responses that could be made to these responses, but they get progressively more technical. If nothing else, this situation illustrates that it is common for people to reject radiometric dates, like Carbon-14 dates, when they do not agree with their prior ideas about the way things must be.\\nConclusions\\nThis is not supposed to be an exhaustive list of all the possible scientific evidence consistent with life’s recent creation. No doubt, there are many other evidences which could be added, but I find these data to be informative.\\nWhen we evaluate scientific theories, it is essential to remember that empirical data are the final word. Time prevents empirical observation of life’s origin, which means we can only interpret the current data. It is important to keep in mind that the further interpretation is from data, the greater the number of necessary assumptions, the greater the number of logical steps, the less certain the conclusion.\\nIn my experience, evidence interpreted within a biblical framework requires an equal number, or fewer, assumptions and logical steps than interpretations requiring long expanses of Darwinian time. Everyone who wishes to know what is true will have to figure this out to some degree for themselves. In doing this, independent thinking is invaluable. Of course you will think that you are right most of the time, but one should never be so sure of that that they are unwilling to consider the most informative data carefully and, perhaps, change their mind. I know that I have had to do that multiple times and I think I was right to do so. Living life as a Christian scientist doesn’t mean starting out with all the right answers, it means a humble quest for knowledge in a world that is beautiful, full of wonder, constantly surprising and brimming with mysteries. We may not have all the answers all the time, but it is reassuring to see how often reasonable interpretation of the data we observe is consistent with the record of history in God’s Word.\\nEndnotes\\n; Hofreiter M, Collins M, and Stewart JR.

But how long does it take for the organic molecules we are made of to break down after death? In general, the longer the time from death, the larger the amount of decay that should be observed. This is particularly true for soft tissue, the parts of an organism that are not mineralized (such as skin, muscles, or blood vessels). In 1993, Mary Schweitzer, then affiliated with the Museum of the Rockies, shared data suggesting the possibility of soft tissue and biomolecules preservation in a bone of Tyrannosaurus rex supposedly 68 Ma old [1]. Her findings were met with great resistance and skepticism. Similar observations of blood vessels, collagen, and osteocytes from dinosaur bone had been published by Roman Pawlicki and his colleagues since 1966 [2], but had not stirred much debate, probably because Jurassic Park, which popularized the subject, had not been written and filmed yet.In the last two decades, Mary Schweitzer and her group found additional examples and used a widening array of analytical techniques to document their findings [3-9]. Consequently, the possibility of preservation of original dinosaur soft tissue and biomolecules is becoming more accepted, and this blog post reviews some of what has been published on the subject in the last year and a half.Dinosaur specimens with soft tissue preservation reported in 2016-2017 Three different dinosaur skeletons, with bones in articulation or association, were described in the literature with special mention of or an emphasis on the presence of soft tissue.The first, a ceratopsian ornithischian (Psittacosaurus sp.) from the Lower Cretaceous of China (Fig. 1), has skin preserved as a compressed film with characteristic pigmentation patterns [10]. The pigments are thought to represent original organic matter, more specifically melanin residues. This interpretation was based on SEM microscopy, showing ovoid impressions similar to melanosomes (melanin-bearing organelles).Fig. 1: The specimen of Psittacosaurus sp. (A) and interpretative drawing showing different skeletal elements and skin with pigment patterns (B). Image from Vinther et al. (2016), (CC BY).The second, an ankylosaurine dinosaur (Zuul crurivastator) from the Upper Cretaceous of Montana, preserves integumentary structures such as osteoderms, with dark sheaths probably consisting of original keratin [11]. The paper describing the fossil does not present a chemical or microscopic analysis of the soft tissue, but mentions it as the subject for further future investigation.The third dinosaur skeleton is also of an ankylosaur (Borealopelta markmitchelli), from the Lower Cretaceous of Alberta [12]. This articulated skeleton was found in marine deposits, in a formation where ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs had been recovered but never a dinosaur. The encasing sediments show evidence of rapid burial of the carcass, with absence of scavenging in spite of some burrows in the surrounding deposits. The exceptional preservation of the fossil encompasses the molecular level, with remnants of organic matter in scales and horn sheaths of the body armor. Chemical analysis through mass spectroscopy indicated the presence of melanin in the organic residue, especially pheomelanin (a reddish-brown pigment). Melanosomes do not appear to have been preserved in this specimen.Perhaps less impressive than soft tissue preservation, but equally interesting, is the evidence for preservation in dinosaur bone tissue of original molecular components that have a distinct chemical composition. This chemical signature was used to substantiate the presence of medullary bone (a type of bone produced by mature female birds during ovulation) in T. rex remains from the Upper Cretaceous of Montana [13].Mark Armitage provided new documentation [14] of the exquisite preservation of blood vessels, osteocytes, and collagen at the submicron level in the Triceratops horridus horn and rib bones he discovered in Upper Cretaceous deposits of Montana [15]. The observations are based on microscopy and mostly from dissolved bone material. The next step in this project should be chemical analysis of the material. This example of soft tissue preservation is particularly stunning, given the relatively strong weathering of the horn (roots, fungal hyphae, and insect remains were found traversing the horn).Mary Schweitzer and colleagues published a new study [16] on the remains of the hadrosaur Brachylophosaurus canadensis (Upper Cretaceous of Montana) that had previously yielded evidence for preservation of endogenous biomolecules [6]. Using a more rigorous protocol for sample preparation and higher resolution mass spectrometry techniques, they recovered 8 peptide sequences of collagen from the hadrosaur bone. Two of the sequences identified replicated some found in the previous study, whereas the other six were new.Fig. 2: Vascular canal from rib bone of Lufengosaurus showing protein infilling material (transparent), partly outside of the cut canal (red arrow), and microcrystals of hematite (dark) within the canal. Image from Lee et al. (2017), (CC BY 4.0).An important study presented results obtained on a sauropodomorph dinosaur (Lufengosaurus) from the Lower Jurassic of China [17]. Flat, transparent fragments of soft tissue located along and inside vascular canals in a rib bone (Fig. 2) were analyzed with infrared spectroscopy directly applied in situ and not on processed samples of bone. This non-destructive technique prevents the possibility of sample contamination during dissolution. The absorption spectrum observed was distinctive and typical of collagen. Moreover, particles of hematite (an iron oxide) were found in the vascular canals (Fig. 2) and lacunae left by osteocytes. The particles were interpreted as forming from iron ions attached to blood cells and iron-binding proteins. In the words of the authors, this study provided “undeniable, clear evidence that collagen and protein remains were preserved inside the osteonal central vascular canals of this early dinosaur.”Finally, an intriguing abstract was presented at the 2017 meeting of the Canadian Society of Vertebrate Paleontology [18]. Fossils from the Upper Cretaceous Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta showed an unexpectedly high rate of soft tissue preservation. A collection of bone samples from 25 specimens (16 of which dinosaurs), representing different degree of articulation and preserved either in sandstone or in mudstone, were dissolved and searched for soft tissue preservation. Of the 22 samples that successfully dissolved, 20 (including the dinosaur specimens) tested positive for soft tissues. It appears that soft tissue preservation in the Dinosaur Park Formation might be more common than expected, irrespective of the type of embedding sediment or degree of articulation of a specimen.Recent papers discussing the preservation process Understanding the pathway through which organic molecules can be preserved for tens to hundreds of millions of years is a significant challenge for those who subscribe to a “deep time” chronology. Proteins, for example, are thought to significantly degrade in shorter time frames of a few tens of thousands of years [19]. Therefore, several studies are attempting to explore potential mechanisms that could result in exceptional preservation of soft tissue in dinosaur remains.Some have suggested that perhaps the blood vessels and osteocyte-like structures in dinosaur bones do not represent original organic material but are mimics created by bacterial biofilms colonizing the cavities of the bone [20]. However, Schweitzer et al. [21] presented data from actualistic experiments with bacterial biofilms to discard this hypothesis as inadequate. Interestingly, in the preparation of bone samples for their experiments they observed that removal of organics from bone is not easy, even with harsh treatment including repeated cycles of extreme heat, bleach, and enzyme treatment. Their suggestion is that when encased in dense cortical bone, labile organics can persist longer.In their paper on preserved collagen from a Lufengosaurus bone, Lee et al. found that collagen was preserved only in the vascular canals, not in the bone matrix [17]. Given that the interior of the vascular canals often contained hematite particles, the authors suggested the collagen was preserved because it remained trapped between hematite concretions inside the vessels and the surrounding carbonated apatite minerals in the bone matrix.Finally, some are still questioning the reliability of the results published by Mary Schweitzer and her group. For example, Buckley et al. [22] demonstrated that all the published putative dinosaur peptide sequences from T. rex and B. canadensis are matched by sequences of collagen from ostrich bone. Their suggested implication is that cross-contamination of the dinosaur samples with ostrich material in the lab cannot be ruled out.Conclusive considerationsThe discussion surrounding the preservation of dinosaur soft tissue is a fascinating example of a paradigm shift in science. Although still met with certain resistance, the evidence for endogenous biomolecular material in fossils has led to a proliferation of new observations and an openness to search for data that were previously overlooked, just because they were considered beyond the realm of possibility. It is clear that this field has a great potential for growth, including a better systematization of the type of molecules that are more commonly preserved in the fossil record and of possible differential levels of degradation and decay observed in these biomolecules at different stratigraphic levels.This area of research is very relevant for origins model, because it has implications for the discussion on a long vs short chronology of life on the earth. Is it realistic to think that these original tissues were indeed preserved for tens of millions of years? Are they rather evidence for a much shorter time elapsed since the death of a fossilized organism, in the order of thousands of years? My impression is that the answer to these questions will not depend much on the evidence itself. When it comes to origins and historical sciences, “silver bullets” or unassailable proof of a model tend to be elusive. Those committed to a long chronology will probably attempt to normalize something that was formerly considered exceptional, presenting numerous scenarios of how preservation through “deep time” could be possible. Perhaps, a positive outcome of these efforts will be a better understanding of biomolecular structure, thermodynamics, decay pathways, and interaction with the surrounding chemical environment. However, those who subscribe to a biblical chronology will also have the opportunity to point out possible inadequacies of postulated mechanisms of preservation through “deep time.” Moreover, if soft tissue preservation turns out to be more common than previously thought, instead of “exceptional,” this line of evidence would also fit well with a short chronology and flood model of origins, not necessarily “proving” but being certainly compatible with a biblical worldview. Indeed, the most exquisite and pristine examples of original soft tissue preservation will likely remain a challenging puzzle for those who assign them ages covering periods of time so immense to be even hard to conceptualize.References[1] Schweitzer, M.H., Biomolecule preservation in Tyrannosaurus rex.

Hayes', 'doc': '\\n                \\nissue of Chemical & Engineering News featured this recent research as it interests chemists and engineers who are trying to find innovative ways to preserve unstable carbon-based molecules of life: “Although commonly found in moss and lichens, tardigrades are truly aquatic animals, requiring a film of water surrounding their body to take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. Without water, they dry out, practically cease metabolism, and curl up into a sturdy desiccated form called a tun. It is the tun state that enables tardigrades to withstand many extremes. And then if they return to water, they bounce right back.”   It is believed that tardigrades produce various “dry-tolerant proteins” that “are intrinsically disordered in water but develop secondary structures in the dehydrated state that allow them to stabilize DNA, proteins, and cell membranes.”Carbon-based chemistry in living systems is  constantly under thermodynamic and kinetic distress from heat, light, radiation, oxygen, water and other reactive chemicals that limits their longevity. This is to say nothing of the enzymatic biological attacks from the microbial world that slice-and-dice organic chemicals in an effort recycle them for their own energetic requirements.   The same flexibility that allows living systems to constantly recycle and renew carbon-based materials are the same mechanisms that inhibit long term stability.Ryan T. Hayes is a Ph.D. chemist (Andrews University) studying how to preserve vitamin C and other biomolecules through the use of spherical nanopolymers called dendrimers.\\n                \\n                \\n                \\n                \\n            ', 'date': '2016-11-29', 'url': 'https://www.grisda.org/stability-of-organic-molecules-lessons-from-vitamin-c-1'}, {'title': 'The Paleozoic Rock Record: A Broad Overview of Features and Trends\\n', 'author': 'Ronny Nalin', 'doc': '\\n                \\nThe rocks of the Earth are like pages of a history book containing information about the past. Geologists who enjoy reading this “book” have found that it consists of two “volumes:” the first, named Precambrian, is mostly devoid of macroscopic fossils. The second, named Phanerozoic, contains layers and sediments providing a rich archive of past forms of animal and vegetal life. The Phanerozoic “volume” is further subdivided in three “sections,” called Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic, each consisting of several “chapters” (Fig. 1) [1].\\nFig. 1: The geologic column, with its standard subdivisions, including the Paleozoic and its systems.\\nThis article focuses on the Paleozoic interval of the geologic record. Estimates from global compilations of maps suggest that about 20% of the surface of the Earth is covered by Paleozoic rocks [2]. These rocks are usually well preserved, although mineralogical modifications (e.g., recrystallization) and physical disruption (e.g., faulting and folding) are common. Therefore, Paleozoic rocks represent a substantial and accessible part of the rock record and attempting a comprehensive synthesis of their main characteristics in a blog post is an impossible task. This overview concentrates on selected topics about Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks, fossil patterns, and tectonics. The article will close with some suggestions on the significance form a creationist perspective of salient features and trends in Paleozoic rocks.\\nPaleozoic Sedimentary Rocks\\n1) Global Stratigraphic Signal. There is a great variety of types represented in Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. However, when looking at the macroscale, certain types of rocks show a specific frequency increase within the Paleozoic or some of its intervals. This non-random pattern of stratigraphic distribution [3] is often observed on a global scale. Examples include: Cambrian sandstone composed almost exclusively of quartz (Fig. 2), found across most of the North American continent and documented on other continents [4]; peaks in abundance of carbonate deposits in the lower and mid-Paleozoic [4, 5], including (for the lower Paleozoic) globally distributed facies such as stromatolites [6] and flat-pebble conglomerates (Fig. 3) [7]; widespread marine black shales, rich in organic carbon, common in the lower Paleozoic and upper Devonian-Mississippian [8]; abundant reef-like deposits in the Silurian and especially in the Devonian [9, 10]; immense coal deposits in the Pennsylvanian and Permian [11]; and extremely wide and thick accumulations of evaporites in the Permian [12].\\nFig. 2: An example of Cambrian quartzite, consisting of well rounded and well sorted quartz granules.

Penny for scale is 2 cm wide.\\nFig. 3: An example of Cambrian flat pebble conglomerate, consisting of variously orientated elongated limestone pebbles, several cm in size. Notch Peak Formation, Millard County, Utah, USA. Scale increments are 1cm wide.\\n2) Widespread Marine Deposition over the Continents. Lower to mid-Paleozoic sedimentary rocks are remarkable in documenting large-scale flooding and establishment of seas over continental interiors. This is perhaps best seen in the North American rock record, where up to four major successive continent-wide flooding phases can be observed in Paleozoic deposits [13]. The topography of the submerged continents must have been very subdued because the layers deposited over the flooded landscape generally show extremely high lateral continuity and flat basal contacts (Fig. 4). In some cases, even thin beds only a few cm thick can be followed laterally for tens of kilometers [14].\\nFig. 4: A classic example of flat contacts between laterally widespread Paleozoic layers. Grand Canyon, Arizona, USA.\\n3) Upward Increase in Terrestrial Deposits. If it is true that the lower to mid-Paleozoic is dominated by marine deposits even over continental landmasses, terrestrial deposits become substantially more represented in the upper Paleozoic, from the Pennsylvanian upward [15]. In addition, the style of fluvial deposition also appears to differ, with predominantly sheet-like sandy deposits in the lower Paleozoic being complemented from the mid-Paleozoic upward by mud-rich deposits, interpreted as more typical of meandering rivers [16].\\n4) From Low to High Frequency Cyclicity\\nWhen tracing rock units along the vertical direction, it is common to see repetitions of certain types of deposits (e.g., sandstone, mudstone, limestone). The cyclical pattern in these rock types reflects changes in the environments of deposition, such as variations in water depth and sediment supply. These changes in rock types, often marked by discontinuity surfaces between packages of layers, are observed throughout Paleozoic sedimentary deposits. However, in the upper Paleozoic (starting from the upper Mississippian) a marked increase in the frequency of these sedimentary cycles is observed on a global scale [17]. Broadly speaking, lower to mid-Paleozoic relatively monotonous deposits are overlain by cyclical successions more intensely punctuated by discontinuities and alternations of different rock types.\\nPaleozoic Igneous Rocks\\n1) Volcanic Rocks. It is difficult to systematically address global trends in volumes and types of volcanism during the Paleozoic, because of limitations due to the incomplete nature of the rock record. Notably, while basaltic rocks of the ocean floor offer a continuous record of submarine volcanism for the Cenozoic and part of the Mesozoic, only slivers of Paleozoic oceanic crust are preserved. However, Paleozoic rocks do contain a record of some notable episodes of volcanic activity. For example, Upper Ordovician deposits from North America and Europe contain a cluster of ash layers attributed to some of the largest explosive volcanic eruptions ever recorded in the whole Phanerozoic [18, 19]. Large igneous provinces (LIPs), which are regions preserving immense volumes of lava effused within a very narrow stratigraphic interval, have also been documented for the Paleozoic. They include Cambrian, Devonian, and Permian examples, the most spectacular being the Siberian Traps in Russia, where an estimated volume of over 2 million km3 of magma were mobilized at the very end of the Paleozoic [20].\\n2) Plutonic Rocks. Plutonic rocks form from the solidification of magma at depth in the Earth’s crust and constitute the core of the continents. The study of plutonic rocks, therefore, helps to understand the timing and process of formation of the continents. For example, it would be interesting to know how much of the continental crust formed or was recycled during the Paleozoic. Limitations in dating and the incompleteness of the rock record hamper these types of reconstructions. However, some clues can be obtained in indirect ways. Zircon, for example, is a mineral that forms during the crystallization of magma and is very durable and resistant. Even if the original intrusive rock hosting a zircon is eroded, the detrital zircon may survive and be included in younger rocks. Studies looking at the age distribution of detrital zircons indicate that the Paleozoic was one of several intervals with significant crystallization or recycling of crust [21]. Another way to assess the Paleozoic production of plutonic rocks is to look at their preserved surface area compiled from geologic maps. It appears that Paleozoic plutonic rocks are more abundant on the Earth’s surface than their Precambrian or Cenozoic counterparts [22]. This confirms that the Paleozoic was an interval of significant magma emplacement and crystallization.\\nPaleozoic Fossil Patterns\\n1) Diversity Trends. The most remarkable aspect of the Paleozoic rock record is the abundance of macroscopic animal fossils when compared with underlying Precambrian rocks. This major transition has been called the “Cambrian explosion” and occurs in lower Cambrian strata, where fossils of most animal phyla first appear [23]. An equally important interval is what has been called the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE), referring to a remarkable increase in diversity of marine fossil groups in the Lower to Mid-Ordovician [24]. The Cambrian explosion is unique for the sudden appearance of a large number of new animal body plans, but the GOBE shows the greatest increase in diversity of fossil forms within already known body plans. As a result of these two important stratigraphic intervals, Paleozoic marine faunas can be broadly divided in two groups [25]: the Cambrian fauna (dominated by trilobites) and the overlying Paleozoic fauna (dominated by suspension feeders such as brachiopods, bryozoans, crinoids, and corals) (Fig. 5). These faunas are punctuated by several turnovers at specific stratigraphic levels (e.g., top of Ordovician and, most significantly, top of Permian), where the coordinated disappearance of certain groups is observed [26].\\nFig. 5: Close up view of a typical example of a lower Paleozoic marine fossil assemblage after the GOBE. Brachiopods, bryozoans, and crinoids make up most of the skeletal fragments seen in the picture. Upper Ordovician Richmond Group, Hueston Woods State Park, Ohio, USA. Scale increments are in cm.\\n2) Ecological Trends. Along with increased diversity, the GOBE seems to mark a shift to marine faunal assemblages representative of greater ecological complexity [24]. Cambrian layers contain mostly invertebrates that lived on the surface of bottom sediments, but overlying strata include planktonic organisms, fish, burrowers, and suspension feeders that stood taller above the bottom because they were erect. Another important transition is observed in mid-Paleozoic strata, where the fossil record ceases to include only marine organisms and begins to document terrestrial organisms. Macroscopic fossils of land plants first appear in the Silurian and become more common in the Devonian [27], terrestrial invertebrates (including insects, spiders, and millipedes) first appear in the Devonian [28], and a few tracks and remains of land vertebrates first appear in the Devonian [29] but become common in the Carboniferous. Notable groups completely absent from Paleozoic layers are dinosaurs, mammals, birds, and flowering plants.\\nPaleozoic Plate Tectonics\\nReconstructions based on paleomagnetism and distribution of major orogenic belts seem to indicate that the initial Paleozoic configuration of continents consisted of four distinct major continental masses, one of which (named Gondwana) grouped all the current continents of the southern hemisphere [30]. Interestingly, whereas most of the margins of these continents show lowermost Paleozoic patterns of sedimentation typical of passive, extensional margins, a remarkable tectonic shift is observed in the Upper Cambrian to Ordovician, where most of these continental margins show evidence for the onset of large scale active convergence [31]. An intriguing aspect of Ordovician plate tectonics is that none of the widespread convergent margins seem to involve collision between continents but only accretion of microcontinents and volcanic arcs, a condition not seen in any other part of the Phanerozoic [32]. A sustained trend of convergence is consistently documented by orogenic belts along continental margins throughout the Paleozoic, resulting in the progressive amalgamation of the different continental masses. Paleogeographic reconstructions indicate that the continents were finally assembled into a supercontinent (named Pangea) by the Early Permian, a configuration that persisted to the end of the Paleozoic [33].\\nAnother feature of interest for Paleozoic plate tectonics is the suggestion of a Cambrian episode of significant true polar wander [34, 35]. This phenomenon implies the redistribution of continental masses with respect to Earth’s axis of rotation resulting in movements of tens of degrees of latitude (e.g., from polar to tropical latitudes) and representing a mechanism of plate motions faster than and different from classic plate tectonics.\\nThe Paleozoic: A Creationist Perspective\\nThe existence of a discontinuity in terms of fossil content between the Precambrian and the Paleozoic makes it tempting for creationists to link this horizon to a major discontinuity in Earth’s history. This perception is reinforced when considering that the base of the Paleozoic is often expressed with a physical stratigraphic discontinuity [4] that marks a mechanical-erosional boundary and a significant shift in sedimentary and tectonic conditions [36].\\nFrom a biblically informed perspective, a possible candidate to generate such discontinuity would be the global flood of Genesis 6-8. Some Paleozoic sedimentary patterns would fit well on a general level with the description of the biblical catastrophe, in particular the patterns of extensive flooding of continental masses and global signature in the style of sedimentation. Extensive plate rearrangements could also be hypothesized as part of the flood event, and the lowermost Paleozoic presents an interesting interval where both fast plate reorganization and change in predominant tectonic regime seem to be documented. Certainly, plate tectonics offer an important background mechanism to explain several Paleozoic trends. For example, the progressive assembly of Pangea might have controlled the Paleozoic trend in increasing terrestrialization observed both in the sedimentary and fossil record. Interestingly, this parallel increase in preservation of continental deposits and land fossils supports the suggestion of creationists that trends in appearance of fossil groups result at least in part from sampling of different habitats and ecosystems rather than biological evolution. The trend toward a supercontinent configuration might also have played a role in the switch to higher frequency cyclicity observed in the upper Paleozoic sedimentary record, as clastic material from exposed landmasses with extensive drainage systems became more available. Finally, active plate convergence during the Paleozoic would account for the modal peak in Paleozoic igneous rocks, as continental collision settings tend to be favorable for the preservation of new continental crust [37].\\nIn the modern history of creationism, the general consensus about where to place Paleozoic rocks in biblical history has followed an interesting trajectory. The majority of Scriptural geologists, in the first half of the 19th century, assigned the formation of Paleozoic rocks to the time between Day 3 of creation and the onset of the flood [38]. The trend was decidedly reversed in the 20th century, when key figures such as G. Price, H. Clark, H. Morris, and J. Whitcomb clearly interpreted the formation of Paleozoic fossil-bearing rocks as a consequence of the flood [39]. In the past two decades, there has been renewed consideration among some creationists of the possibility that part of the Paleozoic might have been deposited before the flood [40, 41].\\nGiven the immensity of data archived in the Paleozoic rock record, any attempt at a synthetic model from a creationist perspective will have to find the delicate balance between an ability to see the bigger picture without overlooking important details. Before that balance is reached, an exciting work of study and discovery will continue to accompany us in our journey.\\nRonny Nalin, PhD\\nGeoscience Research Institute\\nEndontes\\n\\n\\tThis article adopts the standard geologic column as a reliable indicator of the spatial stratigraphic order of rocks, without endorsing the absolute chronology attached to it.

Clausen', 'doc': '\\n                \\nBecause the Precambrian part of geologic history covers so much material, the discussion is split into three parts with this being the third. Here is a summary of the three sections:\\nThe first section summarizes the standard model for formation of the Universe, Solar System and Earth, Moon, oceans, continents, and plate tectonics.\\nThe second section describes Precambrian rock exposures, as well as the atmosphere, climate, and Precambrian life. Many illustrative pictures are included.\\nThis third section provides two perspectives suggested by creationists.\\nA CREATIONIST PERSPECTIVECreationists have two major ways (Roth, 1998) of explaining the Precambrian record: (1) it was mainly formed during the first half of creation week; or (2) the inorganic Earth is actually billions of years old, but then God created life on Earth a few thousand years ago.First scenario. Those who believe that the entire creation is young note that: it may be inconsistent to explain the earth, light, water, air, land, sun, moon, and stars as created by process over long periods, but explain the birds, fish, animals, and humans as created by fiat in a week; the heavens and starry host were created fiat (Ps 33:6-9) and apparently as part of the six days (Gen 2:1; see also Doukhan, 2004, p.29-32); if the creation is partly old and partly young, then God had one Decalogue (see, Ex 20:8-11) for millions of years and then changed it a few thousand years ago. Personally, this scenario seems to be the most consistent reading of the inspired record.In this scenario, Andrew Snelling (2009, p.467-470, 613-621) has suggested that the first few days of creation week involved unique inorganic processes not happening today: they exhibited a departure from the laws of thermodynamics, for matter was formed ex nihilo and useful energy increased. Robert Gentry (Gentry, 1988) has used pleochroic haloes as an evidence for the rapid formation of granitic rocks on the third day of creation. Michael Oard (1997) has suggested that any evidence for Precambrian glaciation can be explained in other ways. One summary discussion of this all-young creation can be found at Creation Ministries International.Snelling (2009, p.321-327) fully recognizes that the Precambrian is a major part of the geologic record. He then emphasizes (p.205-209, 623-627) that during the first day of creation week the Universe, the Earth, light, and the night-day cycle were created. Snelling (p.211-212, 627-629) suggests that the second day of creation week saw the creation of the atmosphere from volcanic gases, interstellar space to hold the sun, moon, and stars, and Earth’s earliest crust from hot magma and hydrothermal fluids from the mantle. The third day (p.213-214, 631-638) brought the creation of the dry land and seas by horizontal and vertical catastrophic plate tectonics at supernatural rates, as well as creation of soils and plants and of cyanobacteria that form stromatolite structures. During the fourth day (p.219-224, 639-641) major tectonic activity could have continued, but primarily God created the sun, moon, and stars to take over the light-giving function.Second scenario. Those who accept that part of creation may be old and part young note that: angels may have existed before the creation of this world (Job 38:7; Eze 28:12-15); Genesis 1 may not indicate when the angels, stars, sun, moon and Earth (Andreasen 1981) were created; heaven and earth may only refer to the firmament (v.8) and dry land (v.10).This “old earth / young life” idea (Widmer, 1992; Johnsson, 1993) has not been developed scientifically, but has been briefly outlined by Gorman Gray (2000). This scenario would probably accept much of the standard scientific model outlined above for the inorganic material of the earth. It would probably include long ages of plate tectonic activity with the accompanying earthquakes and volcanoes, and long ages of radioactive decay that are found in Precambrian rocks and could be inherited into more recent rocks by recycling. It would probably only reject the origin of complex life before a recent creation week.Complex life. In neither of these scenarios would one expect to find evidence of complex life in the Precambrian. Therefore, creationists would dispute the evidence for life in the Precambrian, or attribute the evidence to non-organic processes, or explain it as the result of later organisms invading deep Precambrian rocks (Roth, 1992). However, some creationists might accept the evidence pointing to pre-creation life, since single-celled organisms are not mentioned in the Genesis creation record.Evolutionists as well would not expect to find complex life in the Precambrian. When asked what evidence might destroy his confidence in the theory of evolution, J. B. S. Haldane reportedly responded with \"Precambrian rabbits\" as one example. Although not rabbits, at one point it was suggested that angiosperm pollen had been found in the Precambrian, but with further analysis the evidence appeared to be the result of sample contamination (Chadwick, 1981).The strongest creationist evidence against the standard scientific scenario is based on the difficulty of explaining the origin of life from non-life (Javor, 1998; Horgan, 2011). In addition, the sudden appearance of a great variety of complex life forms in Cambrian rocks, right above the Precambrian, seems difficult to explain in the standard evolutionary paradigm. The Cambrian explosion argument presented by creationists is outlined by The Discovery Institute, The Centre for Intelligent Design, Answers in Genesis, and Creation-Evolution Headlines. The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry presents a counter-response.Summary. No matter what scenario is accepted, creationists attribute Earth’s geology data to God working either through natural processes or by direct intervention.REFERENCES\\nNiels-Erik Andreasen (1981). “The Word ‘Earth’ in Genesis 1:1.” Origins, v.8, p.13-19.\\nArthur V.

This does not have an easy answer, but the Geoscience Research Institute will be addressing the question in several articles outlining the different parts of the geologic column. The standard divisions are: Precambrian with little life, Paleozoic with old life, Mesozoic with intermediate life, and Cenozoic with recent life. This series begins with the Precambrian and is based partly on Biblical Research Institute Science Council presentations and a field trip that occurred in 1993 at Glacier View Ranch south of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.\\nIn the standard chronology of Earth’s geologic history, the Precambrian part covers by far the largest fraction of time – 88% of the total. This spans the time from 4.56 Ga to about 0.54 Ga, where “Ga” stand for giga annum or billions of years ago. The standard scientific timeframe is included because many conservative Seventh-day Adventist academics are comfortable with long ages for inorganic matter and believe that only life was created recently.\\nBecause this article attempts to cover so much material, the discussion is split into three parts. The first two parts present the standard scientific model, where in some cases various models are being suggested for one set of data. Design examples and creationist ideas are interspersed throughout these first two sections. The third part presents some additional creationist perspectives, although not much science is available. (To date young-age creationists have spent little time trying to explain the Precambrian in terms of a recent creation, with little speculation and less scientific research.) Here are the three sections:\\n\\n\\tThis first section summarizes the standard model for formation of the Universe, Solar System and Earth, Moon, oceans, continents, and plate tectonics. Brief references to the Universe, Sun, and Moon are included because what happens beyond Earth sets the stage for what happens on Earth during the Precambrian and in the Genesis 1 account.\\n\\tThe second section describes Precambrian rock exposures, as well as the atmosphere, climate, and Precambrian life. Many illustrative pictures are included.\\n\\tThe third section provides two perspectives suggested by creationists: (1) a young universe and life and (2) old inorganic material, but young life.\\nSome of the terms and concepts addressed here are too complex to do them justice in a single article. For this reason, many web links and references are included to provide more detail and a more complete understanding. The outline of the standard model is based especially on The Story of Earth by Hazen (2012). Additional information is available from a scholarly volume on Earth’s Oldest Rocks edited by Van Kranendonk et al. (2007). The web provides additional resources such as Encyclopedia Britannica, Michigan State University, Live Science, an historical geology textbook website, a journal devoted to Precambrian Research, a YouTube video, a good summary timescale, and a few cartoons.\\nUNIVERSE\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\tThe NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope observes some of the most beautiful galaxies in our skies —  This little spiral, known as NGC 4102, has a different kind of appeal, with its tightly-wound spiral arms and understated, but charming, appearance. NGC 4102 lies in the northern constellation of Ursa Major (The Great Bear).\\n\\t\\n).\\nThe Big Bang created quarks, which coalesced into protons and neutrons that then formed atoms such as hydrogen and an environment where light could travel through space. These hydrogen atoms clustered into stars which became hot under gravitational pressure and started burning by nuclear fusion, just as in a hydrogen bomb. The “burning” meant combining four protons or hydrogen nuclei (1H) together into helium (4He).\\nAfter the hydrogen had been converted to helium, the helium started combining so that three helium nuclei would combine to form carbon (12C), but carbon must have a certain excited-state resonance energy for this to work. Before this resonance energy was experimentally observed, it was predicted by Fred Hoyle as a necessary fact for nature to produce carbon by stellar evolution. Now that this resonance energy has been discovered, it has been suggested as an evidence for the intelligent design of the carbon nucleus, but the argument must be used with caution.\\nAfter 12C is produced, heavier elements were formed by the addition of more 4He nuclei to make such elements as oxygen (16O), magnesium (24Mg), silicon (32S), and iron (56Fe). Atoms heavier than iron require an input of energy, so did not form until the extra energy from a supernova explosion was available to produce atoms of iodine, platinum, gold, mercury, lead, uranium, etc. These stellar explosions seeded space with these elements, many of which are just exactly the elements necessary for life.\\nSOLAR SYSTEM AND EARTH\\nRemnants of these stellar explosions formed clouds of gas and dust. One such nebular cloud with its mass all rotating in the same direction developed into our Solar System with a large central bulge forming the Sun and the remainder coalescing into planets.\\nThis Sun is the ideal size for life on earth: if it were ten times larger it would burn too fast, and if it were ten times smaller it would not provide enough energy. During Earth’s early stages, the Sun had only about 70% of its current light output. This might suggest a much colder early Earth, but evidence for liquid water at that time indicates that that was not the case. This warmer-than-expected Earth has been explained by a greenhouse effect and by the Earth absorbing a much higher percentage of the Sun’s energy in the past.\\n) summarizes a book on the accretion and differentiation of the early Earth.\\nAbout 10% of meteorites are iron that once formed the cores of planetesimals and 90% are silica rich chondrites that once formed their mantles. Present day examples of these early meteorites are most easily found in the Earth’s Antarctic ice fields and the Sahara desert. The largest known iron-nickel meteorite is the Hoba meteorite displayed near Grootfontein in Namibia.\\nMOON\\nIn the standard scientific model, the Moon formed within fifty million years after the development of the Solar System. It was once thought that the Moon formed by the breakup of the Earth, or by being captured from a solar orbit, or by accretion just as the Earth had. New data from Moon rocks in the early 1970s however, indicated that these theories were not satisfactory. The Moon lacked an iron core and volatiles like water, so its composition was too different from that of Earth.\\n) suggests that the Moon was produced by a head-on collision.\\nInitially the Moon is thought to have orbited the Earth at a distance of about 15,000 miles. At that time the Earth would have rotated on its axis every five hours, a solar eclipse occurred every 84 hours, and the Earth had monster tides. As the Moon moved away from the Earth at about 4 cm per year, the Moon orbited the Earth faster and the Earth’s rotation slowed due to conservation of angular momentum.\\nOCEANS\\nWater is ubiquitous in our Solar System in moons and planets, underground oceans and volcanoes. The Moon has subsurface ice and its rocks are 750 parts per million water. Venus had water early in its history, but it was lost due to heat from a runaway greenhouse effect. Mars has a metal core, a silicate mantle, an atmosphere, and a subsurface global ocean hundreds of feet deep. It lost its surface water, but evidence for its past existence is found in water-rich clay, braided stream channels, river valleys, and minerals formed from the evaporation of water. Earth is between these two planets at the ideal distance from the Sun, or “Goldilocks Zone.”\\nSince the Earth is assumed to have formed from meteorites, the volatiles found in chondrites are expected to have existed in the early Earth – nitrogen, carbon dioxide, sulfur gases, and water. However, a large fraction of the expected volatiles seem to be missing, either lost to space from impacts such as Theia or deeply buried.\\nOver the last thirty years it has been suggested that Earth’s deep interior may hold prodigious amounts of water. The mantle transition zone may contain as much water as nine times the Earth’s oceans and the lower mantle as much at sixteen times as much. Under the high pressures and temperatures deep in the earth, minerals incorporate hydrogen which, along with their oxygen, can produce water. This water content is evident in granitic magmas that commonly contain 1-4% water and volcanic lavas that cause explosive volcanism as at Mt St. Helens due to the explosive release of pressurized water vapor.\\nAccording to the standard model, Earth’s early water came from the volatiles spewed out of volcanoes, so that shallow seas formed within a few tens of millions of years and oceans developed within 100 to 200 million years after Earth’s formation. The early oceans were saltier than today and apparently that salt has precipitated into salt deposits and evaporites – minerals formed from the evaporation of water.\\nWater has the unique chemical properties necessary for life (Hazen, 2012). Among other properties, it is a solvent; it has high surface tension making capillary action in vascular plants possible; and it splits into hydroxyl (OH–) and hydronium (H3O+) ions important for acid/base pH reactions. Its high heat capacity decreases Earth's temperature fluctuations to a range acceptable for life. Unlike most substances, water expands on freezing; thus ice has a lower density than water and will float. If this were not the case, ocean basins would fill with ice from the bottom up. It is a basic ingredient in biochemical reactions in our bodies that are more than half water.\\nCONTINENTS AND PLATE TECTONICS\\nOver the Earth’s history it has differentiated into a core, a mantle, and oceanic and continental crusts. The crustal plates are formed as magma rises from the mantle at spreading centers and volcanic arcs and destroyed as the tectonic plates descend back into the mantle at subduction zones. The differentiation and movement is due to gravitational effects on different density rock depending on their heat content and the arrangement of atoms in their minerals.\\nThe Earth’s rocks are made up of minerals and the minerals are composed primarily of six types of atoms: oxygen, silicon, aluminum, magnesium, calcium, and iron. One usually thinks of the oxygen in the atmosphere, but 99.99999% of it is in the Earth’s minerals. Silicon is to inorganic rocks what carbon is to organic life, since both form four bonds with surrounding atoms. These oxygen and silicon atoms together (SiO2 silica) are the primary constituents of the Earth and its silicate minerals.\\nThe early Earth was a hot magma ocean with the heat coming from the collision of meteor fragments, from gravity-induced tides, and from radioactive elements. The magma oceans cooled by conduction, convection, and radiation. The hot, early Earth differentiated based on density (in g/cm3) which is related to silica content. Higher silica content means lower density rocks, so rocks nearest the Earth’s surface are generally highest in silica. The differentiated Earth consisted of an iron core with negligible silica and a density of 10-13, a mantle with 45% silica and density of 3-4, and eventually a basalt crust with 50% silica and density 2.8-3.0. For comparison, later granitic rocks have a silica content of 60-75% and a density of 2.6-2.7. Seismology, the study of earthquake waves, is today able to identify a lower mantle made of the mineral perovskite with a density of about 4, a transition zone, and an upper mantle made of peridotite with a density of 3.1-3.4.\\nDuring the first 50 to 100 million years, a basalt crust formed from 5% partial melting of the peridotite upper mantle. Rocks don’t have a single melting temperature and the first parts to melt have a higher silica content and a lower density than the remainder. The lower density basalt was more buoyant than the mantle and rose to the surface forming black volcanic islands in the Earth’s shallow seas.\\narticle). John Baumgardner suggests that catastrophic plate tectonics began at the Genesis flood.\\nThe heat energy driving tectonic activity came from convection in the mantle, but the trigger may have been an asteroid impact. This differentiation to granite is part of the trend of elemental separation and concentration: the six major elements separated from hydrogen and helium by the solar wind; Earth’s silicate mantle separated from the iron core; basalt crust separated from mantle; water and other volatiles separated from rock; and now granite separated from basalt. The final result is low density continental crust made up of granitic rocks rich in silica, sodium, potassium, water, and trace elements. Its major minerals are quartz which eventually forms sandy beaches and feldspar which eventually breaks down to clay-rich soil.\\nThe Proterozoic from 2.5 to 0.5 Ga is marked by the onset of modern plate tectonics, including volcanoes and earthquakes. Plate tectonic activity (Condie, 1998; Rino et al., 2004; Hawkesworth et al., 2010) caused the cratons to move around and combine to form the continents and at times a single super-continent. Pangea that formed at about 0.3 Ga is the most familiar example of a super-continent, but is more recent than the Precambrian. Older examples in the Precambrian include Rodinia (1.0-0.6 Ga), Columbia/Nuna (1.9-1.4 Ga), and a more conjectural Kenorland (2.7-2.5 Ga) and Vaalbara (3.1-2.8 Ga). Of these, Andrew Snelling briefly discusses Rodinia in his plate tectonic flood model. The supercontinent cycles are the subject of ongoing study.\\nREFERENCES\\n\\n.\\n\\tKent C.

Tolkien’s, The Hobbit, Gollum gives a riddle to Bilbo:\\nThis thing all things devours:\\nBirds, beasts, trees, flowers;\\nGnaws iron, bites steel;\\nGrinds hard stones to meal;\\nSlays kings, ruins town,\\nAnd beats high mountain down.\\nIf Bilbo couldn’t give the right answer, it would lead to grave consequences, so as Gollum was getting impatient, Bilbo tried to say, “Give me more time; give me more time.” However, he was so scared that all that came out of his mouth was “… time … time” which of course was the correct answer. This riddle exemplifies how time normally results in decay and destruction.\\nSo, why are people so interested in the topic of time? Perhaps the biggest reason is because of evil: how long can I put off dying? how long must I endure this pain? how long is the bad stuff going to last? Humans have a limited lifespan to get things done, so we try to synchronize schedules in order not to waste time. We have a limited endurance for boredom or pain, so before the use of anesthesia, the best surgeons were the quickest. In Bible times the Israelites complained that “The days are prolonged” (Eze 12:22) and the saints under the altar pleaded, “How long, O Lord?” (Rev 6:10). Although some complain that the Lord delays His coming (Mt 24:48; 2Pet 3:3,4,9), tribulations will be shortened or else none will be saved (Mt 24:22).\\nPerhaps another reason for the interest in time is that humans are bound by time and can’t move around in it as they can in space. The best they have is consciousness with a limited ability for such movement providing memories of past times and hopeful pictures of future times. Seventh-day Adventists show their great interest in time by having it as part of their name, referring to a recent seven-day creation in the past and a soon-coming advent of Christ in the future.\\nWithin this philosophical and theological context of time, the next sections discuss geological time as determined by radiometric dating: (1) how the technique works well and (2) some young-earth creationist responses.\\nRADIOMETRIC DATING WORKS\\nGeology observations about the relation between different rocks can give relative ages, but radiometric dating is the primary method for giving absolute ages. The basic concept of radiometric dating is simple. During a certain length of time called a half-life, half of the radioactive parent atoms in a sample decay to stable daughter atoms. The number of both parent and daughter atoms are measured and the higher the daughter/parent ratio, the older the sample. The exact age is easily determined with a simple equation.\\nOf the many radioactive parent-daughter pairs of atoms, about half a dozen are used for age dating. They can be divided into two types. (a) Organic: Carbon-14 methods can date organic material such as bones, wood, and shells directly. With a half-life of about 5000 years, it is mainly useful for archaeology and not expected to give reliable ages beyond about ten half-lives or about 50,000 years. (b) Inorganic: Rubidium decaying to strontium, potassium decaying to argon, uranium and thorium decaying to lead, and [sometimes] samarium decaying to neodymium are used to date inorganic minerals and rocks. In most cases, these rocks are not fossil-containing sedimentary rocks, but are volcanic, granitic, or metamorphic. These inorganic methods date fossil material only by association and give ages of millions or billions of years.\\nThe resulting ages are based on several assumptions: (a) the decay rate has been constant; (b) the original number of parent and daughter atoms in a sample can be estimated; and (c) the system [bone, wood, mineral, rock, etc] has not lost or gained parent or daughter atoms after the time of the event being dated, except by radioactive decay. In many cases these assumptions seem to be valid, and when they are not it is often obvious. For example, loss or gain of parent or daughter atoms might be expected if the sample shows signs of mechanical breakdown, chemical weathering, or metamorphic high pressures and temperatures.\\nFollowing are three of the many reasons that scientists put confidence in radiometric dates:\\n(1) Decay rates appear to be constant. (a) The strong force that governs nuclear decay rates is several orders of magnitude greater than the electromagnetic force that governs atomic interactions at even the highest temperatures and pressures found on earth. Only at the high temperatures in the interior of stars would the decay rates be expected to change significantly. (b) If the decay rate increased, atoms such as uranium, thorium, and samarium that decay by emitting alpha [helium nuclei] particles would have higher alpha emission energies. The alpha particles would then travel further in the mineral and damage a larger spherical halo in the mineral lattice. Such large halos have been searched for, but no significant examples have been found.\\n(2) Many types of radioactive atoms are known, but all primordial ones have half-lives greater than 450 million years and none have half-lives less than that. [Any atom found in nature with a shorter half-life, such as carbon-14 or radon, is being produced by on-going nuclear reactions.] The 450 million-year value is significant because it is one tenth the estimated age of the solar system. After ten half-lives the number of parent atoms decreases by a factor of about a thousand, and it is generally accepted that the number of parent atoms remaining in nature would be negligible. The natural occurrence of radioactive atoms thus seems to confirm the age of the solar system.\\n(3) Often several different parent-daughter pairs give concordant (similar) ages for a given rock or mineral. In one example from Saskatchewan in Canada, radiometric dates were determined for multiple samples from each of four minerals in a bentonite clay that was formed by the weathering of volcanic ash. The rubidium-strontium, potassium-argon, and uranium-lead decay pairs all gave ages of 72.5±0.2 million years.\\nCREATIONIST RESPONSES\\nFirst are several suggestions for young earth creationists studying radiometric dating: (a) work within the scientific community and use caution when making scientific claims; (b) work toward a constructive alternative model, more than just attacking existing models; (c) address the big picture, more than scattered discrete pieces of data; (d) don’t expect quick “silver bullet” proofs for the Bible; and (e) origins activities are one-time events, so don’t expect any origins research to fit a purely naturalistic scientific model.\\nUsing the current understanding of radiometric dating, it is difficult to fit the data into a one-year flood a few thousand years ago; however, creationists have given a number of responses that are here divided into eight categories:\\n(1) The radiometric age data is bad. – Perhaps it is mainly concordant dates that get published and discordant dates are ignored. Occasionally however, even discordant dates can be found in the literature. For example in a 1969 article, volcanic rock from Mt. Rangitoto in New Zealand gave potassium-argon ages of hundreds of thousands of years, but trees destroyed by the lava gave carbon-14 ages of hundreds of years.\\n(2) Geochemistry suggests alternate time interpretations for the parent-daughter ratios. – (a) Radiometric ages for some minerals may not give the time of emplacement of the volcanic or granitic rock because the minerals were formed earlier and the emplaced magma was not hot enough to melt them. (b) The radiometric chronometer was not reset to zero by the liquid magma because not all daughter atoms were excluded from the crystallizing mineral or rock. (c) The slope of the straight line isochron through the age data is not due to radioactive decay over time, but to the mixing of two magmas with different compositions.\\n(3) Decay rates have changed. – A few creationists suggest that a change in the speed of light resulted in changed decay rates. Some creationists note that the decay rates in rocks on earth may vary slightly due to bombardment by solar neutrinos. Other creationists propose speeded-up decay rates to explain rocks containing more than the expected amount of helium, if uranium were decaying at only present-day rates.\\n(4) Relativity suggests that time is not absolute. – Special relativity finds that time moves at different rates in reference frames traveling at close to the speed of light with respect to each other. General relativity indicates that time moves slower in strong gravitational fields, and this has been suggested as an explanation for an apparent old age for the universe.\\n(5) Radiometric ages can’t be right because other data suggests shorter ages. – (a) Paraconformities occur in the geologic column where sedimentary layers have a flat contact between them. Even if fossils and radiometric dates associated with the two layers suggest a significant time lapse, the flat contact seems to indicate rapid deposition with no time lapse between layers. (b) Good fossil and soft tissue preservation suggest rapid and recent burial that may not agree with radiometric ages of associated volcanic ash layers. (c) Carbon-14 is sometimes found in wood or coal that is traditionally expected to be much too old to still contain any short half-life carbon-14 atoms.\\n(6) Radiometric dates should be rejected for philosophical reasons. – (a) Extrapolation from a hundred years of knowledge about radioactive decay to millions of years for the age of the earth is problematic. (b) Geology is an historical science, unlike a laboratory science, and is not repeatable under known conditions. (c) A thousand times more scientists are studying the data from a long-age paradigm than from a short-age paradigm, so one would expect them to have better explanations. (d) Scientific revolutions have occurred in the past and perhaps such a paradigm shift in the future will be able to explain radiometric dates in a short time frame.\\n(7) An intermediate, partly old / partly young, model could explain the data. – Some have suggested that the inorganic material of the earth is indeed old, but then God came and created life recently. Thus the radiometric ages are valid, but do not actually give the age of the organic material.\\n(8) Supernatural intervention results in unexpected effects on time perception. – (a) At the end of creation week, Adam and Eve would have appeared as adults although they were only a few hours old. (b) God’s intervention in the Old Testament resulted in time anomalies when Aaron’s rod budded and produced almonds overnight, when Joshua commanded the sun to stand still for a day, and when the sun’s shadow moved backward ten degrees on Hezekiah’s sundial. (c) In the New Testament natural processes were speeded up when Christ turned water to wine, multiplied the loaves and fishes, and healed people.\\nIn conclusion: Radiometric dating has its uncertainties, but often seems to work well. At this point we don’t know how to relate its resulting ages with the Bible record, for we only know in part (I Cor 13:8-12). However, God’s ways are not our ways (Isa 55:8) and with God all things are possible (Mt 19:26; Lk 18:27).\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nBen Clausen\\nGeoscience Research Institute\\n                \\n                \\n                \\n                \\n            ', 'date': '2013-07-22', 'url': 'https://www.grisda.org/radiometric-dating-1'}, {'title': 'Flat Gaps Challenge Long Geologic Ages\\n', 'author': 'Ariel A.

The flat gaps in the sedimentary rocks of the earth provide scientific data that favor the biblical model.\\nIn the sedimentary layers of the earth, such as those of the Grand Canyon (see fig. 1), there are major gaps between some of the flat layers called flat gaps. One can tell there is such a gap because parts of the geologic column that are found elsewhere on the earth are missing at the gaps. However, the layers just above and below the gap lie flat right on top of each other and do usually not show any sign of modification or change in their aspect that could help identify the gap. Only by careful comparisons of sediments, fossils, and other factors beyond the gaps, can you tell that there is a gap. Geologists call these large flat gaps paraconformities. The duration of the gap is assumed, in accord with the standard geologic time scale, to sometimes represent hundreds of millions of years. The flat gaps are found among sedimentary layers over the earth and can extend over major parts of continents. In summary, the sedimentary record presents us with two important features: there are gaps and quite a number of them are flat.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\tFigure 1. Grand Canyon in Arizona. The arrows point to some flat gaps with the assumed duration of the gap given in millions of years (Ma). At the lowest arrow, both the Ordovician and Silurian periods are missing, yet the contact is nearly flat. Average continental rates of erosion during that time would be expected to erode down through two miles, which is twice the depth of the Grand Canyon.\\n\\t\\nThe flatness of these widespread gaps especially challenges the long geologic ages. Geologists who believe in long evolutionary time assume that the reason for a flat gap is that there has been no deposition of sediments over a flat region for many millions of years. On the other hand, if there is no deposition, erosion and weathering will be expected, and erosion tends to be highly irregular as seen now on the carved surfaces of our continents. \\n\\t\\nIn spite of their proposed long ages of formation, the flat gaps show very little or no weathering or erosion weathering or erosion of the underlying layers. This clearly indicates a different mechanism is responsible for their formation and is what would be expected in the context of rapid deposition during the astonishing Genesis Flood described in the Bible.\\nFOR FURTHER STUDY\\n1.

This is the consequence of your not defining the difference between life and death on the biochemical level.\\nYou seem to be saying that if molecules had the capacity to come together spontaneously to form a living entity once, then such should happen again and again.

But the biochemical basis of life is not structural so much as a dynamic non-equilibrium steady state.\\nIn previously published material [1] I describe the case of the E. coli cell that was just killed by a drop of toluene. This dead cell still has all of its proteins, nucleic acids, etc., in their perfect organizational state (in “irreducible complexity”, if you will, ala Behe) — the only thing wrong with this cell is that it is also irreducibly dead! Why? Because the breach of the cell’s cytoplasmic membrane resulted in a loss ATP synthesis and all chemical reactions went to equilibrium. That is what death on the cellular level is about.\\nI describe further how the life of such cell can be restored. Simply reset the non-equilibrium statuses of all reactions. This can be achieved by simultaneously providing the starting materials of all biochemical pathways and preventing the end products from accumulating.\\nWe can have molecules self-assemble until we are blue in the face.

This article provides a state-of-the-art appraisal of ancient Near Eastern chronologies in Mesopotamia and Egypt. It focuses on recent developments in both fields by assessing the current astronomical and historical bases for these chronologies and addressing the relative nature of chronology before the second millennium B.C. It documents the trend over the past sixty years to shorten the historical chronology of the Near East. This causes a widening gap between historical dates and the most recent data from 14C samples. This data has major implications for lengthening certain historical and prehistoric periods. The impasse between the historical methods of dating and 14C dating will then be evaluated.\\n\\nThe chronologies of Mesopotamia and Egypt are often cited as a basis for substantiating a long history and prehistory for the development of civilization in the Near East. It is often on the basis of the archaeological evidence that the arguments are made for the reinterpretation of the biblical chronological data (Kitchen 1966:36-37; Geraty 1974:16; Archer 1979:361; Blocher 1984:215-219; Stek 1990:223-225; Thompson 1991:228-229; Taylor 2000:98; Guy 2003:8). Recent archaeological and anthropological research has produced new data for the chronologies of Mesopotamia and Egypt. This study will evaluate: (1) whether the Egyptian and Mesopotamian history is set in an absolute framework; (2) some recent developments in the study of these chronologies and the trends for either lengthening or shortening the chronology; and (3) the relationship between 14C dating and Near Eastern chronologies and how this relationship is currently understood. The purpose of this essay is to provide a state-of-the-art discussion of Near Eastern chronology and its interface with 14C dating in order to assess the framework upon which scholars place the events of early history.\\n\\nMESOPOTAMIAN CHRONOLOGY\\n\\nThe chronology of Mesopotamia is often spoken of as being “fixed” by astronomical observations. That is, when a scribe recorded a king’s name in conjunction with a datable natural occurrence, such as an eclipse, that date may be referred to as absolute or “exact”. For example an inscription from the tenth year of the Assyrian king Aššur-Dan III refers to an eclipse of the sun, and by precise astronomical calculations it can be determined that the eclipse must have occurred on June 14/15, 763 B.C. (Glass 1984:92; Millard 1994:2). Because of the existence of eponym lists which provide a complete sequence of events in the reigns of various Assyrian kings (Ungnad 1938a; 1938b; Millard 1994) it is possible to derive from this one fixed date an absolute chronology extending back to 910 B.C. It is important to observe that “when attempting to go back further in time than the first millennium, however, one encounters problems” for “it is not possible to simply extend the absolute dates of the first millennium back into the second millennium” (Glass 1984:92). The second millennium dates are decidedly relative. Furthermore, two historical gaps of unknown duration occur between the sixteenth and twenty-fourth centuries B.C. the former “at about 2000 B.C., the latter about 1600 B.C.” so that “specific incidents and entire eras remain unanchored in absolute time” (Glass 1984:92; his italics). Before that “only approximate dates are possible: time estimations are derived from purely archaeological evidence, from paleographic data...and by all toofew radiocarbon dates” (Knapp 1992:716).\\n\\nOne reason that Mesopotamian historical chronology during the second and third millennium B.C. has faced increasing complexity concerns the cycle in which astronomical movement occurs. The discovery of the Venus tablet by Henry Austin Layard, and translated by Rawlinson and Smith (1870) received considerable attention (the history is documented by Langdon, Fotheringham and Schoch 1928:28-44; cf. Reiner and Pingree 1975) for mentioning the year formula for year 8 of Ammisaduqa. That tablet has become one of the key pieces of evidence to fix the chronology of the early second millennium B.C. by astronomical means (Poebel 1942; Rowton 1960; Huber 1987:5). Since the planetary movements of Venus occur in cycles of 56 or 64 years (Ungnad 1940), they offer a series of possible dates rather than an agreed upon single date (Knapp 1992:716). Kugler (1912) concluded that the following years were candidates for Ammisaduqa Year 1: -2040, -1976, -1856. He settled for a middle chronology date of -1976, but later on preferred an -1800 solution (Kugler 1924; 622-627; Huber 1987:5). The next year five dates (-1976, -1920, -1856, -1808, -1800) were considered by Langdon, Fotheringham and Schoch before they settled on -1920 (1928:61-62; Huber 1987:6). Hence, experts differentiate between three and up to five distinctive chronologies for the second millennium: the ultra-high (Landsberger 1954), [1] the high (Goetze 1951; 1957; Thureau-Dangin 1942; Huber 1982; 1987), [2] the middle (Kugler 1912; S. Smith 1940; 1945; Rowton 1962), [3] the low (Albright 1956; Cornelius 1956; cf. Aström 1987), [4] and the ultralow (Weidner 1945-51). [5] These competing chronologies allow for up to 226 years of flexibility.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of astronomical and historical reckoning for the period under discussion some experts have suggested that alternative methods be used for formulating the chronology of ancient Mesopotamia. While none would presume to limit or diminish the value and usefulness of historical chronology, 14C dating has been suggested as a means to verify or supplement historical reckoning (Rowton 1960; Mellaart 1979; Hassan and Robinson 1987). [6]\\n\\nMesopotamian Chronology and 14C Dating. Several attempts have been made to correlate 14C dating with the historical chronology of Mesopotamia (Rowton 1960; Mellaart 1979; Hassan and Robinson 1987; Schwartz and Weiss 1992). Arguments for a middle and ultra-high chronology have been posited. [7] The most extensive correlation of 14C dating and historical chronology was published in 1979 by James Mellaart. Mellaart outlines three basic chronological schools, which according to our terminology would have been the ultra-high, middle, and low chronologies. In his view “historical chronologies are a unique record from the past, they cannot and should not be ignored, but they have not come down to us in such a perfect state that only one chronological interpretation — the middle chronology — is possible. In the 1950s this may indeed have seemed the best choice: in 1979 it is not” (1979:11). Thus he proposes to utilize calibrated 14C dates which would support the ultra-high chronology (1979:11).\\n\\nThe 14C dates Mellaart cites are derived primarily from timber samples. The first dates for Shamshi-Adad come from his temple at Tell Rimah followed by Dinkha IVC which Mellaart claims is contemporary with the stratum at Tell Shemshara in which an archive of the period of Shamshi-Adad was found (1979:12). [8] They were published as follows:\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe second set of dates derives from samples found in the Acemköy palaces. The burnt debris of the destruction contained, among others, bullae of Shamshi-Adad (1979:12). The other four dates come from two Kültepe Ib period buildings in western Anatolia. The dates for Shamshi-Adad I were published as follows:\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRadiocarbon dates for the Ur III period are supplied from several sites. The date from Warka is taken from a sample of reeds attributed to the reign of Ur-Nammu. The date for Nippur Level IV is attributed to the reigns of Shu-Sin and Ibbi-Sin. The sample from Godin III is attributed to the beginning of the Ur III period, while the sample from Selenkahiye seems to date squarely within the Ur III period. The dates corresponding to the Ur III period were published as follows (1979:13):\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nProblems of Correlation. Based on these dates Mellaart concludes that “the so-called dilemma [between historical chronology and 14C dating] then is a myth, a creation of supporters of the middle and low chronologies” (1979:18). However, his conclusions have met with vigorous resistance among Assyriologists and Egyptologists (Kemp 1980; MunnRankin 1980; Weinstein 1980). Before addressing these criticisms it is first necessary to make several general observations:\\n\\nThe first issue is the dating of the stratigraphy of Kültepe II and Ib. Mellaart’s 14C dates from Kültepe imply that the two strata (II and Ib) together have spanned a period of three or four hundred years (20101720 B.C.; 1979:13). However, from historical records, economic transactions from the trading colonies at the site, it is known that these periods of occupation could not have lasted longer than 175 years (Larsen 1976). Mellaart recognizes the problem but provides no explanation. He maintains that the 14C dates support Shamshi-Adad’s reign on the ultra-high chronology (ca. 1953-1921 B.C.), but the 300-year span suggested by the dates (2010-1720 B.C.) could also support a middle or low chronology. Mellaart also does not seem to be aware that there are actually five possible historical solutions to the information given on the Venus Tablet. He does not mention the “actual” high chronology accepted most widely (Goetze 1951; 1957; Thureau-Dangin 1942; Huber et al. 1982; 1987; Tuman 1987; cf. Munn-Rankin 1980:129) and instead argues for the ultra-high chronology of Landsberger (1954) which remains virtually unaccepted. His extreme position is forced because of the 14C dates. Rather than attempting to solve the real problem of correlation he disregards the fact that the ultra-high chronology does not conform to the possible dates of the Venus cycle.\\n\\nMellaart has been criticized by historians and archaeologists as well (Kemp 1980; Munn-Rankin 1980; Weinstein 1980). According to the Assyriologist Munn-Rankin (1980:128) Mellaart makes the incorrect assumption that absolute dates can be assigned to third millennium dynasties by reckoning back from the first dynasty of Babylon. She points out that prior to the Third Dynasty of Ur, there is a paucity of independent evidence against which to assess the King Lists. The situation seems more complex than Mellaart admits.\\n\\nMellaart also makes the assumption that the Kassites ruled for 576 years after the destruction of Babylon by the Hittites. Munn-Rankin argues that this is incorrect (1980:128). This number is only given on King List A, dated to the seventh century B.C., and in no text is the beginning of this dynasty explicitly connected with the raid of Muršili I (Brinkman 1968). The end of the Kassite dynasty has most recently been dated to 1155 (Brinkman 1976; cf. 1980).\\n\\nMellaart does not seem to be well acquainted with the complexities of reckoning chronological sequences from historical information. At one point he states that the only Near Eastern countries from which there are King Lists are Egypt and Babylonia. He does not seem aware that the historical reckoning of the period prior to 1450 B.C. is based primarily on the Assyrian King Lists (Poebel 1942; Weidner 1926; 194551; Gelb 1954) and that the Mesopotamian chronology hinges on Assyrian records for its chronological framework (Knapp 1992; Grayson 1992a; 1992b). Furthermore, the Akkadian King List remains the essential source of historical reconstruction for the third millennium B.C. (This is precisely the period he is assessing.)\\n\\nMellaart should be commended for his attempt to correlate the two apparently contradictory sources of information for the dating of early Mesopotamian periods. However, it seems apparent that this most recent attempt to reconcile 14C dating and historical chronology fails to provide any conclusive new evidence. The 14C dates were consistently too high for even the “ultra-high” chronology which completely lacks support from the Venus data and archaeological stratification. This is the case for other periods as well. Moreover, revised 14C dates would suggest that the Uruk period, which conventionally begins around 3500 BC, “may have to be pushed back four or even five hundred years” (Crawford 1991:18; cf. Moorey 1987). The question remains whether the numerous variables and problems have been solved to the point where 14C dating can be viable for the historical chronology of the ancient Near East. [9]\\n\\nEGYPTIAN CHRONOLOGY\\n\\nThe chronology of Mesopotamia and much of the remainder of the ancient Near East has been linked with Egyptian absolute dating (Knapp 1992:716). During the historic/dynastic period written sources in Egypt include king lists, royal annals, and biographic treatises (Redford 1986; Kantor 1992; Ward 1992). In the early twentieth century, W. F. Petrie, the recognized founder of Egyptology and the archaeological principles of stratigraphy and superimposition, published the beginning of the historic/dynastic period (Dynasty I) at 5510 BC (Petrie 1906:175). His conclusions were based primarily on “the authority of the Turin papyrus and of Manetho,” for “it is only reasonable to accept those lists as substantially accurate” (Petrie 1906:175). Other noted Egyptologists later placed Dynasties I and II at 3425-3000 BC (Weigall 1910: xvii) or 34002980 BC (Breasted 1916:419). It is significant that the most extensive adjustments have occurred in the Old Kingdom where relative dates allow for more change due to the length of the First Intermediate Period. However, the last century of Egyptological research, expanded by incredible amounts of new data from excavations and textual studies, has raised serious questions not only for the length of the historic periods, but also for the absolute nature of early dates. Several serious questions have been raised which necessitate revisions for the traditional absolute chronology prior to the Egyptian New Kingdom (Ward 1992:55).\\n\\nManetho as an Authority for Egyptian Chronology. During the third century B.C. a “history of Egypt” was written in Greek by a priest named Manetho (Waddell 1940; Helck 1956). It seemed almost certain that Manetho had compiled his history from some of the same lists that modern historians use for the reconstruction of Egyptian chronology (Knapp 1992:716). In spite of early reliance on Manetho (Petrie 1906; Weigall 1910; Breasted 1916 and others) and attempts to legitimize it as dependable (Helck 1956), an increasing number of errors and inaccuracies have been discovered (Redford 1986:231-332). This has caused some historians to abandon this tradition altogether (Wente and van Siclen 1976:217-218; Ward 1984:155-156) or to show that dependence on Manetho is not necessary, “at least not for the chronology of the new kingdom and later” (Hornung 1987). Because of these problems “his work ceased to be the basis of Egyptian chronology many decades ago” (Kitchen 2000:39). New evidence on the length of reigns and the existence of co-regencies have contributed to the abandonment of Manetho as a credible source.\\n\\nNew Evidence on the Length of Reigns. New data about the length of certain reigns have caused revisions. For example, it has been established that Sesostris III reigned for 19 years rather than 39 as previously thought (Simpson 1972; 1984; cf. Kitchen 1992:329; 2000), and Amenemhet IV for 13 rather than nine years (Beckerath 1976:50). During the 19th Dynasty, Merenptah reigned no more than ten years rather than Manetho’s 19 (Bierbrier 1975:118 note 2; on Merenptah’s reign and see Hasel 1994; 1998; 2003; 2004). The general tendency of new data that has come to light supports a shortening rather than lengthening of the chronology.\\n\\nThe Question of Coregencies. The matter of coregencies remains unresolved (Ward 1992:54). One example will suffice. A short coregency between Thutmose III and Amenhotep II is often assumed (see Casperson 1986). Redford (1966:120) allows one and a third years, Wente and van Siclen (1976:227-228) two and a third years as does Murnane (1977:4457) who insists that this coregency is “remarkably well attested.” Krauss, on the other hand, (1978:174-175) allows for no such coregency. The existence of coregencies would also shorten Egyptian chronology which has tended to place rulers in consecutive rather than overlapping succession.\\n\\nAstronomical Bases for Egyptian Chronology. Finally, the most serious challenge to traditional chronology is the interpretation of astronomical data preserved in Egyptian texts (Neugebauer 1929; 1974; Hayes 1970; Barta 1979/80; Krauss 1985; Leitz 1989). This is a complex matter that has likewise given rise to a high, middle, and low chronology (Kitchen 1987; 1992; 2000). Like Mesopotamian chronology, the later dates of the New Kingdom are much more reliable than earlier dates because of more Egyptian documentation (Ward 1992:55), but unlike Mesopotamia “no relevant account of a solar eclipse survived from ancient Egypt” (Brein 2000:54). Dates are based largely on the calendrical system, whether this was according to agricultural (Neugebauer 1938), lunar, stellar (Krauss 1985), or civil years (Gardiner 1945; Parker 1950; Barta 1983).\\n\\nThe beginning of the Egyptian lunar year was tied to the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (_pd.t was rendered Sôthis by the Greeks; Ward 1992:58-59; Krauss 1998; Brein 2000:53). The lunar and civil years were not opposed or in competition with each other (Ward 1992:57). The sidereal year (presided over by Sirius) is slightly more than a quarterday longer than the civil calendar. Thus modern scholars have called the civil year the “wandering year” (Barta 1979/80; 1983; Beckerath 1986) since it regularly progressed backward so that the civil New Year’s Day eventually fell on every first day of the sidereal year. The resulting period of 1460 years (365 x 4) is called the “Sothic Cycle”. In reality the “Sothic Cycle” is somewhat shorter and scholars now use a figure of 1456 years (Hornung 1964:18; Ingham 1969). “Only six references to the heliacal rising of Sirius suitable for astrochronology survived in Egyptian sources” (see the references by Brein 2000:54-55).\\n\\nSeveral factors influence dating by the rising of Sirius. The arcus visionis is the angle between Sirius and the sun when the star is first observed. The point of observation is not the horizon. Modern calculations show that the angle is 7.5 degrees, with Sirius 2 degrees above the horizon and the sun 5.5 degrees below it. The time of observation will cause variations in this angle and hence also the chronological conclusions drawn from assuming a 7.5 degree angle. Another problem in reckoning time concerns the tetraeteris, the four-year phase during which the heliacal rising was observed on the same day of the year. Every four years the phase moved backward one day and it is not possible to determine in which of the four years of the tetraeteris a given observation took place (Ward 1992:58).\\n\\nThe most significant variable for astronomical calculations was where in Egypt such observations took place. As one moves south along the Nile, for every degree of latitude the heliacal rising is observed one day earlier. In terms of absolute chronology this means a reduction by four years per day per degree of latitude (Ward 1992:59). Due to this realization Egyptologists have proposed three possible locations for the observation of the heliacal rising of Sirius, namely Memphis or Heliopolis (Leitz 1989), Thebes (Ward 1992:59), and Elephantine (Krauss 1981; 1985; 1998; Franke 1988). Since there are about six degrees of latitude between Memphis/Heliopolis and Elephantine (Brein 2000:55; Krauss 1985:38-49), these three locations in turn have established three possible chronologies (Kitchen 1987; 1992:324-325; 2000), a high chronology (Sothic sighting in Memphis/Heliopolis; Leitz 1989; Ward 1992), a middle and low chronology (Sothic sighting from Thebes; Hornung 1964:20-21; Kitchen 1987:42-43) and an ultra-low chronology (Sothic sighting at Elephantine; Krauss 1985; 1998; Wells 1985; Franke 1988).\\n\\nThe effect for the 12th Dynasty would be divergence of 42 years (Kitchen 1987:45). W. A. Ward of Brown University maintains that due to these factors “precision is impossible when the sightings of the lunar crescent, for example, are individual interpretations of purely sensory data.” In fact, this respected Egyptologist states that the “‘precision’ assumed by present-day scholarship is an illusion” (1992:62). While the astronomical evidence is important for Egyptian chronology, the most recent assessment is that “at the moment it seems impossible to gain reliable fixed absolute dates of Egyptian history by means of astrochronology alone” (Brein 2000:56) “these merely help to limit the options in fine detail” (Kitchen 2000:39).\\n\\nFrom these observations it must be understood that Egyptian chronology before the New Kingdom is increasingly relative. This has resulted in a great deal of adjustment over the past century as new evidence has come to light. The tendency, on the basis of new archaeological and historical evidence has been to drastically shorten the chronology of dynastic Egypt. As outlined above, this may be due to the adjustment in the length of reigns, in assuming co-regencies, and on the basis of astronomical data.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBased on this new archaeological and textual evidence, today the date for the beginning of the Egyptian historical period falls anywhere from 3050 (Kemp 1989:14) to as low as 2950 B.C. (Beckerath 1997: 187). [10] In other words, the chronology of dynastic Egypt has been reduced from Petrie’s original suggestion by as much as 2,560 years while Breasted’s chronology has been reduced more than 400 years by this new evidence in a total time-span that lasts only 2,346 years (see chart below; Taharqa was the last Egyptian king of Upper and Lower Egypt, 664 BC, Kitchen 2000:39). This is a significant reduction in time. One should not underestimate its significance for further refinements. The discovery of a single new monument may cause untold further refinement in the discipline (Ward 1992:62).\\n\\nRadiocarbon Dating and Egyptian Chronology. Since the inception of 14C dating in 1949, attempts have been made to correlate 14C dates with the well-known historical dates in ancient Egypt. The publications stating positive results by Willard Libby, the inventor of the method (Libby 1955; 1963), were optimistic but, in the end, gained little support among Egyptologists (Hayes 1970; H. S. Smith 1964; Edwards 1970; Long 1976). This was due to more precise historical dates in the Egyptian New Kingdom (Kitchen 2000:39) and significant differences between the 14C dates and the historical dates for the Old Kingdom (Bowman 1990:16). Several factors accounted for this. First, early 14C dates reflected a half-life assigned to them by Libby (5568 +30 yrs. BP; 1955). This was later adjusted to 5730 +/40 years BP (Hole and Heizer 1973:252; Schwartz and Weiss 1992:189). Second, calibration had not yet been introduced (Bowman 1990:43-49; Clark and Renfrew 1973; Johnson 1973; Clark 1978; Pearson 1987), nor had it been refined (Shaw 1985; Hassan and Robertson 1987; Stuiver and Pearson 1986; Stuiver et al. 1998).\\n\\nEven after these important adjustments were introduced and calibrations refined, the present status has not changed significantly. The impasse continues between Egyptologists, Assyriologists, and those working in 14C dating. [11] According to the recent state-of-the-art articles from the Near East Chronology Symposium held in Jerusalem, Israel published in Radiocarbon (2001), the 14C dates still vary significantly from historical dating. Bruins and van der Plicht (2001) show in a detailed case that high-quality stratified 14C dates from Early Bronze Jericho are “100-300 years older than conventional archaeo-historical time estimates” (Bruins 2001:1151). Braun (2001:1279) concludes from another study that also resulted in high 14C dates that “the logical outcome of an acceptance of these new dates [from the southern Levant and Egypt] puts such a strain on chronological correlations between the 14C data and the archaeological record, that the entire system would no longer be tenable if accepted.” Despite the cautionary remarks by Braun, Bruins (2001:1151) submits that “the new 14C evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of an older Early Bronze Age and older dates for Dynasties 1-6.”\\n\\nIn fact, it is precisely the 14C dates that have increased the estimates of ages in prehistoric periods. Bruins and van der Plicht (2001:1330) write:\\n\\nAs a result of 14C dating, the latter periods have indeed ‘become’ much older. In the 1950s and early 1960s, when Albright (1960) wrote the above time assessments, it became quite fashionable to assign the Chalcolithic on archaeological estimates to about 4000-3100 BC and EB-I to about 3100-2900 BC. However, 14C dating has changed the picture completely! The Chalcolithic is now understood to have begun almost 1000 years earlier, close to 5000 BC-I. The transition between the Chalcolithic and EB-I has also been pushed back by many hundreds of years to somewhere in the early to mid-4th millennium. [12]\\n\\nThis statement demonstrates that the most recent calibrated 14C data from the ancient Near East continues to push the prehistory of the region further back in time. Bruins supports this trend and goes on to suggest that 14C data should act as a corrective to early dynastic Egyptian history. In a paper presented to the American Schools of Oriental Research Bruins went over the recent publication of 14C dates from 170 samples from building materials associated with the pyramids (Bonani et al. 2001:1297). The samples related to the Great Pyramid of Cheops, sent to two different labs, resulted in 45 % of calibrated dates ranging from 2783-2715 with a 95.4 % probability (Bruins 2003). Since this remains 200-300 years higher than the modern dates of this ruler, Bruins suggested that the 14C dates be used as a corrective to Egyptian chronology and that Egyptologists should consider reverting to the chronology of Breasted proposed nearly a century ago.\\n\\nIn contrast, the present essay documents an increased caution among Egyptologists, Near Eastern archaeologists, and historians concerning the relative dates of the third millennium in Mesopotamia and Egypt. The revision proposed by Bruins ignores a century of scholarship and new data that has led to a significant decrease in the early dynastic history of Egypt during the past 40 years. This reduction points to the possibility that further refinements may yet come.\\n\\nThe dilemma between 14C dating and historically based chronology has not been resolved. But the more serious question that has not yet been adequately addressed is this: If 14C data remains imprecise and exceedingly high for the early historical periods and correlations fail where astronomical dates for verification exist, does this not cast serious doubt as to their value for the prehistoric periods when “they deviate increasingly from actual calendar dates: from a 200-year error around 1000 B.C. up to a 900-year error around 5000 B.C.” (Knapp 1992:715)? This question is one that will need to be addressed in the continuing debate over the relationship between Near Eastern chronology and 14C dating.\\n\\nENDNOTES\\n\\n[1] The ultra-high chronology proposed by B. Landsberger (1954) has not gained much support (Hallo and Simpson 1971:103; Dever 1992:11). The difficulty is that this chronology does not correspond well with the evidence of reigns at Alalakh (Albright 1956) or with the current consensus of Hittite chronology (Astour 1989). Most importantly, it does not agree with any of the solutions required by the Venus Tablets. No solutions are said to be available between 1947 and 1848 (Rowton 1960: 98). Thus it has been pointed out by almost all involved in the discussion that this chronology is far too high to be considered possible (but see Mellaart 1979).\\n\\n[2] The high chronology was first suggested by D. Sidersky (1941) and continues to be supported and defended (Goetze 1951; 1957; Thureau-Dangin 1942; Huber et al. 1982; Huber 1987; Tuman 1987). Most recently Huber (1987) has made a convincing case for this position on the basis of statistical analysis. According to Huber, “If we assume that one of the four Venus chronologies is correct, the odds favoring the Long chronology over the other three are about 1000 to 1. If we drop the assumption that one of them is true, we can still assert that the long one is correct, with a probability of error below 1%” (1987:5). Tuman (1987) has also argued on the basis of astrological omens and lunar eclipses that the long chronology must be correct. Others have argued strongly against the high chronology (Rowton 1960; Kitchen 1987). The statement made by Tiglath-Pileser I that the temple of Anu and Adad, built by ShamshiAdad, son of Ishme-Dagan, had become dilapidated after 641 years provides an important Distanzangabe. Figuring back from Tiglath-Pileser’s sixth year and adding 641 should result in the date of Shamshi-Adad’s first year (Naeaman 1984:117-118). The problem is that this does not correlate well with either the ultra-high or high chronologies (Rowton 1960:110; Naeaman 1984). Furthermore, Rowton has shown that the high chronology requires totals (of years) which on the generation count are far in access of the average (1960:100-101). Nevertheless, the high chronology remains possible on the basis of the Venus Tablets and continues to be a viable option.\\n\\n[3] The Middle Chronology has the most supporters (Kugler 1912; S. Smith 1940; 1945; Rowton 1960; 1962; Porada et al. 1992; Schwarz and Weiss 1992). Some believe that the middle chronology is a convenient compromise or balance between two extremes (Mellaart 1979). However, such statements can be rather misleading. The majority of scholars who have written on the chronology of Mesopotamia have opted for this position (S. Smith 1940; 1945; Rowton 1960; 1962; Porada et al. 1965; 1992; Schwartz and Weiss 1992). There are valid reasons for choosing the middle chronology. The chronological statement by Tiglath-Pileser I supports it (Naeaman 1984:122). Some have argued that the negative evidence against other chronologies also need to be considered (Rowton 1960:110-111). Certainly it has valid support from the Venus Tablets and other synchronisms of the period, especially Egypt (Kitchen 1987).\\n\\n[4] The low chronology was first proposed by W. F. Albright (1942) and followed by others (Cornelius 1956; cf. Aström 1987; Dever 1992). Albright sought to revise the “apparently stabilized” (1942:28) Babylonian chronology on the basis of the Khorsabad King List which appeared in that same year (Poebel 1942). While previously defending the then low chronology of S. Smith (1940), Albright saw the need to further lower the chronology based on the new list. He correlated the reigns of Asshur-ubalit I of Assyria (dated by the Khorsabad King List to 1362-1327 B.C.) and Amenhotep IV of Egypt (1942:30). He thus dates the reign of Shamshi-Adad I about 1726 = 20 or ca. 1746 B.C. In an analysis of the Venus Tablets Albright descended another 275 years below Langdon, Fotheringham and Schoch (1928) and placed Hammurapi’s reign at 1728-1686 B.C. He used the usual correlations with Zimri-Lim of Mari (whom Hammurapi defeated in his 32nd year). He later defended the low chronology again, this time going to stratigraphic evidence from the archaeological excavations at Alalakh (Albright 1956). Stratum VI provided the key, according to Albright, since the ceramics from this stratum dated to 1550-1450. In Stratum VII texts were found corresponding to the reign of four kings. Albright assumed that they ruled about 20 years each since all were a direct line of descent (1956: 28). The pottery from Stratum VII dated to the reign of the last king of that dynasty of Alalakh (ca. 1640 B.C.). The middle chronology for Hammurapi (1792-1750 B.C.) would then be excluded because it would push the fall of Alalakh back to about 1700. According to Albright, this was impossible from the standpoint of pottery and seals found in Alalakh Strata VII. Recent studies of Hittite chronology (Astour 1989) and specifically studies on the chronology of Alalakh Stratum VII (McClellen 1989) indicate that the chronological sequence of Woolley’s initial excavations demonstrate certain inconsistencies. Goetze (1951) argues against Albright that the high chronology seems to fit best. Gurney (1974) claims that any of the proposed chronologies would be compatible with Hittite chronology although the middle chronology cannot be invalidated by any new data. In the most recent treatment on Hittite history, the chronological scheme followed fell “within the Middle to Low range” (Bryce 1998:414).\\n\\n[5] The ultra-low chronology has been defended most recently by Weidner (1945-51), though others have suggested it in the past (Böhl 1946). Weidner also produced his chronology shortly after the Khorsabad King List was published (Poebel 1942). Weidner (1945-51) did not have access to Cornelius or Albright’s low chronology at the time of his formulation, but he preferred later to let his dates remain unchanged. The ultralow chronology seems to have no modern adherents. Nevertheless, unlike the ultrahigh chronology, it does fit within the cycle of Venus making it a possible candidate.\\n\\n; Rowton 1962), -1637, and -1581 (Albright 1956; Cornelius 1956).\\n\\n[7] Rowton (1960) first suggested that 14C dates from Nippur could aid in establishing a preferable chronology. He begins his argument by stating “Libby’s radio-carbon method can be used for relatively close dating when the sample has been put through an especially long run” (1960:97). Using two samples (charcoal and reed mat) from Nippur he begins by making a case for the middle chronology over against the ultrahigh, high, and low chronologies. He is careful to use other historical arguments for his case, but refers to the 14C dates in support of his conclusion (1960:110-111). The dates are as follows: Hammurapi accession year = 1757+/-106 (Charcoal); Hammurapi accession year = 1581+/-133 (Reed mat). Rowton cannot be faulted for publishing insufficient data for his time, since he used the best data available. However, the 14C dates which he provides cannot be accepted uncritically for the following reasons: (1) the dates are uncalibrated and, therefore, once calibrated, would not correlate with a middle chronology; and (2) the dates, as they stand, vary significantly enough to allow for a middle, low, or ultra-low chronology. They do not exclusively support the middle chronology. Rowton recognizes this and uses other arguments to account for the imprecision of the 14C dates. His main emphasis is to discredit the ultra-high and high chronologies. This seems well founded although the 14C dates are insufficient to stand alone.\\n\\n[8] Abbreviations: AJA = American Journal of Archaeology; B = Beycesultan; R = Radiocarbon.\\n\\n[9] Hassan and Robinson (1987) have provided the most recent contribution to the problem. Their study is primarily concerned with the chronology of ancient Egypt (1987:119-126), nevertheless, in their comparisons with Mesopotamian chronology they cite Mellaart with insignificant changes. They provide no new data for Mesopotamia. Their uncritical acceptance of Mellaart’s conclusions (1987:130) make their study suspect as well.\\n\\n[10] Other variations that fall between 3050 (Kemp 1989:14) and 2950 BC (Beckerath 1997:187) include: 3100/3000 (Kitchen 2000:48); 3000 BC (Murnane 1997:22).\\n\\n[11] For Egypt Weiner et al. (1995) state they are, “mistrustful.... [14C] dating does not often match with historical dating.” Egyptologist J. Weinstein (1989:101; cf. 1980) notes the “incompatibility between...radiocarbon dates and the archaeologic/historic dates of Mesopotamia and Egypt” and submits that “For the Middle and Late Bronze age, Iron age, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine periods, 14C dating has only limited value because the technique is less precise than the normally available archaeologic and historic materials” (Weinstein 1984:297). For the Aegean and Cyprus, P. Åström submits that they “are not useful for exact dating” (1986:39). R. Merrillees, then director of the Cyprus American Archaeological Research Institute (CAARI), concludes blandly “radiocarbon dates are invoked if they support a particular hypothesis...and dismissed if they do not” (1992:51). These are serious scholars who recognize the inaccuracies and difficulties that still prevail after fifty-five years of refining the method.\\n\\n[12] The support for this increase in time by 14C dating is summarized by A. Joffe and J. P. Dessel (1995; cf. Gilead 1994; Bourke et al. 2001; Burton and Levy 2001).\\n\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nAlbright WF. 1942. A third revision of the early chronology of Western Asia.

Snelling, and Eugene Chaffin (eds.). 2000. Santee, CA: Institute for Creation Research; and St. Joseph, MO: Creation Research Society. 676 p. Cloth, $49.95.\\nThis is an extraordinary book in many ways. It contains 47 pages of index, a 91-page glossary of specialized technical terms used in the book, and 56 pages of references to the professional scientific literature on the topics considered. A 66-page appendix outlines thirteen research projects for resolving critical questions raised in the text section The topics considered in the book are treated at a high level of technical sophistication by seven specialists, each of whom has a recognized doctorate in the area of his expertise. The authors have endeavored to provide thorough and accurate presentations of the various models that have been developed in the effort to understand the radiochemical features of planet Earth’s crust, together with a listing of the major associated references in the scientific literature. Highest quality printing and 73 excellent illustrations [1] contribute to a book of extraordinary value to the community of scholars. I rate Chapter 8 as essential reading for anyone who desires to understand radiohalos, and for anyone who wishes to make a presentation on radiohalos for the general public. Similarly I can designate Chapter 4 as priority reading for anyone who wishes to understand radioisotope age data.\\nAlthough the primary motivation for the preparation of this book is to foster development of compatible understanding of radioisotope data and the chronological specifications in the Bible, the book is a valuable resource for individuals who do not share this concern.\\nOn page 215 there is an example of the hazards faced by individuals with even the best reputation for effort to maintain high scientific standards. In a discussion on the Kambalda volcanics of Westem Australia, it is stated that “Although the whole suite yielded a good isochron ‘age’ of 2790 + 30 Ma, the mafic and ultramafic samples alone gave an older best-fit ‘age’ of 2910 + 170 Ma.” Since the range 2760-2820 is entirely enclosed within the range 2740-3080, these age determinations are actually in agreement. This statement on age difference is an exception to the general character of the book.\\nA more serious example of the extent to which conclusions may be influenced by an investigator’s initial bias is at the bottom of page 274: “... if there is one conclusive observation to be made, it is that the ‘ages’ derived from radioisotope systems can really only be regarded as maximum ages given the evidence of open-system behavior, mixing, inheritance, etc., ...” There are open-system processes that can reduce, as well as those that can increase a radioisotope ‘age’ characteristic. For example, heat could drive off argon, making the K-Ar ‘age’ younger than it was at the time of heating. Solution penetration could deposit potassium (or uranium), making the K-Ar (or the U-Pb) ‘age’ younger than it was at the time penetration occurred. A conviction regarding the age of the physical universe may prevent recognition of radioisotope age determinations that possibly have an unmodified relation to real time.\\nThe reference to “dual 210Po halos” in the third sentence on page 275 will cause confusion for some readers who are not acquainted with coalified-wood radiohalo phenomena. The 210Po radiohalo has only one ring. The sentence would convey the author’s intent better if it read “Furthermore, the presence of both elliptical and circular 210Po halos indicates that U infiltrated these strata at the time of, and soon after, deposition and rapid compaction.” This consideration is fully developed by the same author in a subsequent chapter (Chapter 8).\\nThe data treated in RADIOISOTOPES fully indicate that Earth’s crust contains concentrations of radiogenic isotopes many orders-of-magnitude greater than could have accumulated in 6000 years at present rates of radioactivity. The authors are organized as the RATE (Radioisotopes and the Age of The Earth) Group for investigation of the possibility that at some time(s) in the past radioisotope decay rates could have been orders-of-magnitude (possibly about five orders, which is 100,000 fold) greater than given by determinations made over the past century.\\nIn the process of transformation (decay) the nucleus of a radioactive isotope ejects a particle that has kinetic energy inversely proportional to the half-life of its parent. For example, the three daughters of uranium that produce most polonium radiohalos, 214Po, 218Po, and 210Po, have ha1f-lives of 164 microseconds, 3.1 minutes, and 138.4 days, respectively; and emit alpha-particles (Helium-4 nuclei) with kinetic energy 7.69, 6.00, and 5.3 Mev, respectively. The air-equivalent distances traversed by these alpha-particles in dissipating their kinetic energy are 7.03, 4.67, and 3.87 cm, respectively.\\nTo accommodate the observed abundances of fission-tracks and of radiohalos with postulated formation within a time-span in the order of 10,000 years, it must be presumed that radioisotope decay rates have been orders-of-magnitude greater than they are at present, without any significant difference in the energies of the particles ejected in the decay process. How can two isotopes of polonium be distinguished by related differences in their half-lives and the energies of the alpha-particles ejected in their decay, yet orders-of-magnitude changes in the half life of either of these isotopes be completely unrelated to the energy of its decay particle? This question is addressed in a theoretical chapter (Chapter 6). The author of this chapter concludes that reasonable changes may be postulated for energy relationships within the atomic nucleus that could produce orders-of-magnitude change in the decay probability (half-life) without significant change in the kinetic energy of the particles (fission products, or alpha particle) ejected in the decay. The appendix proposes research projects designed to seek for experimental confirmation of this speculation.\\nExegesis that includes the entire physical universe in the creation account of Genesis 1:1 2:4 (see Table 1, p 338) mandates the troublesome theoretical considerations addressed in Chapter 6. Exegesis on the basis of modern concepts associated with the Hebrew terms shamayim (heavens) and ‘eretz (earth) comes readily. Vastly greater freedom in seeking harmony with radioisotope and astrophysical data that has become available in the last century is obtained if exegesis is restricted to the definitions God, the Creator, gave for these crucial terms, as recorded in Genesis 1:8-10. [2]\\xa0\\nA discussion in RADIOISOTOPES regarding the initial geochemical makeup of planet Earth is conditioned by “the unequivocal Biblical statements that the Earth was in fact created before the Sun” (p 278). The highest commendation should be given to recognition of the significance inspired testimony (specifically, the Bible) has in the achievement of understanding the physical universe. There is danger of an unbalanced emphasis in the interaction between conclusions from properly conducted experimental observation and exegesis to determine the intent of inspired testimony. Only inspired testimony can convey assured knowledge concerning ultimate origins; but a study of related physical evidence (the RATE Group’s research programs, for example) may assist efforts to determine the intent of an inspired writer.\\nThe first two chapters of Genesis have been accepted as a record of revelation received by an intermediary (probably Moses). Genesis 1: 1-2 provide an introduction to this record, and also a statement concerning the nature of planet Earth’s surface at the beginning of Creation Week. A conclusion to the basic account is given in Genesis 2:4a. The intervening verses outline what an observer on the surface of the planet would have seen step by step during the creation process. On Day 4 the “Heaven” (vs 8, KJV) created on Day 2 cleared sufficiently to make celestial objects discernable from the “Earth” (vs 10, KJV) created on Day 3. Since the Hebrew language does not have a pluperfect tense, the statement in verse 16 may be taken to specify either that the celestial objects were created by God on Day 4, or that the celestial objects previously created by God became discernable from the surface of planet Earth on that day. A personal judgment is required as to which interpretation best accommodates the testimony throughout the Bible, together with the accumulated astrophysical and geochemical data.\\nSignificant inferences regarding the geological past may be drawn from helium concentration and the 3He/4He ratio in Earth’s atmosphere and crust, as discussed in Chapter 7. Individuals who are interested in helium considerations should also consult the article by R.H. Brown [1998. Unique enigmatic helium. ORIGINS 25(2):55-73].\\nAs I have already stated, this book provides a convenient survey of the radioisotope characteristics of planet Earth’s crust, and ready access to their treatment in the scientific literature. I have a severe problem with the suggestion that these characteristics might be accounted for by a 100,000-fold increase in nuclear instability over a short time within the past 10,000 years. Changes in the energy relationships within atomic nuclei would be expected to occur in all matter, and not be confined merely to isotopes that are unstable at present.\\nConsequently, in addition to a 100,000-fold increase in the radiation and particle emission from the nuclei that are presently unstable, a corresponding release from many of the nuclei that are now stable would be expected. The cumulative increase would be many times 100,000 fold.\\nOrganic life and the chemistry on which it is based would most likely be destroyed under such circumstances. Consequently the proposed increase in nuclear disintegration rates would be confined to the first two days of the Genesis 1 creation week (plus possibly a few hours of Day 3 before plant life was created). Therefore a postulation of higher decay rates over only the first two days is equivalent to a postulation that considers the radioisotope daughter features which presently characterize planet Earth to have been created in situ at the beginning, together with subsequent modifications of such. This alternative postulate does not involve either an increase in nuclear disintegration rates or development over long periods of time.

Principal examples are Fig. 3, p 62; Fig. 8, p 81; and Fig. 10, p 164. The legends for these figures are incomplete.\\n[2]The New International Version takes liberty to translate these terms differently in Gen. 1:1,2; 2:1,4 than in Gen. 1:8-10, imposing an interpretation that goes beyond straightforward exegesis.

Giem\\nLoma Linda, California\\nWHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT\\nThis article reviews the theoretical basis for expecting the presence of carbon-14 in Pliocene to Cambrian carbon from certain creationist viewpoints, and for expecting its absence from a viewpoint proposing a long age of life on Earth. The relevant experiments are discussed. Several conclusions emerge: 1) There is measurable carbon-14 in material that should be \"dead\" according to standard evolutionary theory; 2) machine error can be eliminated as an explanation for this carbon-14 on experimental grounds; 3) nuclear synthesis of this carbon-14 in situ  can be eliminated on theoretical grounds; 4) contamination of fossil material in situ is unlikely but theoretically possible, and is a testable hypothesis; 5) contamination during sample preparation is a significant problem but theoretically soluble; 6) residual activity is most likely indicated by the present data, and if correct, would eliminate an age greater than approximately 100,000 years for life on Earth; and 7) additional experimental evidence cannot eliminate either a short or a long age of life on Earth, but can provide evidence tending to discriminate between the two. \\nCLASSIFICATION OF MAJOR THEORIES OF EARTH HISTORY\\nThis paper deals with the presence of carbon-14 in fossil material and its implications for theories of the age of life on Earth. [1] For our purposes these theories can be divided into roughly three categories:\\n\\n\\n\\nTheories which assume that life has been on Earth for 1-4 billion years include mechanistic evolution, theistic evolution, multiple creations/progressive creation, and ruin-and-restoration theories.\\nTheories which assume that life has been on Earth for less than 100,000 years and that radiometric decay constants have remained constant during that time include various forms of special creationism. These include those placing the Flood at the time indicated by the Masoretic text of Genesis 11 (4,300-4,500 years ago), those dating the Flood by the Septuagint (5,500 years ago), and those placing the Flood at a somewhat more remote time (usually about 10,000-20,000 years ago).\\nTheories assuming that life has been on Earth for less than 100,000 years and that radiometric decay constants have not remained constant during that time include various forms of special creationism which may be quite similar to those mentioned in the second category, except for their view regarding decay constants. [2]\\n\\n\\n\\nThe predictions of the third category of theories regarding carbon-14 in fossil carbon (carbon from such sources as coal, oil, natural gas, wood, or bone) usually match those of the first category, although they are not logically required to do so. In fact, unless there are some constraints on how much radiometric constants may vary, the third category of theories cannot make any predictions whatever. In this paper we are concerned with theoretical predictions and their match with experimental evidence. Since the third category has difficulty making any predictions regarding carbon-14 in fossil carbon, it will be ignored here, not because we know it to be wrong, but because it is untestable.\\nLONG-AGE THEORIES PREDICT NO CARBON-14 IN GEOLOGICALLY OLD SAMPLES\\nIn the first category — long-age theories —, some rather definite predictions can be made about samples that are assigned an age greater than 100,000 years. No one assumes that the concentration of carbon-14 in ordinary carbon ( 14C/C ratio) in the biosphere has ever been more than 10× the present 14C/C ratio. One can accordingly establish a reasonable upper limit of 0.0056 percent modern carbon (pmc) for the 14C/C ratio in a 100,000-year-old specimen. Every 57,100 years the 14C/C ratio decreases by a factor of 1,000. A 200,000-year-old specimen should have a present 14C/C ratio of 0.000 000 031 pmc or less. By the time we get back to 300,000 years, a sample should have less than one atom of carbon-14 in a gram of carbon as residual activity. [3] This means that one million-year-old samples, or 350 million-year-old samples, should have no residual radiocarbon.\\nExplanations of measured radiocarbon in an old sample that are consistent with long-age theories might include carbon-14 created there by nuclear synthesis, carbon-14 from elsewhere contaminating the sample (either in the ground or during sample preparation), or machine error (the measuring device indicating the presence of carbon-14 in the sample when in fact there is none). These possible sources of error will be discussed below.\\nMOST SHORT-AGE CONSTANT-DECAY MODELS PREDICT A SMALL AMOUNT OF CARBON-14 (0.6 TO 0.005 PMC) IN GEOLOGICALLY OLD SAMPLES \\nThe predictions of the second category of theories, which we shall call short-age constant-decay theories, are not as clear-cut. There is general agreement among short-age theories that the Paleozoic and Mesozoic sediments were deposited by the Flood, and are thus contemporaneous. Some would have sediments up to the Pliocene also deposited by the Flood, while others would have the Pliocene and possibly other Cenozoic sediments be immediately post-Flood. The date of the Flood would vary from theory to theory, although usually by less than 20,000 years). In addition, there are questions about how much carbon-14 was in the earth at Creation, how much carbon-14 was being formed per year before the Flood, and how much ordinary carbon was in the biosphere at the time the Flood started.\\nWith the simplest case, we will assume that Earth was created in equilibrium with respect to carbon-14, and that the cosmic ray flux, Earth\\'s magnetic field, and distribution of nitrogen in the atmosphere before the Flood were all essentially the same as today. Then we can assume that the amount of carbon-14 in the biosphere was the same as it is today. A short-age Flood model requires that this carbon-14 would have been diluted in a pool of ordinary carbon (carbon-12 and carbon-13) vastly greater than that of today. How much greater that pool was would be based on the amount of existing fossil carbon. Certainly the carbon from all the coal in Flood strata, probably all the oil and possibly the natural gas, [4] and an unknown percentage of all the limestone would have been in the biosphere. Fossil shells should have been in the biosphere, but there could have been a reservoir effect so that they would have less carbon-14 than expected. Amorphous or crystalline calcium carbonate may or may not have been in equilibrium with the biosphere. Therefore, to find the pre-Flood pool of ordinary carbon, one would need to add all the coal, oil, and possibly natural gas reserves, and some percentage of the world deposits of limestone. The 14C/C ratio expected before the Flood would then be the present one divided by the ratio of fossil carbon to carbon in the biosphere.\\nThe best estimates I have seen for carbon in various reserves were collected by Brown (1979). More recent estimates (for example, Scharpenseel and Becker-Heidmann 1992) agree within a factor of 2. Brown\\'s estimate for carbon in the modern biosphere was 3.9×10 13 metric tons, for fossil organic carbon 6.8×10 15 metric tons, and for sedimentary carbonate 1.3×1016 metric tons. Accordingly, the pre-Flood reservoir of ordinary carbon would have been some 180-510× as much as at present. This estimate could easily be in error by a factor of 2 or so in either direction. This would affect the denominator of the 14C/C ratio and thus decrease this ratio in the pre-Flood era by some 200-500× and possibly up to 1000× compared to the modern era. Based on these considerations, my best estimate would be about 200×, but 100-400× seems reasonable.\\nThe numerator of the 14C/C ratio could also have been different before the Flood. Some of the factors that could reasonably affect the numerator are the cosmic ray flux and the amount of carbon-14 existing at the time of creation. If one assumes that at creation there was no carbon-14 in the biosphere, and that the Flood was 1656 years after creation (the shortest reasonable time), then at the time of the Flood carbon-14 would have built up in the biosphere to 18% of its equilibrium value, based on a constant production rate for carbon-14. In addition, if the magnetic field was at maximum reasonable strength, the production of carbon-14 would have been reduced by approximately 75% (Brown 1979). A stronger magnetic field would seem to be a very reasonable assumption. Finally, a vapor canopy might have reduced the production of carbon-14 by an unknown amount, although a physically stable vapor canopy would probably have had a minor effect that may be ignored for our purposes.\\nIt is not unreasonable to postulate a very low, non-equilibrium total amount of carbon-14 in the original atmosphere. This is not likely to be explained by the theory that there was no carbon-14 immediately after creation because creation was perfect. That theory would imply that there were no other radioactive isotopes immediately after creation. Other radioactive isotopes such as potassium-40 are in the biosphere now, and they were probably in the biosphere at the time of the Flood, and also at creation. However, if one assumes that Earth\\'s matter existed before creation, there is the possibility that the primeval atmosphere contained primarily water vapor and was devoid of nitrogen, in which case the production of carbon-14 from cosmic rays would be markedly reduced. So a minimal concentration of carbon-14 at creation week cannot be ruled out.\\nFinally, time since the Flood must be factored into any model for carbon-14 dating. If one follows a Masoretic chronology, there would be a reduction in the carbon-14 in pre-Flood samples of 41-42% due to the time since the Flood. For a Septuagint chronology, the reduction would be about 50%, and for gap theories the reduction would be substantially larger. Putting the Flood at the date proposed by Aardsma (1991) — 12,000 B.C. — would reduce the amount of carbon-14 by 82%. Putting it at 57,100 years ago would reduce it by 99.9%. At this point I will ignore theories that place the Flood more than about 20,000 years ago (and would reduce the concentration of carbon-14 by >91%), although it must be acknowledged that these theories cannot be logically excluded from consideration.\\nThe various factors that would reduce the pre-Flood 14C/C ratio in the biosphere are not entirely independent of each other. One can propose a Flood at 20,000 years ago, but if one expands the post-Flood chronology, then it seems illogical to assume a short chronology for the time between creation and the Flood. Increasing the time between creation and the Flood provides more time for carbon-14 to equilibrate and lessens the apparent aging effect of starting with little or no carbon-14 at creation. Thus it is not accurate to take all the reduction factors and simply multiply them together. The same is true, although to a lesser degree, for models based on the Septuagint. Finally, if one assumes that some of the carbon in the Phanerozoic fossil record came from comets or meteorites, the reduction in the pre-Flood 14C/C ratio caused by a larger pre-Flood biomass must be decreased by the proportion of \"fossil\" carbon that did not come from the earth.\\nWe will now make some estimates using the above assumptions. For example, suppose we start with a Masoretic chronology, a stronger pre-Flood magnetic field, and a negligible amount of carbon-14 at Creation. Then a reasonable first approximation for the expected measured 14C/C ratio of fossils buried in the Flood is the reduction due to biomass, multiplied by the reduction due to the magnetic field, multiplied by the reduction due to non-equilibrium conditions at the beginning, multiplied by the reduction due to the passage of time since the Flood. My best a priori estimate of the numbers would be 1/200 × 1/4 × 1/5 × 60%, or 1/6,667, which would correspond to 0.015 pmc measured. It could be as low as 1/4 of that if our estimates of fossil carbon are low and the carbon in limestone was in equilibrium with the biosphere, [5] although experimental evidence (see below) indicates that dolomite was not in equilibrium with the biosphere and suggests that most of the limestone was also not in equilibrium with the biosphere. A more likely lower limit would be 1/13,333, or 0.0075 pmc. A reasonable upper limit would be 1/100 (low estimate of reduction due to biomass) × 60%, or 0.6 pmc. Much of the spread in the upper limit is due to differences in assumptions regarding the pre-Flood magnetic field, assumptions that are presently untestable. A Septuagint chronology would predict roughly the same numbers. The decrease due to a longer time since the Flood would be almost exactly offset by an increase due to more time between creation and the Flood. The only change would be that the upper limit would drop to 0.5 pmc.\\nAncient flood models probably should not use factors for non-equilibrium conditions before the Flood. Therefore the model proposed by Aardsma (1991) should predict a most likely concentration of 1/200 × 1/4 × 18%, or 0.0225, with a lower estimate of 0.01125 (or 0.01) pmc and an upper estimate of 0.18 pmc. At 21,000 years the estimate should be roughly 0.01 pmc with a lower limit of 0.005 pmc and an upper limit of 0.08 pmc. Calculations could be made for other models, but these calculations give one a feel for the predictions that can be expected from various models. It is of interest that there is so little variation in the predictions for the lower limit for present-day measurements of pre-Flood fossil carbon among the major models.\\nCARBON-14 IS FOUND CONSISTENTLY IN GEOLOGICALLY OLD SAMPLES\\nWhen carbon-14 dating was first developed, the level of carbon-14 was measured by counting the decay of carbon-14 atoms in a given sample (decay counting). This was associated with a high background count, which, under most circumstances, swamped the low levels of carbon-14 expected by short-age constant-decay theories noted above. It also necessitated having a control counter, which would be filled with supposedly \"dead\" carbon. Any small residual amount of carbon-14 in the \"dead\" carbon would not be detected, because the method guarantees that any residual would be subtracted out. A possible exception would be if one used truly non-fossil carbon which was known to contain no residual carbon-14 for the comparison. As far as I know, such an experiment has never been reported, and it is difficult to imagine it being done by someone who did not consider short-age constant-decay theories a live option. A method called isotope enrichment might be able to find carbon-14 in fossil material even given the above difficulties. This method involved concentrating the carbon-13 and carbon-14 in a specimen by fractional distillation of carbon monoxide. The fraction of carbon-14 in a specimen is increased, making it measurable using standard decay-counting techniques. This method could theoretically detect carbon-14 in geologically old specimens, since, for example, carbon dioxide from anthracite coal can be compared with enriched carbon dioxide from anthracite coal.\\nThe experiment in question was done at least three times (Grootes et al., 1975). The first time, the results on anthracite were 0.023±0.011 pmc. Grootes et al. believed that there was contamination in the system. They made some changes in the process and repeated the experiment two more times, getting 0.0072±0.0096 pmc, and 0.0062±0.0038 pmc. If the last two results are combined statistically, they give 0.0064±0.0035 pmc, which is not statistically different from zero. This particular method has fallen out of favor. The reason for this is not documented in the literature, but probably was due at least in part to the fact that it involved a difficult, time-consuming fractional distillation followed by a time-consuming process of counting decays.\\nIn the late 1970s a new method of measuring carbon-14, called AMS, or Accelerator Mass Spectrometry dating, was developed. This involved directly counting the carbon-14 atoms, using a tandem accelerator. Since the atoms are first negatively charged, most of the interference from nitrogen-14, which is much more common than carbon-14 but does not easily take a negative charge, is eliminated. In addition, each atom is accelerated by a very high voltage, and several tests can be done to make sure that we are in fact measuring carbon-14 instead of some interfering isobar, or cosmic rays. Theoretically, the machine should have zero machine background, which makes it ideal for attempting to detect carbon-14 in geologically old specimens. [6]\\nIf one defines machine background as carbon-14 equivalent counts without a sample in place, the predictions of zero background turn out to be largely correct. Schmidt et al. (1987) were able to run their machine with an empty aluminum target holder without finding any atoms of carbon-14 in a 30-minute run, which would be equivalent to >90,000 radiocarbon years (<0.0014 pmc) if they had had a standard current of ordinary carbon. Van der Plicht et al. (1995) found an equivalent age of >100,000 radiocarbon years, and Kirner et al. (1995) obtained an equivalent age of >104,000 years.\\nCareful experimental technique is necessary. Some experiments did show small amounts of carbon-14 in the machine blanks. Donahue et al. (1984) found carbon-14 atoms equivalent to 0.08 pmc with an empty target holder. Kitagawa et al. (1993) obtained 0.03 pmc. Beukins et al. (1992) did better (0.015±0.007 pmc). Apparently with more careful technique one can reduce the machine background to negligible levels, as noted in the preceding paragraph.\\nHowever, as one can see from Table 1 (p 14-15), carbon samples have not matched the best results from machine blanks. There is some residual carbon-14 in even the most carefully prepared samples, so that the article by Schmidt et al. was entitled \"Early expectations of AMS: greater ages and tiny fractions. One failure? — one success.\" As can be seen from Table 1, further experiments have continued to find carbon-14 in supposedly \"dead\" carbon, raising the question as to how to explain this carbon-14.\\nShort-age constant-decay theories predict that fossil carbon should contain a small amount of carbon-14, and one explanation of the above data is that one of these short-age theories is correct. But there are other possible explanations. The obvious ones are machine background which only happens when carbon-12 and/or carbon-13 are in the machine, contamination of the source deposits in the ground ( in situ), contamination of the samples with modern carbon during sample processing, or the creation of carbon-14 in situ  by nuclear reactions.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMACHINE BACKGROUND IS NOT AN ADEQUATE EXPLANATION\\nThe hypothesis that machine background can account for this carbon-14 has been universally rejected by researchers in the field, and for good reason. Any atom which is counted as carbon-14 must pass at least 3, and sometimes 4 tests. First, it must pass through the accelerator. Remember that there is no difference between these experiments and those that have an empty sample holder, except the sample. So any difference between the experiments must be explained by something which goes through the accelerator. But after the accelerator there is a magnet which separates the beam by its charge-to-momentum ratio. So any ion which strikes the detector in the first place must have the charge-to-momentum ratio of carbon-14. Second, the amount of energy lost creating ions in a defined thickness of semiconductor material is measured, and only one narrow range of values is consistent with carbon-14 that has traveled through the accelerator. Third, the total energy, measured by ions created in a thickness of semiconductor thick enough to stop the carbon-14, is measured. This again results in a narrow range of acceptable values consistent with carbon-14.\\nThese three tests are enough by themselves to uniquely identify carbon-14 and to distinguish it from nitrogen-14, carbon-13 with hydrogen, carbon-12 with two hydrogens or with deuterium, two lithium-7 atoms, other molecular species, or cosmic rays. However, in some experiments, most notably Bonani et al. (1986), the time of flight of each particle between the ion stripper in the middle of the tandem accelerator and the detector was also measured, and it was also consistent with carbon-14 and not with other molecular species. Thus one can be quite sure that the atoms that are being detected are indeed carbon-14. [7]\\nNUCLEAR SYNTHESIS OF CARBON-14 IN SITU IS NOT AN ADEQUATE EXPLANATION\\nThe next explanation that might be made is that these carbon-14 atoms are created by nuclear reactions while the sample is in the ground. This is highly improbable. Zito et al. (1980) calculated that groundwater in granite could possibly have carbon with a carbon-14 concentration of 0.00266 pmc. Florkowski et al. (1988) corroborated their calculations. If one reworks the calculations using oil, one comes up with 2.7×10 -8 pmc (Giem 1997a, p 186-187). This is well below the range capable of explaining the above experiments.\\nOne can hypothesize that neutrons were once much more plentiful than they are now, and that is why there is so much carbon-14 in our experimental samples. But the number of neutrons required must be over a million times more than those found today, for at least 6,000 years; and every 5,730 years that we put the neutron shower back doubles the number of neutrons required. Every time we halve the duration of the neutron shower we roughly double its required intensity. Eventually the problem becomes insurmountable. In addition, since nitrogen-14 captures neutrons 110,000 times more easily than does carbon-13, a sample with 0.000 0091% nitrogen should have twice the carbon-14 content of a sample without any nitrogen. If neutron capture is a significant source of carbon-14 in a given sample, radiocarbon dates should vary wildly with the nitrogen content of the sample. I know of no such data. Perhaps this effect should be looked for by anyone seriously proposing that significant quantities of carbon-14 were produced by nuclear synthesis in situ.\\nCONTAMINATION IN SITU EXPLAINS SOME, BUT PROBABLY NOT ALL, THE RESULTS\\nContamination in situ is sometimes used to explain the persistent residual carbon-14 found in these experiments. Some experiments virtually demand this explanation as at least a contribution to the results obtained. For example, Schleicher et al. (1998) note that relatively untreated foraminifera gave 0.401±0.084 pmc, whereas foraminifera treated with various methods for removal of contamination gave a smaller 14C/C ratio, reaching 0.166±0.008 pmc when using a purification procedure including 30% H 2O2 and 15 min of ultrasonic treatment, and attachment to the carbonate system wet. This is highly unlikely (p<0.001) to be due to chance. However, it appears that the best data on fossil carbon with a published standard deviation, other than Beukins (1992), Kirner (1995), and Beukins (1993), all cluster at about 0.15 pmc and are not statistically different from one another (see Figure 1). It is difficult to imagine a natural process contaminating wood, whalebone, petroleum and coal, all to roughly the same extent. It is especially difficult to imagine all parts of a coal seam being contaminated equally.\\nHowever, contamination in situ is a more likely consideration than is nuclear synthesis in situ or machine error. One could evaluate the contamination hypothesis by carefully testing different samples, such as coal from different parts of a seam, and from different depths, coke, coal tar, petroleum, and wood. If all sources come out with similar amounts of carbon-14, we can be reasonably sure that contamination in situ is not a good explanation for the observed amount of carbon-14. The available data suggest this to be the case, but do not quite prove it. On the other hand, if we are consistently able to get significantly lower 14C/C ratios with some samples of pre-Pleistocene fossil carbon than with others, this suggests that the differences between the 14C/C ratios in the various samples may reasonably be explained by contamination in situ .\\n\\nCONTAMINATION DURING SAMPLE PROCESSING EXPLAINS SOME, BUT PROBABLY NOT ALL, THE RESULTS\\nContamination during sample processing is the most frequent explanation of carbon-14 in samples expected to be \"dead\" by long-age theories. There is good evidence that contamination during sample processing often occurs, and that some of the carbon-14 found in these samples may be accounted for on this basis. For example, Middleton et al. (1989) measured one dolomite sample that had 0.01 pmc when handled with extreme care, and 0.5 pmc when handled with less care. Van der Borg et al. (1997) noted graphite to have 0.04±0.02 pmc when measured without reprocessing, and 0.18 pmc when tested after recycling. Arnold et al. (1987) reported a graphite having 0.089±0.017 pmc without recycling, and 0.34±0.11 pmc after recycling (statistically significant at p<0.025). Schmidt et al. (1987) analyzed several samples of graphite that varied in 14C/C ratio depending on the care used in preparation. Perhaps most impressively, Schmidt et al. noted a finite \"age\" (0.05 pmc) for carbon-12 obtained from a Faraday cup in their AMS machine, that was functioning as a mass spectrometer to separate carbon-12 from carbon-14. Contamination during sample processing cannot be ignored. Therefore, results for coal higher than about 1 pmc, which seem to me to be likely to be due to contamination, have not been reported in this paper.\\nHowever, contamination is not necessarily inevitable. Some parts of the process do not have to add contamination when done carefully. Beukins (1992) reported anthracite (0.081±0.019), natural gas (0.077±0.005), and marble (0.076±0.009) samples that had essentially the same 14C/C ratio. Since each of these materials is processed differently, these results show that all steps in sample preparation except the reduction step can be done in such a way as to avoid contamination.\\nIt is possible that the iron sometimes used to reduce carbon dioxide to carbon is a source of contamination. In one experiment (Brown et al. 1983), this iron contained carbon with a 1.5 pmc 14C/C ratio.One of the consistent findings in these experiments is that graphite dates older (i.e., has a lower 14C/C ratio) than fossil carbon. Marble and calcite give intermediate results, at least in the best experiments. This is true not only for the overall list but also for several experiments where graphite was directly compared with fossil carbon from various sources (e.g., Schmidt et al. 1987, Aerts-Bijma et al. 1997, Grootes et al. 1986, Vogel et al. 1987). Interestingly, the lowest 14C/C ratio is for dolomite. It has been suggested that the form of the sample influences the amount of contamination. In general, the samples that have to be manipulated the most, and specifically those that require reduction from carbon dioxide to carbon, tend to have higher 14C/C ratios. The dolomite noted above may not be an exception, as it was measured directly as carbon dioxide without being reduced (one of the few experiments to try this technique).\\nHowever, it should be noted that some of the graphite samples, and perhaps most of them, come from Finland, where there is Precambrian graphite. In one such case the graphite is specified to be from the bedrock of Finland (Bonani et al. 1986). An equally good hypothesis for the difference between 14C/C ratios in graphite and coal is that Precambrian graphite was not in equilibrium with the pre-Flood biosphere and should have lower residual carbon-14 levels than fossil carbon from the Flood.\\nRESIDUAL ACTIVITY IS THE MOST LIKELY EXPLANATION FOR CARBON-14 IN PRE-PLEISTOCENE MATERIAL\\nTo summarize, there are two competing theories for the higher 14C/C ratio in fossil material compared to graphite. The first is that there is contamination from the reduction step. The second is that there is more residual carbon-14 in fossil material than there is in graphite. Differences between these theories are testable.\\nOne way to test these competing explanations is to oxidize graphite and run it through the same reduction step as the other materials. This has been done (Van der Borg et al. 1997), and the results were 0.18±0.04 pmc. This result clearly indicates contamination during the reduction process.\\nAnother way to test these explanations would be to use a method that does not require reducing the carbon dioxide from fossil carbon, but instead measures it directly. Measuring the carbon-14 in carbon dioxide directly has been done by Middleton et al. (1989), but I have not found any reports of experiments that compared carbon dioxide from fossil carbon with carbon dioxide from Precambrian or other non-fossil carbon.\\nAnother way to test these explanations is to prepare graphite directly from fossil carbon without first turning the fossil carbon into carbon dioxide. This has been done in at least five experiments. Terrasi et al. (1990) measured coke directly and obtained 0.3 pmc. Beukins et al. (1992) used calcium carbide presumably produced by heating calcium oxide with coal, made acetylene, and cracked it directly to carbon. They obtained a 14C/C ratio of 0.142±0.028 pmc. Gillespie and Hedges (1984) cracked petroleum directly. They obtained a 14C/C ratio of 0.1±0.05. And Farwell et al. (1984) cracked coal tar directly, and obtained a 14C/C ratio of 0.44. These results are compatible with the lowest data from oxidized fossil carbon, and higher than those consistently found in graphite (0.03 pmc). Finally, there are the data of Beukins (1993), which will be discussed below.\\nPerhaps the best way to test these explanations is to compare Phanerozoic graphite with Precambrian graphite. I am not sure that the graphite samples with the lowest 14C/C ratios are Precambrian, but the assumption is not an unreasonable one (Giem 1997a, p 184). There is one reported experiment that gave a Phanerozoic date for the graphite used (Nakai et al. 1984). Their results ranged from 0.06 to 0.11 pmc, compatible with the results for fossil carbon noted above, and higher than those consistently found in graphite which could be Precambrian. These data argue for residual carbon in fossil carbon (and against contamination during the reduction step).\\nHowever, none of the experiments mentioned above were done to test the differences between the various theories. Perhaps the most interesting experiment was reported by Kirner et al. (1997). Part of the background is as follows: R. E. Taylor was aware that short-age constant-decay theories predicted that there should be >0.005 pmc in fossil carbon (Giem 1997a, p 180-187). Taylor believed that he should be able to obtain 14C/C ratios lower than those commonly published, and that could possibly match or even surpass those obtained from graphite. The results his group obtained include several measurements with an average of 0.162 pmc. The lowest value they obtained was 0.056±0.004 pmc. [8] Their conclusions were that the data were best explained as the sum of a constant amount of contamination by modern carbon regardless of sample size, plus a constant proportion of carbon-14 equivalent to 0.12±0.02 pmc. The constant proportion of carbon-14 \"could arise if our wood blank was not truly 14C dead either due to a finite age or the result of the presence of residual contamination not removed by chemical treatment.\" These data argue for the theory of residual carbon-14 in fossil carbon.\\nOne explanation of the data was that it was due to contamination that was gradually getting less with time, as laboratory techniques improved. However, from the graph in Figure 2, it is difficult to detect a trend with time. [9] The lowest values for graphite, and the lowest values for coal, are not the most recent determinations.\\n\\nTwo additional results deserve special attention. Beukins (1993) reports that technical grade calcium carbide, when hydrolyzed to acetylene and cracked, produced graphite with a 14C/C ratio of 0.014±0.010 pmc. This is in contrast to his previously reported 0.142±0.028 pmc (Beukins 1990, also reported in Gurfinkel 1987). Commercial calcium carbide is usually prepared from coal and calcium oxide. If one assumes this is the case here, the 0.014 pmc value reported is possibly the lowest 14C/C ratio for fossil carbon in the literature.\\nThere is also a report of carbon monoxide prepared from methane purified from natural gas (again in Beukins 1993), which was isotopically enriched. The enrichment process apparently was done several times, and the most enriched fraction, in which carbon-14 was theoretically enriched 20,000-fold, had essentially the same 14C/C ratio (uncorrected for enrichment) as the unenriched fraction. Taken at face value, these results suggest that the natural gas had a 14C/C ratio of 0.000 000 0± (4×10 -7), and that either this particular natural gas was not fossil material (see Planetary Sciences Unit 1982), or that short-age constant-decay models are incorrect (as noted above, most reasonable short-age constant-decay models require a 14C/C ratio above 0.005 pmc).\\nAccording to one explanation of the data discussed above, all the carbon-14 found in material classified as pre-Pleistocene represents contamination. In that case one has to explain why careful researchers are commonly unable to obtain carbon with less contamination from modern carbon than 1 part in 1,000. One would be encouraged by the data of Beukins (1993), but would have to put it into perspective, especially considering the data of Kirner et al. (1997). Further experiments which might bolster this hypothesis include repeating the experiments of Beukins, using coal from deep underground with minimal opportunity for contamination, and trying isotope enrichment experiments, which may be easier to keep clean.\\nA second explanation of the data is that material classified as pre-Pleistocene Phanerozoic may contain actual residual carbon-14, and that the level of carbon-14 may be estimated by the data given by Beukins (1993). This explanation assumes that the amount of carbon-14 in coal is reliably estimated at 0.014 pmc (95% confidence limits 0.0025 to 0.044 pmc). [10] This fits with the creationist predictions noted above. It still assumes less than careful technique in most of the experiments, but not to quite the same degree as the hypothesis of complete contamination. Differentiating this hypothesis from that of complete contamination would probably require measuring very pure carbon from coal, using perhaps the method of Beukins (1993), and comparing it with carbon-12 and carbon-13 separated from any possible contamination by carbon-14 using a mass spectrometer. One would have to be meticulous in one\\'s technique, and use the largest masses possible.\\nA third explanation of the above data is that the data given by Beukins (1992) are approximately correct and that higher measured levels of carbon-14 in \"old\" carbon represent contamination. The 14C/C ratio for carbon in coal is then in the range of 0.052 to 0.12 pmc. The upper value is within the limits of error of several of the lower measurements for coal. It is also within range of the measurements on 200 Ma old graphite by Nakai et al. (1984). It fits the estimate of contamination/residual activity of Kirner et al. (1997). The only measurements lower than this on possibly fossil material are those on coal tar by Farwell et al. (1984), and calcium carbide and methane by Beukins (1993). The result obtained by Farwell et al. does not have a reported standard deviation, and so it may not be in serious conflict with this hypothesis. The data on calcium carbide by Beukins is in conflict, but should not be determinative until it is reproduced, especially considering the wide confidence limits. The major challenge to this hypothesis is the data on methane by Beukins. If this is reproducible and theoretically sound, it would indicate that a substantial proportion of natural gas has no carbon-14. However, until similar results are obtained for coal, fossil shells, or other definitively fossil material, it cannot destroy the hypothesis that fossil material has significant amounts of carbon-14. Of the hypotheses outlined above, I find this third hypothesis to present the case for explaining the data at present.\\nHypotheses which propose that there is less than a given level of carbon-14 in a given fossil material should predict that, with the proper care, we can find fossil material that measures less than that level. On the other hand, hypotheses which propose that there is a certain level of carbon-14 in a given fossil material should predict that, with the proper care, we can measure less than that level with other carbon (for example, from a mass spectrometer), and not with the fossil material in question. It will be interesting to follow the results of future experiments.\\n) may not be in error. Rather, we may be seeing a spectrum of activity. This hypothesis is also a short-age hypothesis. It has not been discussed, not so much because it cannot be correct, but because it makes no specific testable predictions. It does predict that somewhere there should be residual carbon-14 in antediluvian samples, but it does not predict that any given specimen should have a measurable percentage of carbon-14.\\nRESIDUAL ACTIVITY WOULD ELIMINATE AN AGE GREATER THAN 100,000 YEARS FOR LIFE ON EARTH\\nThe existence of truly residual carbon-14 in material that has been assigned an age greater than 300,000 years would invalidate long-age theories. As noted above, any specimen of greater age than 300,000 years should have less than 1 atom of carbon-14 per gram of carbon. If the entire earth were made of nothing but carbon-14, all but one atom would decay to nitrogen-14 in 1 million years, and that atom would have a greater than 99% chance of also decaying. In 2 million years the weight of the entire known universe in carbon-14 could decay to nitrogen. Thus if there is residual activity in material considered to be 350 million years old, or 2 million years old, or even 300,000 years old, the material in question simply is not that old. In view of our previous discussion, it is probably not even 100,000 years old.\\nIt is interesting to follow the implications of the data further. Since it is believable that most fossil carbon has roughly the same 14C/C ratio, it is reasonable to conclude that all this carbon was in the biosphere at approximately the same time. In that case, since most, if not all, fossil carbon was deposited by water, the data suggest a flood of massive proportions, and that the biblical account has to be taken seriously. If the difference between fossil carbon and Precambrian carbon is approximately 0.05 pmc, and we assume that 0.05 pmc is the true level of residual carbon-14 in pre-Flood fossil carbon, then the first simplistic approximation to the time of burial of fossil carbon is 19,000 years ago. A reasonable upper limit for the time of burial is 25,000 years ago, and with favorable assumptions regarding the pre-burial 14C/C ratio, a time of burial as recent as 4,300 years ago (the traditional Masoretic date for the Flood) is not unreasonable from these considerations alone.\\nFURTHER STUDY CAN PROVIDE MORE EVIDENCE FOR THE AGE OF LIFE ON EARTH\\nThe data we have at present, although they are most easily interpreted as against a long age for life on Earth, cannot prove a short age. Even more data cannot prove either a short or a long age. First, there are legitimate questions that can be raised about any data, present or future. Proof is elusive in science. It will always remain possible that the available data may be interpreted another way, or is inaccurate. For someone who doubts a short age for life on Earth on other empirical grounds, those doubts may outweigh the positive evidence noted above, or even outweigh further experimental evidences, although at some point the accumulated evidence regarding this phenomenon should outweigh other evidence if it is sufficiently corroborated.\\nSecond (and less legitimately), if a short (or a long) age for life on Earth is philosophically ruled out, no amount of evidence matters. The entire exercise of science then degenerates into an attempt to find evidence to support one\\'s philosophical position, and science ceases to be a search for truth. Then the above data are not allowed to teach anything, and are simply utilized for the sake of argument, or else discounted in an attempt to prevent their use by someone with an opposing view.\\nFor anyone who is seriously considering both a long age and a short age of life on Earth, the above data support the latter and argue against the former. Additional experiments may further support a short age, or change that picture. In either case further experiments can become important, as they help one make an important choice in one\\'s worldview.\\nENDNOTES\\n[1]Readers unfamiliar with carbon-14 dating may find it helpful to consult my previous article on the subject (Giem 1997b), or to consult a general introduction, such as Geyh and Schleicher 1990, p 162-180.\\n[2]It is theoretically possible to propose that life has been here for 1-4 billion years and that radioactive decay constants have not remained constant during that time. However, this position would require that one accept a timescale based on mechanistic and uniformitarian assumptions while denying those assumptions. I do not know of anyone who seriously proposes such a theory.\\n[3]The mathematics are as follows: If we call the original 14C/C ratio R0, and use a maximum R0 of 10 (compared to the \"modern\" [1850] 14C/C ratio), and if we call the half-life of carbon-14 h, and use the most accurate h (5,730 years) for our calculations, and if we express the results R in pmc, then the formula for a given sample is R = 100% × 2(-t/h) × R0= 1000% × 2(-t/5730 years) .For 100,000 years, R = 5.577×10-3 pmc. For 200,000 years, R = 3.111×10 -8 pmc, and for 300,000 years, R = 1.735×10-13 pmc. Since in a gram of ordinary carbon at \"present\" there are 5×10 12 atoms of carbon-14, in a 300,000-year-old specimen there should be 0.009 atoms of carbon-14 per gram of carbon.\\n[4]Coal is obviously largely fossil material. Natural gas may or may not be (see Planetary Sciences Unit 1982). Evidence for petroleum being of fossil origin would include optically active compounds and compounds usually derived from organisms.\\n[5]Equilibrium with the biosphere means that there is enough exchange of carbon between the biosphere and the given material that the 14C/C ratio in the given material is the same as that in the biosphere.\\n[6]Some predictions of machine background include >100,000 radiocarbon years (<0.0004 pmc) (Muller 1977), less than 1 count per run (>50,000-60,000 years) (Nelson et al. 1977), less than 1 count per day (Doucas et al. 1978), and >70,000 radiocarbon years (<0.016 pmc) (Bennett et al. 1977).\\n[7]In some experiments, only the total energy of the particles (and their position) is measured. In this case there is some overlap between the tail of the carbon-13 peak and the carbon-14 peak. In these experiments, there is more uncertainty about the background.\\n[8]The values were published in Kirner et al. (1997). The standard deviation of the smaller value is from Taylor (personal communication 2000). The standard deviation (or more precisely standard error) of the larger value varies considerably depending on whether it is calculated experimentally or from theoretical standard deviations of the measurements. I do not have enough measurements at present to give a precise value, but estimates would range from 0.001 to 0.02 pmc.\\n[9]The data from before 1979 are summarized in Giem (1997a, p 184). They are not plotted as they are all on graphite or dolomite.\\n[10]If the distribution is a Poisson distribution, the 95% confidence limits are 0.0025 to 0.044 pmc. However, if the uncertainty is largely due to overlap of carbon-14 counts with the tail of carbon-13 and/or carbon-12 counts, the 95% confidence limits should be roughly 0.0 to 0.034. This is possible. Some laboratories only test one of the properties of carbon-14 to distinguish it from carbon-13, in which case there can be some overlap between the two.\\nREFERENCES\\nAardsma GE. 1991.

El Cajon, CA: Institute for Creation Research. 118 p. Paper, $16.00.\\nWhen two individuals have distinct disagreement regarding the interpretation of significant data, it is apparent that at least one of them is in error. Age determinations based on radioisotope data are commonly considered to be in substantive agreement with geological age criteria. The massive literature survey made by John Woodmorappe demonstrates that in actuality there is often major disagreement, and that the presumed mutually supportive relationship can be demonstrated only with carefully selected data. His compilation of 494 references, mostly from recent professional geologic publications, is a major contribution to an understanding of the relationships between real time and radio- isotope ratios.\\nOne of the principal values of this book is the impressive examples in Chapter 3 of disagreement between radioisotope age and corresponding geological age assignment. The following chapters contain additional examples. The reader should keep in mind that such a list, however long, is not proof that daughter/parent isotope ratios are never time significant. The statement made on page v in the Foreward by Henry M. Morris that “the various assumptions on which radioactive dating techniques are based are all wrong” (emphasis mine) is apt to cause many potential readers who have a foundation knowledge in physics or geochemistry to lay aside the book without discovering its many significant contributions. In stating that “John Woodmorappe is very positive (and sometimes rather abrasive ...)” (p vi), Dr. Morris gently prepares the reader for a feature of the book that diminishes the quality of recognition it would receive otherwise.\\nIn his Introduction the author unfortunately makes what may be taken as a clearly false statement: “no one has performed an overall review of isotope dating” (p vii). Actually, several excellent treatments are available.[1] Evidently he intended to say “no one [from the viewpoint of biblical chronology].”\\nAnother statement that may foster an initial prejudicial attitude toward the book is located on the first page of Chapter 1: “... very little isotopic-dating work is experimental in nature.” It is unfortunate that a more appropriate wording was not used, such as: “Any radioisotope age/date is derived from a theoretical interpretation, as well as the basic experimental data.”\\nThe book fully develops the insight expressed on p 83b, “Uniformitarian geochronology is indefinitely adaptable to every conceivable possibility!”; and on p 85a, “... the uniformitarian geochronologist cannot lose, no matter what turns up.” A radioisotope age that agrees with geological expectations is readily accepted as confirmation and quantification of the designated age. Radioisotope ages that are significantly greater (or less) than conformable with geological assignment are reasonably explainable on the basis of postulated parent loss and/or daughter gain (or parent gain and/or daughter loss), as a result of solution penetration and/or heating in one or more episodes since the initial formation of the mineral.\\nThe author does not call attention to the equal capability of a biblically compatible geochronology. Radioisotope ages may be reasonably explained on the basis of either uniformitarian geology or young-earth biblical geology. The chemical and thermal modifications of isotope ratios necessary for a reasonable explanation of the data may be postulated as having occurred during an unspecified time between primordial creation of matter and creation of organic life on planet Earth, as allowed by the definition for earth given in Genesis 1:10; during, the third day of Creation Week; and during, as well as subsequent to, the Flood episode of Genesis 6-8. A choice between an “old-earth” concept and a “young-earth” concept must be made on a basis other than success in the development of a reasonable explanation for radioisotope daughter/ parent ratios.\\nWhen the physical measurement of a radioisotope half-life (disintegration rate) has a large range of uncertainty, it is only reasonable for geochronologists to use the boundary value that produces radioisotope ages most closely in accord with expectations based on geologic criteria. The relatively few cases in which the investigator has a significant option for selection of a half-life value do not justify a categorical statement such as found on p 95a: “the decay constants used in isotopic- dating systems are tainted by past and present practice which raise questions about their objectivity.” A statement such as this unfortunately raises a question concerning the objectivity of the author. We should recognize that significant results are often obtained from nonobjective research.\\nFigure 30 on p 82 presents 96 age determinations for the three U- Pb methods on 32 individual zircon grains from the same igneous rock. There is no specification as to whether these data are taken from the geochemical literature, or are hypothetical values chosen to illustrate the concepts of concordance and open-system resetting. The unlikelihood of 96 radiometric age determinations on one rock sample indicates that the data probably are fictitious. This consideration does not diminish the tutorial value of Figure 30.\\nChapter 9 contains many problems for comprehension by the readership to whom the book is directed. There is need for an explanation of what the author intends by a “lack of regional standardization of isotope dates” (p 87a). Lack of a standardized radioisotope age to represent each geologic region? Diversity rather than uniformity of the radioisotope age determinations for samples from a geologic region? The data base for Figure 33 should be specified. All published dates? What basis for selection of the dates represented? And what are “lists (D) and (H)”, and “lists (B) and (C)”? Figure 33 has little meaning if these terms are not readily understandable from the text. Why is Figure 33(a) described as log-normal, while 33(b) is represented as log-linear, and the associated text indicates log-linear?\\nAccording to the estimates presented in Chapter 9, randomly selected radioisotope ages will be in agreement within precision of measurement in 2.1% of pair selections, and 0.03% of triplet selections. These estimates indicate the significance of agreement between two or more methods of radioisotope age determination on the same sample. For their derivation to be understandable to the target readers, this section must be extensively revised and elaborated.\\nThe present (first) edition of The Mythology of Modern Dating Methods will appeal mostly to individuals who are seeking assurance for a previous commitment to a biblical young-earth viewpoint. Several features will impede due recognition by the scientific community-at- large of the significant contributions to radioisotope science that are presented in this book. In addition to the problems with Chapter 9 noted above, the myth versus reality/fact format used throughout the book will inhibit its consideration as a scientific treatise. The range of potential readers who might respond favorably would be increased by using a simple statement of topic as an introduction to each section.\\nDerogatory categorization of individuals who do not have the same viewpoint as does the author diminish the quality and effectiveness the book should have. For example: on p 96b, “Torture the data long enough, and it will say whatever you want. And if one ‘torture technique’ does not produce the desired result, try another”; and on p 35b,\\nHaving been exposed in their earlier-made blustery claims about the wonderful reliability of isotopic dating, [apologists for isotope dating] now give us a song and dance about the fact that they are the ones who have discovered the flaws in these dating methods. \\nWho else would have obtained the data necessary for more detailed understanding? It is highly important for biblical creationists to recognize that individuals who hold diverse viewpoints may be just as honest and professional in reaching their conclusions as we consider ourselves to be.\\nAt the beginning of this review it was noted that where substantive conflict exists between viewpoints/conclusions A and B, one of them must be incorrect. Woodmorappe has amply demonstrated that geologic age assignments are often in conflict with corresponding radiometric age determinations. In such cases one or the other must be incorrect. A second possibility is that both are incorrect. Woodmorappe concludes Chapter 10 with a call to disregard both fossil sequence and radioisotope age as having extended time significance (p 94b). The book of Genesis provides a basis for a third explanation which allows basic geological principles for interpretation of sequence and circumstances of fossil deposit, and also allows radioisotope data to indicate source material characteristics and circumstances for open-system modification since initial creation.\\n) of Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal (tjeditors@AnswersinGenesis.com).\\nENDNOTES \\n[1] For example: (a) Geyh MA, Schleicher H. 1990.

Six of these models are based on a creation as described in Genesis and a short age of life on earth. Differences between the models are specified, especially those that are subject to experimental testing. Such features include (1) differences between ring years and radiocarbon years in trees that should be immediately postdiluvian by creationist theories, (2) the accuracy, or lack thereof, of the dendrochronological radiocarbon calibration curve in the historical era, and (3) the possible existence of carbon-14 in antediluvian fossil material. Suggestions are offered for experimental projects that would resolve these uncertainties.\\nIn this paper I will discuss eight categories of carbon-14 models and their experimental implications. Six, or three-quarters of these, are creationist models. The purpose of this paper is to stimulate thinking and to argue for an experimental perspective.\\nCONSTRAINTS\\nAny model of carbon-14 dating must satisfy certain constraints. First, since carbon-14 dating is objective and reproducible, it cannot be ignored. One cannot simply dismiss it out of hand; there should be an explanatory model for the data. Second, it has been validated at least back to 300 B.C. by comparison with many other reliable dating methods. [1]1 Therefore, any model must account for this data, and it is not reasonable to consider carbon-14 dating completely unreliable before that point, particularly when used as a relative dating method.\\nAnother universally recognized constraint is the level of carbon-14 in geologically old material. Although the existence of a very low level of carbon-14 in ancient or antediluvian fossil material, for example Pennsylvanian coal (conventional age ~350,000,000 years) is controversial (see discussion below), it is universally agreed that the level of carbon-14 in such materials is at least very low, if not non-existent.\\nThere are five other less universally accepted constraints that determine which of the eight categories of models will be chosen:\\n\\nStrict uniformitarianism\\nThe evolutionary time scale\\nAn invariant decay constant for carbon-14\\nThe dendrochronological carbon-14 calibration curve prior to around 300 B.C.\\nThe date of the Flood, and its presumed consequences\\n\\nHow important one considers each of these constraints determines which category of model will be most appealing.\\nTHE UNIFORMITARIAN MODEL\\nThe first category we will consider is models that assume strict uniformitarianism. The model initially proposed was strictly uniformitarian (Libby 1955). This simple model is no longer supported by any worker in the field. It is of interest as an object lesson in the fallibility of strict uniformitarianism.\\nHowever, because of its mathematical simplicity, it is still used, even though it is known to represent only general trends. A simple translation can be made between model age and percentage of carbon-14. Citations of uncalibrated carbon-14 dates in the professional literature use this model by convention. It roughly approximates the evolutionary model.\\nThe uniformitarianism model assumes that the ratio of carbon-14 to ordinary carbon (the 14C/C ratio) in the atmosphere has always been constant at its present value (100 percent modern carbon, sometimes written as 100 pmc). According to this model, plants that get their carbon from the atmosphere would incorporate carbon with a constant 14C/C ratio. The carbon in animals that eat these plants might be around 2 years \"old\", which is negligible in terms of radiocarbon dating. The carbon in carnivores would be slightly \"older\" but still of negligible \"age\". A dead plant or animal, or wood produced by a plant, does not exchange carbon with the environment (if the sample is chosen with sufficient care), and the 14C/C ratio gradually decreases exponentially, with a half-life of 5568 years. One simply measures the 14C/C ratio and compares that to the present ratio, using the formulas in Table 1.\\n\\nFor those who find graphics more understandable, the graph in Figure 1 may be used. The formulas themselves are non-controversial. The graph associates every measured 14C/C ratio with an age (for example, Age B, or Ratio A).\\n\\nThis model has been supplanted because it has been demonstrated that the 14C/C ratio in the biosphere has varied during the recent past, and there is evidence that it has also varied in the more remote past. When massive amounts of carbon-14 were produced in the Northern Hemisphere by nuclear explosions in the 1950s and 1960s the 14C/C ratio in the atmosphere nearly doubled (see, for example, the data from Kaimei et al. 1992, shown in Figure 2). Since nuclear explosions in the atmosphere have been discontinued, this ratio has gradually decreased toward the ratio found before the nuclear age.\\n\\nThe 14C/C ratio in the biosphere had been slowly dropping over the 100-200 years prior to the nuclear age, apparently due to the introduction of essentially \"dead\" carbon from the use of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas, etc. See Figures 2 and 3, especially Figure 3). The 14C/C ratio of a 1945 sample from the biosphere actually is lower (and the specimen therefore \"older\") than that of a sample from 1850, or even 1700 (see Figure 3).\\n\\nOne may be tempted to say that the above variations were manmade, and that nature, if left alone, would be uniformitarian. But these are not the only documented variations in the 14C/C ratio. For example, the decrease of the 14C/C ratio between 1535 and 1615, or the increase between 1615 and 1705, has not been correlated with any causative human activity.\\nRecent, more precise measurements of the half-life of carbon-14 are closer to 5730 years than to the 5568-year half-life used in earlier calculations. So the conventional uniformitarian model would need minor modification, even if the assumption of a constant 14C/C ratio in the biosphere were correct.\\nSince the 14C/C ratio has varied in the recent past, one cannot relate measurements to the \"modern\" level without specifying which modern level. By convention, \"modern\" carbon is the 14C/C ratio that existed in 1850, before most of the industrial revolution and well before the nuclear age. Thus the carbon in our bodies has a 14C/C ratio of roughly 110-120 \"percent modern carbon\", which sounds a bit strange but makes sense once one understands the convention.\\nSince carbon-14 dating is an inaccurate measure of real time without some sort of calibration, uncalibrated carbon-14 dates are usually reported on the basis of the old (less accurate) 5568-year estimate of the half-life. As calibration is necessary, the correction for the wrong half-life can be included in the calibration. This makes it unnecessary to recalculate all the old published dates, or worry about which half-life has been used. By convention all uncalibrated carbon-14 dates are reported using the 5568-year value for the half-life. Those who use the 5730-year value are supposed to explicitly state that they are doing so.\\nTHE EVOLUTIONARY MODEL\\nThe next model we will consider, the evolutionary model, in common with all the other models except the uniformitarian model, uses a calibration curve to convert radiocarbon years to real-time years. In order to construct a calibration curve one must either have a model of how radiocarbon dates should correlate with real time, or one must have some specimens which can be securely dated by some other method and for which radiocarbon dates may be obtained. In the case of the evolutionary model, the latter is attempted.\\nThe fundamental data on which the evolutionary model is built is the dendrochronological radiocarbon calibration curve. This calibration curve is based on work in which tree rings from Irish oak specimens were matched to each other to create a master sequence (Stuiver and Pearson 1993; Pearson and Stuiver 1993; Stuiver and Becker 1993; and Pearson et al., 1993; see also Kromer and Becker 1993). There may be circular reasoning in this process, as the specimens were apparently first radiocarbon dated to give an approximate time-range estimate before detailed ring matching was attempted. [2] Specimens from defined 10-year or 20-year intervals were radiocarbon dated. A given radiocarbon date from a specimen with unknown calendar age is then matched with the radiocarbon date from one or more of these 10-year or 20-year specimens, and the real-time date for the unknown specimen is assumed to be the same as that of the specimen or specimens which it matches. The shape of the calibration curve, and uncertainties in the measurement of the unknown radiocarbon date may lead to a range of possible dates.\\nThere is a belief that multiple lines of evidence support the master Irish Oak calibration curve. However, the curve derived from German oaks (Becker 1993) is incomplete, especially at 500 B.C. (Kromer et al., 1996). Bristlecone pine calibration disagrees with the Irish oak calibration from 600-300 B.C. [3] A calibration based on varves (sedimentary layers laid down in lakes and assumed to be deposited yearly) disagreed with the Irish Oak calibration in the range of 1,000-10,000 B.C. (Tauber 1970). Radiocarbon dates on archaeologically dated material (which will be the subject of another paper) disagree with the dendrochronological calibration curve at 614-612 B.C. The present standard of the conventional scientific and historical community for the period from the present to 6,000 B.C. is the Irish oak dendrochronological calibration curve.\\nFor ages greater than the maximum age of the dendrochronological calibration curve, there is rough agreement between various investigators that the 14C/C ratio has ranged from the present value to twice the present value. While there is disagreement among various estimates, the data of Bard et al. (1990) appear to have had a stabilizing influence on the interpretation of the data.\\nCREATIONIST MODELS\\nThere are at least 6 different major groups of models from which creationists may choose. They may be grouped as follows:\\n1. Masoretic Flood, constant decay2. Masoretic Flood, variable decay3. Septuagint Flood, constant decay4. Septuagint Flood, variable decay5. Ancient Flood, constant decay6. Ancient Flood, variable decay\\nThe choice among these models hinges on the date postulated for the Flood, and the assumption of constancy, or variability, of the carbon-14 decay constant. The first row of models is based on a placement of the Flood 4,300 to 4,500 years ago, depending on the length of the sojourn of the descendants of Israel in Egypt (an interesting and potentially important point for other purposes, but one which is of minor significance here). This placement of the Flood is derived from the numbers in Genesis 11 as given in the Masoretic Text. The next row of models assumes a Flood roughly 5,500 years ago, in accordance with the numbers in Genesis 11 as given by the Septuagint. The final row places the Flood at a point usually between 10,000 to 30,000 years ago, and require major gaps in the genealogy of Genesis 11. The precise point is usually not specified by any biblical, archaeological, or geological data. The most defensible suggestion for a date for the Flood from this perspective is given by Aardsma at 12,000 B.C. (1991).\\nAll six categories of creationist models require a rapid rise of the apparent 14C/C ratio during the period immediately following the Flood, the left three explaining this by ordinary geophysical processes, and the right three by invoking a change in the radioactive decay constant of carbon-14. Both the constant decay and variable decay models make, in most cases, precisely the same predictions in terms of present-day measurements of the 14C/C ratio and their correlation with real time. If we could have measured the 14C/C ratio at a given time in the past, for example 4,000 B.P. for the Masoretic Flood models or 13,000 B.P. for some Ancient Flood models, the constant decay models predict a 14C/C ratio much lower than the evolutionary model would predict. In contrast, the variable decay models can account for an initial 14C/C ratio near, at, or even greater than that predicted by the evolutionary model. However, both models predict the same carbon-14 date for a given historical date, and so the variable decay models cannot be distinguished from the constant decay models by their predictions for carbon-14 dates for a given historical date. Where the predictions of the constant decay models and the variable decay models converge, I will use the term \"apparent 14C/C ratio\" to describe this convergence.\\nTestable Prediction #1: Discrepancy Between Tree-Ring and Radiocarbon Years\\nIt is obvious that the models based on the Masoretic Text and those based on the Septuagint require a rapid rise in the apparent 14C/C ratio immediately after the Flood. [4] Measurements of carbon-14 in presumably antediluvian fossil material consistently are less than 1% of the modern 14C/C ratio. Even if one disregards the data from the dendrochronological calibration curve before 450 B.C., it is still necessary to go from a very low or zero apparent 14C/C ratio at the time of the Flood to near the present ratio in less than 3000 years (see Figure 4). But what is not always appreciated is that the same is true for the ancient flood models. They have been designed specifically to agree with the dendrochronological calibration curve until its maximum age. In the model proposed by Aardsma, if the dendrochronological calibration curve at 11,000 years B.P. requires a 14C/C ratio approximately 110% of that at present, and if the Flood occurred at 14,000 years B.P. (12,000 B.C.), then we still have only 3,000 years to reach that level (see Figure 4). No matter how it is constructed, any reasonable creationist model must have rapidly rising apparent 14C/C ratios after the Flood.\\n\\nHerein lies the first experimentally testable difference between some creationist models and the evolutionary model for carbon-14 dating. Consider a tree that is perhaps 35,000 radiocarbon years old. It is not unreasonable to assume that since according to Genesis 8:22, \"seedtime and harvest, ... summer and winter\" were not to \"cease\"; \"while the earth remains,\" the rings on such a tree must represent a close approximation of the number of years it grew. Since by hypothesis there is a rapidly rising apparent 14C/C ratio during this period, there would be a difference in the carbon-14 dates between the inside and the outside of this tree much greater than the number of real-time years. Therefore, according to any creationist scenario, a sufficiently old tree should have a significant difference between the carbon-14 dates for the inner and outer wood much more than the difference predicted by standard evolutionary theory. For Septuagint models, the constraints are tighter than for Ancient Flood models; and for Masoretic Flood models, the constraints are even more severe. Wood that is 6,000 radiocarbon years old should have this feature for either Septuagint or Masoretic Flood models. In contrast, the predictions of most Ancient Flood models match those of the evolutionary model for specimens less than perhaps 11,000 radiocarbon years.\\nThe simpler Masoretic and Septuagint models are more easily tested than one might think. Take for example a 250-ring specimen from Mt. Mazama (the Crater Lake region in Oregon), which blew up approximately 5,700 radiocarbon years ago. If one assumes a roughly exponential rise in the apparent 14C/C ratio after the Flood, this specimen should have approximately 1,200 to 2,700 radiocarbon years\\' difference between the inside and the outside according to the Septuagint models. The exact difference depends on the rate of rise of the 14C/C ratio in the post-Flood biosphere. According to the Masoretic models, there should be approximately 2,400 to 8,400 radiocarbon years\\' difference between the inside and the outside. An evolutionary or Ancient Flood model would predict roughly 150-250 radiocarbon years\\' difference between the inside and the outside (calculations available from the author; see Table 2).\\n\\nIt is important to note that the argument is not affected whether one accounts for the rapid rise of carbon-14 dates by dilutional effects, by changing production rates, by changing decay constants, or by any combination of these and/or any other factors. The simple fact is that if you wish to get from <1 percent modern carbon (pmc) to >97 pmc, the curve must slope upwards.\\nSome may wish to claim that this may not be true for all specimens. The plot of the atmospheric 14C/C ratio versus time most likely is not completely smooth, and may even have occasional reversals. But for every part of the plot with no rise or with a reversal, the plot must have an even steeper section elsewhere. For a sufficiently long time period, say 3,000 years, the trend mathematically must be observable (see Figure 5). Each of these creationist models is falsifiable.\\n\\nSome creationist readers may resist the notion of testing our ideas. What if we are proved wrong? I would point out three significant benefits of falsifiability. First, testability places one indisputably in the field of science. Creationism can no longer be honestly disparaged as making no testable predictions. It is, or at least can be partly, scientific.\\nSecond, to what is our ultimate allegiance due? Is it not to truth? If our beliefs are not true, then why hold them? One cannot ultimately evade the thrust of this question by saying that even if all the evidence is against our beliefs, they are still true. The claim of the Judeo-Christian (and Muslim) religious tradition is that our God is the God of the Universe. If the observable universe is truly understood, and does not match some part of our religious tradition, then that part needs modification or revision.\\nThird, and most importantly, if creationists are right, and the results of the experiments corroborate our theories while falsifying those of others, we provide an opportunity for anyone who is honest in heart to see that our theories are more correct than theirs. Let me state this in the negative. If we are right, but refuse to allow our beliefs to be tested, do we not give the message to our opponents, perhaps accurately, that we really do not believe - that we actually doubt? And do we not prevent them from ever finding out that we are right? I see the present situation, not as dangerous, but as a win-win situation. If we are wrong, we will find out. And if we are right, we will provide an opportunity to anyone who is honest in heart to see it. We should do the experiments.\\nOne point to remember is that the Bible is not determinative for all knowledge. The Bible is not a good manual for automobile repair. The Bible does not even give a clear indication whether the sun moves around Earth, or vice versa. Such indication as was given seemed to the readers to be in favor of the former at the time when a major scientific dispute took place. The best Galileo could do was to argue that the Bible did not intend to address the question. It is certainly possible to read the genealogies of Genesis 11 as incomplete and not specifying the precise date of the Flood. Perhaps scientific data, including radiocarbon data, may help us determine this question.\\nAnother point that deserves emphasis is that it is simply not true that whenever the mechanistic view of nature (usually mislabeled \"science\") conflicts with religion, science always wins and religion always loses. Specific cases in point that are now generally conceded are whether the universe has a beginning; whether the geologic record gives evidence of catastrophes; and, in the field of history, whether the numbers of First and Second Kings and First and Second Chronicles are accurate. Were it not for the fact that the question strikes at the heart of the mechanistic view, the same would be the case for the origin of life. In the case of Seventh-day Adventists, the same is true for the toxicity of tobacco. Thus religion is not destined to lose every time it stands up to the current majority scientific view. This means that religion should not surrender too quickly when challenged by what appears to be science.\\nTestable Prediction #2: Errors in the Calibration Curve in the Historical Era\\nA second difference in the predictions of our models deserves mention. The Masoretic and Septuagint models require a rising 14C/C ratio during the historical era. This contrasts with the Ancient Flood and evolutionary models, and is testable in principle. The Masoretic and Septuagint models thus require the dendrochronological calibration curve to be grossly inaccurate in some portion of the historical era.\\nThe most likely location at which to find the inaccuracy in the dendrochronological calibration curve, if there is such, is in the era between 450 B.C. and 765 B.C. Variations in the dendrochronological calibration curve in this region are unexplained geophysically. The Irish Oak data are irregular, and in two places the 10-year and 20-year curves disagree. [5] The bristlecone pine data disagree with both Irish oak curves in this area, as noted above, and the German oak data have a gap here. The dendrochronological calibration curve is not supported by the extant archaeological dates.\\nThere is now direct experimental evidence that the dendrochronological calibration curve is incorrect in this region. Human bone archaeologically dated to 612 B.C. has a preliminary uncalibrated carbon-14 date of 720±30 B.C. (±1 S.D.). The probability of the date being this different by chance is p<0.001. At a later date I plan to discuss this carbon-14 date in detail. [6]\\nIt may be argued that this would be only one area where the dendrochronological calibration curve is apparently in error, and is irrelevant to the larger question of whether the curve is fundamentally in favor of a short-age creationist or an evolutionary time scale. In one sense this is true. It would only subtract around 300 years from conventionally calibrated dates, and the rest of the curve is not necessarily affected. However, once the conclusion is reached that the calibration curve is in error here, the question of further errors cannot be ignored, and it is entirely possible that the shape of a revised curve would be highly favorable to a short time scale.\\nThe dendrochronological calibration curve appears to be an example of a data set that looked good at first but had significant problems on closer inspection. I think it is one of the duties of creationists to test this calibration curve, and to expose it as erroneous if it does not pass the test. This is especially true of those who subscribe to either the Septuagint or the Masoretic Flood models.\\nTestable Prediction #3: The Existence of Carbon-14 in Very Old Fossil Material\\nFinally, there is the question of whether very old fossil material contains carbon-14. Views that allow alterations of the radiometric decay constants can account for the complete absence of carbon-14 in antediluvian or very ancient fossil material, matching evolutionary requirements. On the other hand, models that explain carbon-14 dates by ordinary geophysical processes without changing the decay constants are virtually required to predict that there is a small but now measurable amount of carbon-14 in antediluvian fossil material. This constitutes the third experimental difference in predictions between models.\\nEvidence for the existence of this small amount of carbon-14 in very old/antediluvian material will be discussed in another paper. This carbon-14 has five possible explanations. It could be machine error, contamination in situ, contamination during processing and/or measurement, nuclear synthesis in situ, or residual activity. Machine error can be largely eliminated experimentally. Nuclear synthesis can be essentially eliminated on theoretical grounds. So the carbon that is measured is apparently either contamination or true residual activity.\\nIf this carbon-14 can be firmly proven to be residual, the entire evolutionary time scale would be invalidated. To have a residual activity of 1 atom after 1 million years requires starting with a mass of pure carbon-14 over 100 times larger than the earth. [7] Thus if there is residual carbon-14 in material that is supposedly 350 million years old, it is simply not that old. Further experiments in this area should be a high priority for creationists.\\nSUMMARY\\nTo summarize, there are several testable creationist models for carbon-14 dating, which have implications for biblical interpretation and historical reconstruction. Testable areas include: 1) differences between ring years and radiocarbon years in trees that should be immediately postdiluvian by creationist theories, 2) the accuracy, or lack thereof, of the dendrochronological radiocarbon calibration curve in the historical era, and 3) the possible existence of carbon-14 in antediluvian fossil material. These models should be tested, so we may know which, if any, of them deserves our confidence.\\nENDNOTES\\n[1]The most specific examples are Dead Sea Scrolls which have reliable historical dates on them, which were dated twice (Bonani et al., 1992; Jull et al., 1995; see also Rodley 1993) with results that agree with the carbon-14 dates derived from dendrochronological calibration. Although there may be controversy over the accuracy of historical dates, and their matching with the dendrochronological calibration curve, in the era preceding 330 B.C. (see Testable Prediction #2), the accuracy of calibrated dates in the era from 330 B.C. to the present is secure.\\n[2]This is known to have happened for Bristlecone pine. See Michael and Ralph (1981).\\n[3]The difference averages over 100 years. The probability of this happening by chance is p<10-24. Even if one allows for uncertainties in the data by expanding the standard deviations of the measurements on bristlecone pine by multiplying by 1.3 and adding 20 years to the measurements, the probability is still p<10-14. See Suess (1978) for the data on bristlecone pine.\\n[4]This has been noted by, among others, Brown (1979).\\n[5]The 20-year calibration curve gives an uncalibrated radiocarbon date for 450 B.C. (±10 years) of 481±13 B.C., whereas the comparable dates from the 10-year curve, at 445 (±5) and 455 (±5) B.C., are 522±44 B.C. and 558±30 B.C. respectively. The 20-year curve gives an uncalibrated radiocarbon date for 670 (±10) B.C. of 554±13 B.C. whereas the 10-year curve gives a date for 661 B.C. of 495±25 B.C. The probability of either of these two happening is p<0.05.\\n[6]The date itself has been reported, although in much abbreviated form, in Burky et al., 1998.\\n[7]For details of the argument, see Giem (1997, p 175-188).\\nREFERENCES\\nAardsma GE. 1991.

However, we feel that a word of caution is in order. Historical theories are inherently difficult to test decisively, because one is attempting to reconstruct initial conditions, and the number of possibilities is, for practical purposes, infinite. Even if we can test a few possibilities, there may be too many variables to be able to disprove an idea completely. Furthermore, we have reservations about the power of science to test conclusively historical scenarios in which supernatural intervention is proposed. In historical science, tentativeness of conclusions is always appropriate, and more so when dealing with issues at the interface of science and Scripture. With this caveat in mind, we hope this article will indeed stimulate creationists to test their ideas wherever possible.\\n                \\n                \\n                \\n                \\n            ', 'date': '1997-06-01', 'url': 'https://www.grisda.org/origins-24050'}, {'title': 'Can Tree Rings Be Used to Calibrate Radiocarbon Dates?\\n', 'author': 'Robert H. Brown', 'doc': 'CAN TREE-RINGS BE USED TO CALIBRATE RADIOCARBON DATES?\\nbyR. H. BrownYucaipa, California\\nWHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT\\nScientists correct the raw data from radiocarbon dating determinations so as to give what they consider to be a more accurate real-time age. This is necessary because of the uncertainty about the original concentration of carbon-14, which must be assumed to calculate a radiocarbon age. In order to determine what real-time age should be associated with a radiocarbon age, the radiocarbon data are often compared to historical and tree-ring data that are considered to be more reliable indicators of time. Tree-ring data are especially important in the correction process for dates older than 1000 BC. Extensive lists of correlation between radiocarbon data and tree-ring data have been published.\\nHowever there is a problem. It appears that the tree-ring chronology that has been established to adjust the raw carbon-14 determinations is a fragile structure. Our oldest living trees appear to be less than five thousand years old. Radiocarbon corrections beyond that are often based on attempts to match the thickness variations of tree rings in old wood samples. If a similar pattern of variation in tree-ring thickness is found in two pieces of wood, the two are assumed to have grown at the same time. By comparing many pieces of wood and combining matches, tree-ring chronologies of over 11,000 years extent have been proposed for use in correcting carbon-14 dates. The reliability of the system is dependent on the correctness of the tree-ring matches, and here there is considerable uncertainty. Statistical tests show that it is easy to get significant matches of tree-ring patterns at various juxtapositions between samples of wood. More sophisticated statistical tests are being developed to correct for this problem. However, these tests were not used when the original dendrochronological correction scheme for carbon-14 dates was established. It appears that this original scheme is subject to reevaluation.\\nUsing radioactive carbon (carbon-14 C-14) to determine age is a complex process. The method is based on the slow disintegration of C-14. The less C-14 present in a sample, the older it will date. To determine a date, one must have data concerning:\\n\\nthe present content of C-14 in the specimen (determined as the ratio of isotope 14 to isotope 12 C-14/C-12, or as the number of C-14 atom transformations per second per gram of carbon),\\nthe rate at which C-14 spontaneously converts to nitrogen (N-14), and\\nthe C-14 content C-14/C-12 ratio at the beginning of the time period related to the age.\\n\\nAt the best laboratories the C-14/C-12 ratio can be determined to about one-thousandth of the value that characterizes contemporary plants and animals. The most recent determination of the spontaneous C-14 conversion rate indicates that, within an uncertainty of about ± 30 years, in 5715 years half of an initial amount of C-14 will have converted into N-14. [1] At this rate of conversion approximately 57,000 years would be required for the C-14/C-12 ratio to diminish one-thousand-fold. The initial C-14/C-12 ratio is not accessible to experimental determination, and must be assumed. Accordingly, any C-14 age is based on an assumption.\\nThe simplest calibration base for the initial C-14 is the assumption that throughout all past time accessible to C-14 dating, the C-14/C-12 ratio in the active carbon exchange system has been the same as it is at present. With this calibration base a specimen for which the C-14/C-12 ratio is 0.001 times that of corresponding contemporary material has a 57,000 year radiocarbon \"age.\" Radiocarbon ages obtained in this simple, direct way may be classified as \"radiocarbon isotope ages.\"\\nHowever, there is good evidence that the proportion of C-14 has varied over time, and a more reliable calibration base is the C-14/C-12 ratio found in artifacts that have a precise and accurate historical (calendric) age. A base established in this manner requires guessing by interpolation for C-14/C-12 ratios that fall between values that have been calibrated by historical dates. Also it is insecure for extrapolation beyond the oldest firmly established historical calibration points.\\nFor older dates the most satisfactory calibration base is the C-14/C-12 ratio of wood that has been dated by dendrochronology. [2] In temperate climates wood cells that are produced in the beginning of the growing season are larger and have thinner walls than the cells produced in the latter part of the growing season. The density difference between early and late growth produces visible features known as tree rings. Variation in the width of these rings results from year-by-year variation in the conditions favorable to growth of a particular portion of a tree.\\nBy assuming that a similar variation in the pattern of ring thickness between samples represents growth during the same period of time, the ring-width patterns of many wood specimens can be combined into a single master dendrochronological sequence that 1) has an average growth-ring width variation pattern for periods of overlapping growth, and 2) extends the time range beyond the time span of any one component. Extension of the time range is accomplished by matching an upper portion of the ring-width sequence in one specimen with the lower portion of another specimen. The Bristlecone Pine master dendrochronological sequence that has been foundational for C-14 calibration has been based on 81 living-wood and 118 dead-wood specimens from the White Mountains of California. [3] This basic pattern for dendrochronological calibration of C-14 age was set by C. W. Ferguson in 1969. [4]\\nA calibration that falls within a time span that has been established by wood specimens that have been dated by unquestioned historical records (usually by cross-referencing C-14 ages) can be relied on to give a high precision estimate of real time. But because of the uncertainty in matching a wood specimen against a master sequence only on the basis of growth-ring patterns, there is uncertainty regarding the validity of a master tree-ring sequence in a range that has been extrapolated beyond an unquestioned historical reference point.\\nThe magnitude of these uncertainties is indicated by tree-ring study of a Douglas fir log from a Mt. St. Helens pyroclast-flow deposit. [5] I am indebted to R. M. Porter for bringing this study to my attention. [6] The flow that contained this log has been dated by stratigraphy (dating of rock layers) to have occurred within the range AD 1482-1668. The log had 290 growth rings from core to bark. The age of the growth-ring immediately adjacent to the bark is designated as the \"bark date.\" Segments of 20 or more tree-rings beginning from either edge of this 290-ring sequence were compared for possible match against the Douglas fir master tree-ring sequence. [7]\\nComputer-calculated coefficients of cross-correlation statistically significant at or beyond the p=0.001 level (99.9% confidence) indicated 113 possible bark dates within the range AD 1410-2240 (projected bark dates that are beyond the present are italicized). Forty-three of these matches were within the bark-date range AD 1483-1668, 23 within the range AD 1669-1771, and 47 within the future range AD 2078-2195. Matches beyond the limits of the master chronology were made using a partial overlap with the 290-ring log. The AD 2195 date match had a 75 ring overlap with the AD 1980 end of the master-ring sequence. The lowest match, AD 1483, had an 87 ring overlap with the AD 1396 end of the master sequence.\\nMatches can be evaluated using the Student\\'s-t statistical test of probability. The 113 matches had Student\\'s-t [8] statistical values within the range from 3 to 7, the highest of which was 6.8 for an AD 1647 bark-date match. All these student\\'s-t values suggest a high statistical reliability (99.9% confidence) under the assumptions with which the matches were made. The most secure interpretation of these data indicates tree-ring matches that place bark dates near the midpoints of the six AD ranges 1493-1510, 1642-1664, 1744-1748, 1756-1772, 2078-2098, 2172-2180, for which Student\\'s-t values greater than three are clustered.\\nTo see the significance of these data, consider all the dates inverted from AD to BC, and the \"bark date\" an indication of the beginning rather than the end of a growth sequence. An investigator seeking to extend a tree-ring master chronology that had been developed to 1980 BC might get a match with the last 75 growth rings of a subfossil log containing 290 growth rings. This match could provide a high degree of statistical assurance for incorrectly extending his master chronology to 2195 BC. The investigator might not be aware of a better match possibility with a 1647 BC terminal date (extending growth period 290 years to 1357 BC).\\nAn individual who used C-14 measurements for a guide in assembling a tree-ring sequence, as is often done, would be unlikely to make a single error as great as 215 years (2195-1980), but an accumulation of smaller errors is possible. Or, an investigator with an unknown-aged piece of wood containing 290 growth rings could with a high degree of statistical justification chose any one of 66 matches (113-47) within the previously developed master growth-ring sequence, making his ultimate choice in accord with where he had expected, or wanted, the match to occur.\\nSpecial procedures have been developed to reduce such errors. By a mathematical technique for \"whitening\" a master chronology sequence, i.e., removing the effects of correlated ring-width sequences within the master sequence (repeated patterns of variation auto-correlation), Yamaguchi [9] was able to eliminate 112 incorrect matches and focus on the AD 1647 bark date. After the whitening process the cross-correlation for the AD 1647 date had a Student\\'s-t value of 5.05 (greater than 99.9% confidence level), and a correlation coefficient of 0.29. (For a correlation coefficient of 1.00 the relative width of each of the 290 rings in the log would be exactly the same as the relative width of the corresponding ring in the master chronology.) These results confirmed stratigraphic placement of the volcanic eruption that buried the log within the AD 1482-1686 time range.\\nWhitening technique was not used in the development of the Bristlecone Pine master dendrochronology that is the standard for calibrating C-14 age. Whitening technique analysis of the various dendrochronology master sequences that were published prior to 1985 indicates that the master sequence developed by Ferguson has unique auto-correlation features, and that its use is definitely questionable. [10]\\nMatching a 290 growth-ring sub-fossil log to the Pacific Northwest Douglas Fir master growth-ring sequence is an ideal tree-ring dating assignment. If cross-matching is no more certain than in this example, what confidence is justified in the extension of a master tree-ring sequence beyond the range that is constrained by unquestionable historical records, since each stage in the extension of a master chronology is a cross-matching operation? Specifically, what statistical assurance does dendrochronology provide for presuming that C-14 isotope ages relate approximately 1:1 (within 10%) with real time between 500 BC and ~10,000 BC?

BrownYucaipa, California\\nWHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT\\nThe essential agreement between C-14 age and real time over the past 3000-3500 years is readily accounted for by the equilibrium inventory of C-14 that can be expected to have been established in the Upper Biosphere within 1000-2000 years after the Genesis Flood. With continuation of the present circumstances, the Lower Biosphere (ocean below ~300 ft and associated sediment) cannot be expected to reach equilibrium status for C-14 until more than 20,000 years into the future, but there is a reasonable model for accumulation of the present total biosphere C-14 inventory within 5000 years since the flood. Tree ring calibration of C-14 age data beyond 1500 BC presents a challenge of faith for a choice between a biosphere model that accommodates the chronological data in the Bible and one that has been developed without such restriction.\\nThis article corrects deficiencies in previous treatments of C-14 dating by the author due to failure to recognize that published estimates for the formation of C-14 are usually based on the assumption that the total biosphere is in equilibrium (infinite age condition) for C-14. And it incorporates some recently published data that are significant for placing C-14 age data within a biblical time frame.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nFor over 40 years C-14 age data have been widely recognized as a major challenge to a chronological framework that accommodates the historical data in Genesis and Exodus. Much dedicated effort has been expended in the search for a biosphere model that satisfactorily incorporates both the available data concerning C-14 inventory and the chronological constraints derived from a straightforward historical-grammatical exegesis of the Bible.[1]\\nAs one who has experienced limited satisfaction and also frustration in this effort, I offer the following as an additional contribution toward a satisfactory treatment of the C-14 age problem in biblical creationism. At the outset I must express my conviction that no treatment of C-14 age can establish the validity of the historical details in the Bible. Evidence for the validity of those details must be accessible to individuals who know nothing about C-14 and the sciences involved in C-14 dating. Our goal is a scientifically acceptable explanation/interpretation of C-14 data from the perspective of the Bible record.\\nSuch explanation/interpretation must deal with three basic considerations.\\n\\nThe average agreement between C-14 age and unquestioned real time age within about ±100 years over the past 3000 years (see Figure 1).\\nThe current inventory of C-14 in the world\\'s carbon exchange system the combination of upper and lower biosphere.\\nThe dendrochronological calibration of C-14 ages extending to ~8000 years[2] (and recently extended to ~22,000 years by U-Th disequilibrium dating[4]).\\n\\n\\nFIGURE 1. Dendrochronological calibration of C-14 age. Ordinates are the number of years that must be added to a C-14 age to obtain its associated tree-ring calibrated age, as specified on the abscissa. Data from References 2 and 3. BC/AD division is at 1950 BP.\\n\\nAGREEMENT OF C-14 AGE WITH REAL-TIME AGE\\nFigure 1 is a plot of the difference between dendrochronological (tree ring) calibrated age and the corresponding C-14 age over the range between 10 BP (years before present) and 3999 BP, as given in the latest Calibration Issue of Radiocarbon. The zero reference for the BP scale is 1950 AD. Accordingly 1950 BP corresponds to 0 BC/AD. The data in Figure 1 relate to the Upper Biosphere air, soil, surface water, mixed surface layer of the ocean, plant and animal life in this region, and organic residuum which shares in an active interchange of carbon within the region. The actual variations of the C-14/C-12 ratio in the Upper Biosphere have been less than might be expected from the impression given by Figure 1. The highest and lowest points between 0 and 3000 BP represent, respectively, only +2.1% (2699 BP) and -2.5% (1420 BP) difference between the age-corrected C-14/C-12 ratio in the sample and the carbon isotope ratio standard reference. (The carbon isotope standard reference is indicated by line A in Figure 4.)\\nThe validity of the tree-ring master sequences on which the data for Figure 1 is based is controlled by the availability of material which can be C-14 dated and also has an unquestioned historical age. The time range from which such samples are available extends to the vicinity of 3500 BP (~1500 BC).[5] The essential agreement between C-14 age and real time over this time range indicates an approximately constant C-14/C-12 ratio in the reservoir from which the samples for C-14 dating have been obtained. In other words, the Upper Biosphere has been in essential equilibrium (equal C-14 input and output rates) over at least the past 3500 years.\\nC-14 enters the Upper Biosphere by diffusion and turbulence mixing from the stratosphere where it is produced by cosmic radiation.[5] Some C-14 is eliminated from the Upper Biosphere by radioactive conversion to Nitrogen-14, but most output is by transfer from the Mixed Surface Layer of the ocean to the Deep Ocean. Most of the C-14 inventory is known to be in the Deep Ocean. The mean life of C-14 atoms before conversion to N-14 is 8245 years,[6] but the mean life of C-14 atoms in the Upper Biosphere is only ~375 years. The 375-year estimate has been obtained from analysis of changes in C-14/C-12 ratios resulting from nuclear weapon tests.[7]\\nWhen some entity is introduced into a reservoir at a constant rate R, and has a mean life t in that reservoir, the quantity q of this entity at any time t after initial startup with q = 0 at t = 0 is given by the exponential equation\\nq = Q (1 - e-t/t) (1)\\nin which e is the base of the natural logarithms, and Q represents the equilibrium value of the entity represented by q. At equilibrium Q = Rt, and\\nR = Q (1/t). (2)\\nIdeally equilibrium is not attained until t becomes infinite, making the last term in Equation (1) zero. For practical consideration, q = 0.99Q when t = 4.6t. At t = 3t, q has reached 95% of its equilibrium value. These relationships are illustrated in Figure 2.\\n\\nFIGURE 2. Exponential growth of a radioisotope at constant rate of formation. Ordinates are percentage of equilibrium level. Equilibrium level Q is equal to the product of the formation rate R and the mean lifetime t. Abscissae are time as the number of mean lifetimes.\\n\\nFrom these simple considerations one can conclude that if the Upper Biosphere had a relatively insignificant C-14 concentration immediately after the flood (Genesis 6-8), with ~375 years mean residence time C-14 in the Upper Biosphere would reach 95% of equilibrium concentration by ~1125 (=3×375) years after the flood. Practically complete equilibrium would be attained in ~1725 years. Placing the flood at 5350 BP (3400 BC), according to the numerical data values in the Bible used by the New Testament church (the Septuagint),[8] essential equilibrium of C-14 in the Upper Biosphere would have been established by 1675-2275 BC. The relatively small variations in the Upper Biosphere C-14/C-12 ratio (differences in C-14 age with respect to real-time age) since 1500 BC are readily accounted for in terms of variation in the cosmic radiation shield provided by the magnetic fields of the Earth and the Sun, and in the cosmic-ray particles emitted by the Sun.[9][10]\\nThe foregoing treatment indicates that if the generation rate of C-14 by cosmic ray interaction in the stratosphere, and the mean residence time of C-14 atoms in the Upper Biosphere have been relatively constant since the flood, C-14 ages should be in close agreement with corresponding real-time age over at least the past 3000 years, as required by Consideration #1, and depicted in Figure 4C.\\nC-14 INVENTORY ACCUMULATION\\nConsideration #2 presents greater difficulty.\\nFossil organic material (petroleum, coal, wood, shells, bone) from geological horizons that reasonably must be interpreted as indicative of burial in the Genesis flood episode, and is not a component of the modern biosphere, has less than 2% of the modern concentration of C-14 in the Upper Biosphere.[11]\\nEstimates of the amounts of carbon in the various regions of the biosphere, combined with measurements of the C-14/C-12 ratio in these regions, have produced estimates of the modern C-14 inventory typically in the range between ~50,000 kg[12] and ~75,000 kg.[13] At the estimated C-14 production rates that have been published in the scientific literature, e.g., 8.0 kg/yr in a recent publication,[14] the \"observed\" C-14 inventory could not have been established by 5400 years after the flood. At 8.0 kg/yr formation rate and 8245 years mean lifetime, Equations (1) and (2) specify\\nq = 8.0 × 8245 (1 - e-5400/8245) = 65,960 × 0.48 = 31,696 kg\\nfor the biosphere, only 48% of a 66,000 kg equilibrium inventory (rounding 65,960 to 66,000).\\nIn an effort to account for the biosphere C-14 inventory, I have proposed that during the early centuries following the flood C-14 was produced much more rapidly than at present (e.g., see Reference 15). This approach may be rendered unnecessary by recognizing that the formation rates usually cited in the literature are based on the assumption that the biosphere is in C-14 equilibrium, and the additional assumption that the effective C-14 formation rate may be correctly estimated as the quotient of the present inventory value and the mean life of C-14 atoms (Equation 2). The 8.0 kg/yr production rate noted in the preceding paragraph is based on the assumption that a present inventory of 66,000 kg represents equilibrium (66,000/8245 = ~8.0).A first-order approximation model that is consistent with the biblical data and the C-14 content of fossils from burial in the flood (less than 2% of the present biosphere level) should specify that the total biosphere at present has reached only about half (48% in the example immediately above) the C-14 equilibrium level. Ninety-five percent of equilibrium level would not be reached until about 26,000 (=3×8245) years after the flood. An appropriate estimate of the C-14 formation rate for such a model should not be based on an assumption that present circumstances represent equilibrium.\\n\\nA recent geophysics and climatology group investigation of the distribution of C-14 produced by nuclear weapon tests indicates that previous estimates of the amount of C-14 in the Lower Biosphere (deep ocean and sediments) have been excessive.[7] As shown in Table 1 (row 1, columns 1 and 2) their estimate of the C-14 formation rate at 5.35 kg/yr is associated with a 44,100 kg estimate for the equilibrium inventory in the total biosphere (44,100/8245 = 5.35).\\nSignificant data that must be taken into account in the development of a model for relating C-14 age to biblical chronology are given in Table 1.\\nA good estimate for the C-14 inventory in the contemporary Upper Biosphere is 5599 kg.[16] Since the other data in Table 1 are based on estimates that might be classed as educated guesses (uncertainties as great as ~±20% are specified in the original publications), 5600 kg is a suitable figure for column 3 of Table 1, and all data in this table should be considered uncertain within at least ±20%. With the uncertainty in determining the precise time since the flood from biblical specifications, 5000 years may be used as a satisfactorily approximate specification for this time, as determined from the Septuagint text. The last column specifies the C-14 accumulation in 5000 years (45.5% of equilibrium level) at the rate given in the corresponding row of the first column.\\nColumn 4 lists Column 2 minus 5600, and column 5 minus 5600. Column 4 indicates the amount of the world inventory of C-14 that must be accounted for in the Deep Ocean and its related sediments.\\nThe data in row 4 are based on a C-14 formation rate estimate obtained from data for cosmic ray intensity and geomagnetic field strength (Reference 10, Table V; kg/yr = 3.74 × atoms/cm2/sec), and do not involve an uncertain assumption as to whether the biosphere is or is not in equilibrium for C-14. For individuals who model the biosphere on the basis of presumed equilibrium and unrestricted time, a C-14 formation rate derived from an estimate of the equilibrium inventory is as significant as one derived from estimates of factors associated with the primary production process. For a model that specifies nonequilibrium, the only suitable C-14 formation rate estimate must be based on nuclear reaction probabilities, cosmic ray intensity, and magnetic field considerations.\\nThe last row of Table 1 represents a biosphere C-14 exchange system model that incorporates the chronological limitations obtained from the Bible. It is based on the latest (1994) published estimate of the biosphere inventory (44,100 kg from Reference 7), considered as a 5000-year accumulation, rather than as an equilibrium state. (Compare row 1, column 2 with row 5, column 5.) This model requires an effective average C-14 formation rate that is within a ±20% uncertainty range of the best estimate based on cosmic ray intensity and geomagnetic field strength.\\nTaking extreme values for a ±20% uncertainty, Equations (1) and (2) with a present inventory of 1.2 × 44,100 kg (from line 5, column 5), a formation rate of 0.8 × 10.2 kg/yr (from line 4, column 1), and t = 8245 years, specify 12,734 years for buildup from a zero kg start to the postulated present inventory. With these assumptions, particularly zero initial inventory, one can place ~13,000 years as the maximum \"real time\" range that can be covered by C-14 age determinations.\\nTo close the gap between the 11.9 and 10.2 kg/yr C-14 formation rates on lines 5 and 4 of Table 1, a more complex model could allow for possible higher cosmic ray intensity and/or lower geomagnetic field strength, with associated higher C-14 production rate, within the first two millennia following the flood. This model would require a lower production rate over the last 3500 years in order to produce the C-14 accumulation associated with the 12 kg/yr average specified in row 5. An initially higher production rate is reasonable in view of the cosmogenic nuclide (particularly Beryllium-10) concentrations in ice cores from Greenland, and sediment cores from the ocean, which indicate that at the height of the Ice Age C-14 production was at least 25% higher than at present[17] (greater Be-10 concentration per unit volume of ice in a thin section of ice core), and ~20% higher at the end of the Ice Age (~10,000 BP C-14 age).[18]\\nHence at this stage in the development of a model for the C-14 exchange system a transiently higher C-14 formation rate may be postulated for the early centuries following the flood, as depicted by Line B of Figure 3. With such specification the requirement for a ~12 kg/yr average could be met with a modern formation rate closer to the 10 kg/yr estimate based on cosmic ray and geomagnetic field intensities. The initial portion of Line B represents the possibility that in order to provide greater protection of organisms from cosmic ray damage, the geomagnetic field prior to the flood was stronger than it has been over the last 3000 years. Line B of Figure 3 has been drawn only to indicate possible change, and not to designate magnitudes or rates of change.\\n\\nFIGURE 3. Biosphere Transition.

Concerning the range of uncertainty for BP date of the flood and C-14/C-12 ratio at the time of the flood, see References 8 and 11.\\n\\nLine A total biosphere carbon in Figure 3 represents the transfer of a large portion of the carbon inventory from the active exchange system to a fossil state (coal, petroleum, fossil shell and bone, e.g.) at the time of the flood. The trends depicted in Figure 3 for transition from pre-flood to modern conditions accommodate both the first and second considerations specified previously on p. 67.\\nDENDROCHRONOLOGICAL CALIBRATION OF C-14 AGE\\nMaster tree-ring sequences have been constructed for bristlecone pine in the USA, and for oak and pine in Northern Europe. When extrapolated beyond the range for which unquestioned historical records control the selection of ring overlap between wood specimens, these sequences indicate that conventional C-14 ages at ~10,000 BP are ~10% less than the corresponding real-time age as estimated by dendrochronology.[2] Recent dating of Barbados coral by both C-14 and uranium-thorium series disequilibrium techniques has extended this discrepancy to ~20% at 20,000 BP.[4] These extrapolations are represented by Line B in Figure 4. (A C-14/C-12 ratio greater than the ratio on which C-14 ages are based ratio greater than 100% represents a C-14 age less than the corresponding \"real time\" age.) Their near-universal acceptance in scholarly circles presents a major challenge to a chronological framework based on the Bible. As represented by Line B, C-14 ages beyond ~1500 BC are progressively less than the corresponding \"real-time\" age. As represented by Line C, they are progressively much greater than the corresponding \"real-time\" age.\\nThe extension from coral dating can be questioned on the basis that U-Th disequilibrium dating is based on the assumption that uranium and thorium isotope ratios in seawater have always been the same as at present.[19] Volcanism and contact with fresh exposures of mineral surfaces during the crustal breakup associated with the flood, and during continental relocation that probably occurred in early post-flood time, would be expected to temporarily modify the traces of radioisotopes in seawater. If there has been a transition to modern isotope ratios, U-Th disequilibrium \"ages\" would have an unknown relationship with real time.\\nSome biblical creationists have tried to resolve the difficulty associated with a sequence of as much as 8000 tree rings by suggesting that trees produced multiple growth rings per year over several centuries following the flood. There may have been many years in which more than one growth ring was produced at some locations, but the production of as many as 4000 false \"annual\" rings over only 1500, or at most 2000, years is not a scientifically well-founded expectation. Extensive research beyond what has been attempted so far would be required to find any support that might exist for this suggestion.\\nThe intellectual climate in which tree-ring master sequences have been constructed favored selection of the longest sequence that could be justified. The use of C-14 ages to roughly sequence a set of wood samples before \"fine tuning\" by ring matching favored development of a master ring sequence that relates C-14 age to real-time age on an approximate 1:1 basis, i.e., extension of the master dendrochronology scale to about 8000 years, rather than the limit of ~5000 years to be expected from biblical specifications. Individuals who include biblical testimony in their data base would seek wood sample growth-ring overlaps that could be justified on a sound biological basis without recourse to C-14 dating and also produced a minimal sequence. Given the subjective aspect of tree-ring sequence matching, there is a possibility that a master sequence developed from a biblical perspective would have a mathematical correlation coefficient equally good, if not better, than do the master sequences that have become the current standard for C-14 age calibration.\\nAt least until someone with adequate qualifications attempts to develop a 5000-year-limited master tree-ring sequence, the current dendrochronologic calibration of C-14 ages will be a major test of faith for individuals who adhere to straightforward historical-grammatical exegesis of the Bible. This is not blind faith, because there are C-14 data that are incongruous on the basis of Curve B in Figure 4, but have clear significance when interpreted in accord with Curve C. Examples of such data are given in References 11 and 15.\\nCONCLUDING COMMENT\\nIn full perspective there is a basis for confidence, and also room for doubt, regarding compatibility between C-14 age data and the chronological data in the Bible. For most individuals, selection between these options will be influenced by predilection, rather than a decision based merely on the weight of evidence.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\\nThe author wishes to express appreciation for the suggestions from unnamed pre-publication reviewers of this manuscript. The reader can thank them for many improvements in readability and technical clarity.\\nAPPENDIX I\\nWhile Figure 1 indicates that the C-14/C-12 ratio in the Upper Biosphere has been approximately constant over the past 3000 years, it raises questions concerning the trend for negative correction to C-14 age in the 0-200 and the 600-2400 year ranges. These trends are much greater than the minor variations due to the 11-year cyclic pattern of cosmic ray output from the Sun.\\nThe zero age reference for C-14 dating is the C-14/C-12 ratio that would be expected in the Upper Biosphere if there had been no \"contamination\" by carbon from the use of fossil fuels. Since fossil fuel (coal, petroleum, and natural gas) contains £~1% of the C-14/C-12 ratio that characterizes the modern situation, the use of fossil fuel adds to C-12 and reduces the C-14/C-12 ratio in the Upper Biosphere.\\nPlants and animals grown since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution would at their zero age have had a lower C-14/C-12 ratio than the reference C-14/C-12 ratio on which C-14 dating is based. Hence their C-14 age at present will be greater than it would have been if there had been an insignificant use of fossil fuel. This difference will be proportional to the accumulated consumption of fossil fuel,[20] as indicated by the left-most portion of Figure 1.\\nThe negative correlation trend in the 600-2400 year range correlates with long-term changes in the geomagnetic field.\\nC-14 production is inversely related to geomagnetic field intensity, since the geomagnetic field deflects the primary cosmic rays, reducing the portion that interacts with the stratosphere to form C-14. Direct measurements of the geomagnetic field intensity over the time such capability has existed indicate that there has been a steadily decreasing trend over the last 150 years. The remnant magnetism in sediments and volcanic formations indicates that over an extended period prior to 2000 BP the geomagnetic field intensity was increasing. Over the range from ~500 BP to ~3500 BP the geomagnetic intensity has been greater than it was at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.[21] A greater geomagnetic field intensity correlates with lower C-14 production, a lower C-14/C-12 ratio in the biosphere, and C-14 ages greater than would have been the case if the geomagnetic field had remained constant.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Whitelaw RL. 1993.

Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal 7(1):2-42.\\nThe depth of dust on the moon has been featured in creationist literature as scientific evidence supporting placement of the origin of the Solar System (and the entire physical universe) less than 10,000 years ago. There have been claims by creationists that most astronomers and scientists expected a deep dust layer that presumably collected over millions of years and would hazard a spacecraft landing on the moon.\\nSnelling and Rush present the results of a seven-year investigation of both creationist literature and the professional scientific literature related to accumulation of the lunar regolith (surface layer of unconsolidated material). Both authors are strongly identified with the most conservative segment of biblical creationism. Andrew Snelling holds a doctorate in geology, is employed full-time by the Creation Science Foundation, Ltd., of Australia, is the editor of Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal, and contributes to the companion publication Creation Ex Nihilo. David Rush has a master’s degree in physics, has been employed by the Institute for Creation Research, and is a public school science teacher in California. They have produced an exhaustive, thoroughly professional treatment of cosmic dust accumulation on the moon.\\nMany creationists will be disillusioned, or at least disturbed, by the technical and historical details Snelling and Rush have made readily accessible. These authors forthrightly state that\\n... the amount of meteoritic dust and meteorite debris in the lunar regolith and surface dust layer, even taking into account the postulated early [more] intense meteorite and meteoritic dust bombardment, does not contradict the evolutionists’ multi-billion year time scale (while not proving it).... creationists should not continue to use the dust on the moon as evidence against an old age for the moon and the solar system (Abstract, p 3).\\nThey further state that “creationists cannot say or imply, as some have, that most astronomers and scientists \"expected a deep dust layer” on the moon (p 30). Contrary to claims made by some creationist writers, Snelling and Rush document that “the data had already convinced most scientists before the Apollo moon landings that very little dust would be found on the moon” (p 37).\\nValid estimates of the meteoritic dust influx to the earth in tons/ year, as obtained by Snelling and Rush from the professional literature, range from 450 to 460,000. Estimates for the moon range from 4000 to 19,900. Using 10,000 tons/year as a representative estimate, Snelling and Rush note that about one billion years would be required to accumulate a 2 cm thick dust layer over the lunar surface. The Apollo astronauts reported lunar surface dust thickness ranging between 0.3 cm and 7.6 cm. So Snelling and Rush can say that “even with a meteoritic dust influx rate of 300 times the present figure, we can still comfortably account for the quantity of meteoritic dust found in the lunar regolith and the loose surface layer over the evolutionists’ timescale” (p 38). Having thoroughly considered all aspects of the topic, the authors say:\\n... it is inescapably clear that the amount of meteoritic dust on the lunar surface and in the regolith is not at all inconsistent with the present meteoritic dust influx rate to the lunar surface operating over the multi-billion year time framework proposed by evolutionists, but including a higher influx rate in the early history of the moon (p 36). \\nIt should be emphasized that there is nothing in the evidence covered by Snelling and Rush that is incompatible with biblical specifications, if the creation account is treated on the basis of the definitions given in Genesis 1:8-10. Creationism has been severely discredited by scientifically inept efforts to defend presumptions that were unjustifiably considered to be mandated by biblical testimony. The publication of “Moon Dust and the Age of the Solar System” is a major contribution to credible scientific creationism.\\n                \\n                \\n                \\n                \\n            ', 'date': '1993-01-01', 'url': 'https://www.grisda.org/origins-20043'}, {'title': 'An Age-Old Question\\n', 'author': 'Robert H.

Cloth, $49.50.\\nThere has been a long-standing need for a convenient compilation of the radiometric data from which conclusions have been drawn concerning the length of time planet Earth and other components of the Solar System have been in existence. The Age of the Earth meets this need more than adequately. The author is Research Geologist at the U.S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California, and is preeminently qualified to give a comprehensive, authoritative, and readable treatment of the topics he addresses. In his Preface he states that the book was “written for people with some modest background in science, ... [to be] useful and informative to those without a deep knowledge of geology or physics.” The book provides valuable resource material for individuals who make a professional-level witness for a creationist view-point, although the author’s analysis of data is from a purely secular, uniformitarian approach that dismisses concepts of supernatural and revelation as purely human and non-authoritative.\\nTechnical terms and concepts are explained within the text so that the treatment is understandable to the non-specialist. A 14-page glossary provides additional assistance. The treatment is well-illustrated by 15 half-tones, 14 maps, and 98 high-quality line drawings. Many readers will not be interested in the extensive mineralogical and geological detail in some sections of Dr. Dalrymple’s treatment, but the persistent reader will be well rewarded. Citations to the original supporting scientific literature are given within the text. Readers who wish to investigate any topic more deeply have 37 pages of references for these citations. Each technical chapter concludes with a summary, and the final chapter is a summary of the entire book.\\nChapter Two reviews the estimates for the age of planet Earth that were made before the radiometric era (before circa 1950), including those based on the Pentateuch. A tabulation of these estimates (Table 2.1) covers four pages.\\nThe third chapter is a tutorial on the use of the various radiometric daughter/parent pairs for data from which age estimates may be made. These estimates cover primary age, age since a metamorphism, and ages over the range between these limits. To the evidence given for the constancy of radioisotope decay rates, I can add that provided by radiohalos (Brown 1990). I recommend this chapter to anyone who is looking for a relatively quick and easy way to become familiar with the rudiments of radioisotope dating. Toward the end of the book (Chapter 7), an entire chapter is devoted to the use of lead isotope ratios as indicators of time spans.\\nIt is unfortunate that the author’s treatment of isochrons (linear sequences of a group of associated daughter/parent isotope ratios) does not explain how these sequence plots could also be interpreted as mixing diagrams, rather than a daughter isotope accumulation plot (isochron). This possibility has been used by some apologists in efforts to discredit use of radioisotope data as an indication of real time.\\nIf there is a non-uniform distribution of parent isotope among a group of related samples, a plot of daughter concentration against associated parent concentration (or more commonly, plot of the ratios of daughter and parent isotopes to a reference isotope) will be a straight line if the daughter concentration represents growth by radioactive decay of the parent. For a common time lapse the amount of daughter difference between any two samples will be proportional to the amount of parent difference, hence the term isochron (equal time). An identical plot can be produced by an incomplete mixture of material from two sources that had differing parent and/or daughter concentrations. Such a plot would be merely a mixing line that has no relationship to the time at which the mixing occurred. But the upper end of the line of data terminates at or points to the daughter/parent ratio which specifies a radioisotope age for one source, and the lower end terminates at or points to the daughter/parent ratio which specifies a radioisotope age for the other source. If the ratio of parent to excess of daughter above the amount of daughter specified by cosmic isotope abundance ratios is the same for each of these sources, an isochron interpretation assumes the daughter excess accumulated since mixing, and hence specifies time since the mixing that produced the common suite of samples. A mixing line interpretation, however, gives the age of the components of the inhomogeneous mixture, but provides no indication of the time since mixing occurred.\\nInterpretation as a mixing line is clearly indicated if the best straight-line fit to the data points intercepts the daughter isotope axis at a point significantly different from the cosmic ratio of the daughter isotope (ratio characteristic of minerals which have no indication of having been associated with the parent element). In such cases the data set limits for the radioisotope age which characterizes each component of the mixture.\\nMixing line interpretation is a valid option regardless of where the line intercepts the daughter isotope axis. In any case a mixing line interpretation provides no escape from a real time significance of radio- isotope daughter/parent ratios. Linear plots of daughter versus parent for some inhomogeneous sets of samples may be expected to represent isochron development following initial formation by mixing. Isochron development gives a counterclockwise rotation to the initial mixing line, but leaves no basis for determining how much time has elapsed since the mixing process.\\nThe Age of the Earth makes two major contributions. One is a convenient collection of radioisotope data for the lowest rocks in the geological sequence of Earth’s crust (Chapter 4), rocks from the Moon (Chapter 5), and meteorites (Chapter 6). The other major contribution is ready access to analysis of these data. Any reader will be impressed at the frequency with which the figure 4.56 billion years appears from a wide range of independent radioisotope techniques applied to a wide range of samples. How a creationist accommodates to this evidence will depend on whether he/she considers it to be a consequence of the way God has managed/maintained the Universe, or a design characteristic expressed at initial creation.\\nDalrymple makes a good case for an age of about 4.5 billion years for the material of which the earth, moon, and meteorites are composed. He evidently believes that he has thoroughly discredited special creationism. His treatment in The Age of the Earth has made it much more difficult to plausibly explain radiometric data on the basis of a creation of the entire Solar System, or the physical matter in planet Earth, within the last few thousand years. In my opinion, the defense of such a position is a losing battle.\\nHowever, the data presented by Dr. Dalrymple are not incompatible with a model which allows for most of the Solar System to have come into existence about 4.5 billion years ago, the creation of life on planet Earth within the last 10,000 years, and a subsequent reorganization of the planet’s surface by a cataclysm in which there was water burial of a vast number of organisms.\\nThe final technical treatment in the book (Chapter 8) completes age considerations with a summary of speculative models concerning the ages of stars and galaxies. Readers who follow details carefully should correct Table 8.5 on p. 388 to specify 1/137.88 for R of 235U/238U.\\nIn concluding this review, I should say that in my opinion it is both incorrect and inadequate to model the physical features of the universe on the basis of natural evolution from an unexplainable initial “Big Bang”; and that it is equally incorrect to ignore the evidence for physical process and change. The basic data and their implications as given in The Age of the Earth present no conflict with biblical testimony as long as the creation account is interpreted strictly in accord with the definitions given in Genesis 1:8-10, and if the radioisotope ages of material that encloses or overlies fossils are recognized as having no more relationship to fossil age than similar data for a modern cemetery, or a community buried by a landslide, have to the dates of the interments therein.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENT \\nAppreciation is due for the contributions of Dr. Paul Giem in the preparation of this review.\\nREFERENCE \\nBrown RH. 1990.

WebsterGeoscience Research Institute\\nRelated page |  REACTION |\\nWHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT\\nThe spontaneous decomposition of amino acids under natural circumstances does not proceed as should be expected if radiocarbon age is actually a measure of real time. This disagreement compounds the uncertainty in using amino acid isomer ratios for age determination, and also brings radiocarbon ages beyond 4000 B. P. into question. By using a radiocarbon age conversion previously published in Origins (17:56-65, 1990), the authors obtain a reasonably good correlation between amino acid isomer ratios and estimated real time. This correlation permits significant conclusions regarding environmental conditions and climatic changes to be drawn from amino acid data on land snail shells from sediments in the Negev.\\nIntroduction\\nIndividuals who accept the historical and literary evidence for the accuracy of the specifications given in the first eleven chapters of the book of Genesis are open to the possibilities for scientifically sound interpretations for the data utilized in the organic radioisotope and biochemical age-dating techniques that have been developed within the last fifty years. Radioisotope data for inorganic material that has replaced plant or animal tissue, or which is associated with the burial of organic material, can be dealt with as a characteristic of inorganic material that originated in creative activity not described in the first chapter of Genesis (Brown 1986). But radiocarbon-age data for ancient organic material must be explained within the time frame for the existence of plant and animal life on this planet. The ratio of right-handed to left-handed amino acids in ancient material must also be explained within the same constraint.\\nRadiocarbon Age\\nSome aspects of the harmonization of radiocarbon age data with biblical time constraints have been reviewed in a recent issue of Origins (Brown 1990). In that treatment a mathematical relationship is derived for converting carbon-14 (C-14) dates into real-time ages on a basis that incorporates fully established age data from secular history together with the chronological constraints in the eleventh chapter of Genesis. According to this relationship, a musk ox frozen in Alaskan muck (Stuckenrath and Mielke 1970) had a reasonable life span in the vicinity of fifty years, and perished about 4900 years ago. A one-to-one representation of real time by radiocarbon ages indicates an unreasonable life span in the range between 5000 and 9000 years and death about 17,000 years ago.\\nFurther indication of the soundness of this conversion relationship is provided by recently published amino acid data for land snail shells (Goodfriend 1991a).\\nAmino Acid Age\\nThe proteins in living organisms are made of amino acids in the left-handed (L) form of the two possible asymmetric (chiral) structures. After death these proteins progressively disintegrate, and in the disintegration process, molecules of amino acids in the right-handed (D) form are produced. As the concentration of proteins diminishes, the ratio of D to L forms of the amino acids increases, approaching an equilibrium ratio at which the rate of D to L conversions equals the rate of L to D conversions. Consequently the D/L ratio of any particular amino acid in a specimen of organic remains is related to the age (time since death) of that specimen. Dating by means of amino acid D/L ratios was reviewed in Origins 12:8-25 (Brown 1985). That review should be read as a background for the present treatment.\\nIn the conclusion of the above-cited review, it is stated that\\n... there is a dominant trend for the effective racemization [conversion between L and D forms] rate constant to decrease with putative fossil age. This relationship, together with the demonstrated survival of amino acids in fossils from the Paleozoic era, raises a question concerning the accuracy with which radioisotope age data have been used to represent the real-time history of fossils.\\nThe land snail shell data reviewed here support this conclusion and strongly indicate that C-14 ages specify real time only when interpreted in accord with constraints such as those provided by the chronological data in the Bible.\\nLand Snail Shell Amino Acid Characteristics\\nA large amount of data for D/L ratios of seven amino acids in 38 samples of land snail shells from rodent burrow middens and stream sediments in the Negev Desert of southern Israel has recently become available (Goodfriend 1991a). These data cover C-14 ages from zero to 10,400 years, and represent a major effort on the part of Dr. Goodfriend and the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure of Israel.\\nIt has been observed that amino acid D/L ratios do not relate as satisfactorily with C-14 age as they should if C-14 ages directly represent real time (Brown 1985). Goodfriend\\'s best results were obtained with D/L data plotted against the square root of C-14 age. A square-root relationship is justified by empirical results, but is not expected from basic theoretical considerations. It is described by Goodfriend as \"apparent parabolic kinetics\" (see Mitterer and Kriausakul. 1989). Since a plot of D/L against time is asymptotic to 1/1, or to 1.25/1 for the amino acids which have two carbon atom sites of asymmetry (chirality), some function other than the square root of C-14 age might be more effective in producing a satisfactory treatment of amino acid D/L ratios in ancient materials. These observations suggested our investigation of a treatment based on a biblically consistent conversion from C-14 age data to real time.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTable 1 reproduces Goodfriend\\'s data for Negev Desert land snail shells, together with the presumed real-time age BP (t) obtained from C-14 age (R) according to Equation 9 from Brown (1990).\\n(1) R = t + 8300 ln [1 - e-2.996(5000 - t)/1000]-1\\n(This equation, reproduced as No. 1 above, is based on the Flood at 5000 BP, a negligible biosphere C-14/C-12 ratio at the time of the Flood, and an upper biosphere C-14/C-12 at 4000 BP equal to 95% of the average C-14/C-12 ratio that has been characteristic over the past 3500 years.)\\nAlso given in Table 1 are the corresponding racemization/epimerization rate coefficients (k) based on simple first-order kinetics with negligible D/L ratio at t = 0. For the amino acids which have only one carbon atom site of asymmetry, the characteristic rate coefficient k for conversion from the L form to the D form (racemization) is given by\\n(2) k = {ln [ (1+D/L) / (1-D/L) ]} / 2t .\\nFor amino acids such as alloisoleucine/isoleucine which have two sites of asymmetry, the corresponding characteristic rate coefficient for conversion (epimerization) is given approximately by\\n(3) k = {ln [ (1+D/L) / (1-0.8D/L) ]} / 1.80t .\\n[The theoretical basis for these equations is discussed in Brown (1985).]\\n\\nFigure 1. Ratio of right-handed (D) to left-handed (L) residual amino acid molecules in land snail shells versus presumed real-time shell age.\\n\\n\\nFigure 2. Ratio of right-handed (D) to left-handed (L) residual amino acid molecules in land snail shells versus the square root of presumed real-time shell age.\\n\\nIn Figure 1 the D/L ratios from Table 1 are plotted against presumed real time as determined from Equation 1. In Figure 2 these ratios are plotted against the square root of the time values in Figure 1. Because of the asymptotic approach of D/L to a constant value, the data presentation in Figure 2 should follow straight lines more closely than the presentation in Figure 1, as demonstrated by Goodfriend (1991a) and Mitterer and Kriausakul (1989). Goodfriend\\'s plots are not the same as those in Figure 2, because he did not use a conversion from C-14 age to presumed real time.\\n\\nFigure 3. Amino acid racemization/epimerization coefficients versus presumed real-time snail shell age.\\n\\nTo obtain a more sensitive treatment of the factors involved, we have plotted the racemization/epimerization coefficients, rather than D/L ratios, against presumed real time in Figure 3. If t was at all points a correct representation of real time, and if both the physical and chemical environment were the same for each sample and also unchanged throughout the time range involved, the data points in Figure 3 should describe straight, horizontal lines (constant k) within the range of experimental error involved.\\n\\nFigure 4. Amino acid racemization/epimerization coefficients, normalized to unity at age 2000 years BP, versus presumed real-time snail shell age.\\n\\nThe normalized racemization/epimerization coefficient trends are represented in Figure 4. In the construction of the plot in Figure 4, the data set for each of the seven amino acids was multiplied by a normalization constant that makes the line pass through 1.0 at t = 2000 (neglecting the higher of the two values for t = 2150 Sample No. 6). The average of the normalized data for all seven amino acids at each value of t in Table 1 was then plotted to obtain Figure 5. Recognizing that due to the Standard Deviation of the C-14 measurement the experimental uncertainty is nearly ±50% for the first group of data points at t = 500, and nearly ±30% for the second group of data points at t = 730, the extent to which the ideal expected constant relationship is demonstrated over a twenty-to-one radiocarbon time range is remarkable. (The uncertainty attributable to C-14 measurement has dropped to ±15% at the third set of data points for t = 1390, and diminishes to ±4% by the end of the plots.)\\nThe uncertainty in the values for k that is attributable to uncertainties in the measurement of the D/L ratio can be estimated from the scatter of the data points about a smoothed progression line, if this scatter is greater than what would be expected from uncertainty of t in Equation (2) or (3). But particular consideration should be given to the D/L values for t = 0 reported by Dr. Goodfriend (see Table 2). Notice that the D/L ratios are greater than 0 for t = 0. These values may be representative of uncertainty in any D/L measurement, or may be an indication of error that would result from an unjustified simplistic presumption that D/L = 0 at t = 0. The corresponding uncertainties in k for t = 730 are given in Table 2, as estimated from a linear extrapolation for Equation (2) or (3) from the t = 730 point. For only two amino acids (alloisoleucine/isoleucine and glutamic acid) are these uncertainties in k as great as those due to the uncertainty in t at 730 years (30%). Therefore, t is the greater source of uncertainty. The possible significance of uncertainty due to the t = 0 values diminishes as D/L increases. (Compare alloisoleucine/isoleucine with proline and glutamic acid with methionine in Table 2.)\\n\\nFrom these considerations of the possible consequences of uncertainties in the determination of t and D/L, it is evident that the hazard of drawing unwarranted conclusions from the data patterns in Figures 1 and 2 may be minimized by avoiding any judgment that is influenced by data for t = 500 and t = 730.\\nRacemization/epimerization rates are dependent on a number of environmental factors (Brown 1985, p. 18), the most critical of which is temperature. The differences between samples No. 6, from 17 cm below ground level, and No. 7, from 78 cm below ground level, each with t = 2150, clearly indicate the influence of environmental factors. Sample No. 6 evidently had a higher effective average temperature than sample No. 7. In each case for the data from Table 1 in which a sample from less than 20 cm below ground level is followed (higher C-14 age) by a sample from greater than 75 cm depth (there are four such cases in Goodfriend 1991a), the D/L ratios decrease, indicating a lower average temperature for the most deeply buried specimens.\\n\\nFigure 5. Average of data from Figure 4, with ±95% confidence boundaries.\\n\\n\\nFigure 6. Average of data from Figure 4 with ±95% confidence boundaries, but with data for t = 500, t = 750, and the upper values for t = 2150 (samples 1, 2 and 6) omitted to make long-term trends more apparent.\\n\\nFigure 6 was obtained by omitting samples No. 1 (±50% uncertainty), No. 2 (±30% uncertainty), and No. 6 (higher storage temperature than for other samples in the t = 2150-year vicinity). This provides a better basis for judging long-term trends than does Figure 5. The 95% confidence boundaries are indicated on Figures 5 and 6. The noticeable dip at t = 4500 in Figures 5 and 6 correlates with at least four of the six samples in this region coming from depths greater than 75 cm and evidently having a lower mean storage temperature than those slightly younger or slightly older. (Two of these six samples are not specified with respect to depth, but have D/L ratios closely similar to the other four.) Any factor that influenced the long-term average temperature such as depth of burial, slope of overlying surface toward the sun, or type of vegetation cover could cause variation from the smooth plot of D/L ratio against time (constant k) that would be expected if all samples came from the same location.\\nThe trends evident in Figures 4, 5, and 6 have an enhanced significance, because each rate coefficient plotted is an average over the time between the present and the lifetime of the shell growth of the snails it represents. The racemization/epimerization rate that characterizes a sample at any time will be strongly dependent on the current temperature, and also dependent on temperature-dependent changes in the chemical bond relationships that have developed over preceding time (Kimber and Hare 1992). For a continuous trend of change, the difference between the most ancient and the recent rate coefficients would be greater than the corresponding difference between a time average and the recent value. The most likely interpretation of the trends evident in Figures 4, 5, and 6 is as an indication of three major temperature epochs. Samples with ages greater than 4200 appear to have experienced an initial warm environment that made their effective temperature greater than the effective average temperature for samples with ages in the 2800-4200 range. The 2800-4200 year range can be identified with the period of continental glaciation (Oard 1990a,b). Glaciation may have been well developed in some high latitude areas before there was a marked change of climate in southern Palestine, so these amino acid data do not provide a basis for estimating a time for the beginning of glaciation. A universal postglaciation warming trend since around 2900 BP has apparently resulted in samples with ages less than 2500 having a higher average temperature than that which characterizes samples in the 2800-4200 year age range.\\nWhile commenting on glaciation and ice ages, it is worth noting that among the snail shells treated in this study, those with C-14 age in the 5200-5800 range (real time range 4200-4650, according to the conversion used in this paper) have oxygen isotope ratios which indicate that during this time the average of the temperatures at the sources of water for the food supply was higher than it was subsequently, or previously (Goodfriend 1991b). This has been interpreted to indicate an era of differing weather patterns, during which a higher portion of the annual rainfall in the Negev came with southwest winds out of Africa.\\nThe plot in Figure 6 emphasizes the need for a conversion from C-14 age to real time. If C-14 ages are used, the right end of this plot extends to 10,400, rather than 4765, with ordinate values clustering around 0.46 instead of 1.0. It would be unreasonable for racemization/epimerization coefficients of fossil material to progressively increase with time sufficiently to produce over 10,000 years a two-fold increase in the values indicated by Equations (2) and (3). These equations are based on the assumption of a constant racemization/epimerization rate. If the rate has actually been increasing, the rate at the beginning of a time period would be less than the \"average\" given by these equations. Accordingly the rates 10,000 years ago would have to be considerably less than one-half their recent value.\\nThe slight upward trend of the 95% confidence band in Figure 6 indicates that presumed real time as given by Equation 1 is too small. Placing the date for the Flood in Equation 1 at 5350 BP, as supported by the Septuagint (see Brown 1990), rather than 5000 BP, produces the horizontal 95% confidence band that would be expected for constant racemization/epimerization rates.\\nConclusions\\nThe data treated in this discussion provide support for the following significant conclusions:\\n\\n), than when taken as directly equivalent to real time, or when interpreted according to the currently popular dendrochronological model that requires radiocarbon ages to be increasingly less than equivalent real time.\\nAmino acid racemization/epimerization coefficients have been to a first approximation essentially constant, with small variations that may be accounted for as a result of temperature differences, as expected from simple theoretical considerations.\\nBased on the trends in Figure 6, mean temperatures in the Palestine area were relatively warm for a few hundred years after the Flood, prior to the development of polar climate zones and continental glaciation; and then became cooler over a span of about 1500 years before the end of continental glaciation and the establishment of a warming trend that has continued over the past 2500 years.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\\nWe thank L.

Brown', 'doc': 'FRESH BREAD, OLD FOSSILS\\nbyR. H. Brown\\nGeoscience Research Institute\\nIntroduction\\nHomemade bread fresh out of the oven has a unique taste that for many of us is among our treasured memories. All too soon, subtle chemical changes produce markedly inferior, stale bread. The duration of choice flavor can be prolonged by keeping the bread in a refrigerator, and greatly extended by storage in a freezer. But eventually the breakdown of complex molecules converts the best bread into undesirable food. Statements such as \"Better if used before (date)\" or \"Discard (date)\" are commonly found on packages containing food or medicine.\\nOrganic Molecule Degradation\\nThe degradation of organic material is a familiar experience. Organic molecules are high energy configurations of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. These configurations may also contain nitrogen and a small proportion of other elements such as sodium, phosphorous, sulfur, potassium, calcium, and iron. The atoms in these molecules tend to reorganize into arrangements that have a lower energy, and eventually break down into water, carbon dioxide, and relatively simple compounds of carbon and the other elements. Organisms such as bacteria derive energy from the more complex organic molecules by enzymes that vastly increase the rate of breakdown (digestion).\\nAn allusion to this breakdown process may have been included in the statement \"dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return\" (Genesis 3:19). If all life (the ability to produce high energy organic molecules from simple ingredients) were to become extinct, in an ordinary chemical environment the more complex organic molecules such as DNA would eventually disappear.\\nDNA Residue in Fossils\\nThe superficial tissue of an Egyptian mummy with a carbon-14 age of 2430 years has been determined to have 20 micrograms of DNA per gram of dried tissue (Pää 1985), about 5% of the amount of DNA expected from fresh human tissue. A 95% decrease in 2430 years is represented by a 562 year half-life (reduction by 1/2 every 562 years), if the process proceeds at a uniform rate. The inner tissue of this mummy is less well preserved, and has even less than the 5% level of DNA. The DNA sequences there are more broken up than are those from the skin. These differences have been explained as due to relatively more rapid dehydration of superficial tissues in the mummification process, making the effective time for hydrolytic processes relatively shorter there than in the interior tissue (Pää 1985). In his 1985 report Pää states that \"most mummy samples are seen to be devoid of nucleic acid.\" The rate of DNA degradation is critically dependent on the chemical environment.\\nDNA at a concentration level of one microgram per gram of dried tissue has been extracted from a Ground Sloth carcass which has a 13,000 year carbon-14 age (Pää 1989). On the basis of the 562 year half-life representation for the 2430 year old Egyptian mummy, the DNA in this Ground Sloth carcass would be expected to be only about 1/100,000 of one percent of the level in a living organism, whereas in fact it is 1/10,000 of one percent. At such a relatively infinitesimal concentration level, there would still be sufficient DNA molecules to be detectable by sensitive modern techniques.\\nThe oldest DNA reported so far is from leaves in a Miocene lake deposit of northern Idaho (Golenberg et al. 1990). From laboratory estimates of hydrolysis rates, no initial DNA sequence is expected to remain intact in the natural environment much beyond 10,000 years (Sykes 1991), about 1/2000th the presumed 17-20 million year age of the leaves. Yet the DNA sequences in fossil magnolia leaves from this deposit are sufficiently preserved to permit identification and comparison with modern species of magnolia (Golenberg et al. 1990).\\nAmino Acid Residue in Fossils\\nOne does not need to be biased by chronological specifications in the Bible to have these observations regarding residual DNA produce doubt concerning the conventional geological and radiometric time scale. Similar evidence from the amino acid residue in fossil material has been treated in an earlier issue of Origins (Brown 1985). In that treatment attention was called to graptolites from a Silurian formation (presumed age in the 400-440 million years range) that contain residual amino acid, contrary to expectation based on the rates of decomposition of amino acids observed over historically defined time spans.\\nThe principal difficulties presented by the data on DNA and amino acid content in fossil material are removed when fossil deposits are treated as having been formed during, or since, a universal reformation of planet Earth\\'s surface about 5000 solar years ago, according to the data in chapters 6-11 of the book of Genesis.\\nCarbon-14 Residue in Fossils\\nThe observed upper limit in the 40,000 carbon-14 year range for supposedly infinite age (undetectable carbon-14) samples of anthracite, bone, calcite, shell, and wood is also readily explainable on the same basis (Brown 1988a, 1988b: Brown and Webster 1991).\\nSignificance of Residual DNA, Amino Acid, and Carbon-14\\nIndividuals who have confidence in the historical validity of the data/specifications in the first eleven chapters of Genesis may be widely ridiculed within the scientific community, but these individuals can offer a better scientific explanation for the DNA, amino acid, and carbon-14 data on ancient and fossil organic material than can be constructed in accordance with the prevailing dogma concerning the history of planet Earth. There is an increasingly broad basis for confidence that a correct interpretation of the first eleven chapters of Genesis and of the data from investigations in natural science will be mutually supportive.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\\nIn the preparation of this treatment, I have been deeply indebted to Charles Slattery for clarification of biochemical concepts and for suitable wording with which to present them. Without his assistance I could not have developed an appropriate presentation. But I assume full responsibility for any defect in this treatment.\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nBrown, R. H. 1985.

This relationship is developed for convenient adaptation to varied interpretations of the biblical time constraint specifications, and is presented by an equation of exponential terms, a tabulation of useful data points, and a graph.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAmong individuals who have a concern regarding the validity of the historical and chronological data in the book of Genesis, there has been a desire for a reliable conversion between radiocarbon age and real-time age that extends over the full range of biblical specifications. Such a conversion would be an aid in the formulation and testing of models for earth history. The object of this treatment is to summarize the constraints to such a conversion that are provided by data in the biblical text and by C-14 age data, and incorporate these constraints into a compatible mathematical relationship.\\nThe era with which this treatment is primarily concerned dates from the beginning of the refashioning of Earth\\'s geology, geography, climate, and ecology that resulted from the universal catastrophe described in the seventh and eighth chapters of the book of Genesis the Flood.\\nBIBLICAL CONSTRAINTS\\nAccording to the text of the Bible that was the universal standard among Christians for the first six centuries, the Flood occurred 5352 years BP (Brown 1990). (BP refers to years before AD 1950, the zero reference time for C-14 age.) Since the Authorized Version (King James) of AD 1611 Western European Christianity has favored a biblical text according to which the Flood may be dated at 4472 BP (Shea 1979). For a treatment that encompasses both of these traditions I can take as the biblical specification for the date of the Flood the approximation 5000±500 BP (a simplification of the straightforward 4950±450).\\nSome interpreters contend that the dates for the Flood given in the preceding paragraph should be reduced by 215 years. This view is based on the presumption that the Apostle Paul\\'s statement in Galatians 3:17 overrides the testimony of Moses. Considering two statements made relatively close to an event, and speaking directly to that event (Genesis 15:13 and Exodus 12:40, 41; also quoted in Acts 7:6), to be more definitive than a passing allusion made fifteen hundred years later, I conclude that the Hebrew nation lived in Egypt for 430 years prior to the Exodus, not merely 215 years as may be inferred from Galatians 3:17. This view places Galatians 3:17 in the category specified in 2 Peter 3:16.\\nI prefer to place the Flood at 5350 BP, rather than the 5000 BP which I will use in the following mathematical treatment. This preference is based on the evidence that the chronological data in the fifth and eleventh chapters of Genesis as given in the scripture used by the early Christian church (the LXX) are much closer to the values specified by Moses than are those in the Masoretic text (MT) of the ninth century AD. As a set of numbers related to human genealogy, those given in the LXX are much more reasonable and internally consistent than those in the MT. The MT data in Genesis 11 are more difficult to fit into a reasonable treatment of historical data, ethnographic considerations, or C-14 data. There is substantial evidence that a source for the MT gave numbers in the fifth and eleventh chapters of Genesis that had been systematically reduced from the values in the primary source (Zurcher 1959).\\nWhat motivation could there have been for such reduction? The millennial concepts that were held among both Jews and Christians at the beginning of the Christian era (Fox 1986, pp. 265-267; Taylor 1855) (i.e., belief that the coming of the Messiah would occur before or at the conclusion of six millennia following creation, with a seventh millennium of universal idealistic conditions) would give determined opponents to designation of Jesus of Nazareth as the Messiah strong motivation for removal of evidence that they were nearing the close of the sixth millennium since Creation. This objective is accomplished by the difference between the MT and the LXX of about 1500 years for the time since Creation Week. Anyone who wishes to investigate this consideration more fully should consult Zurcher\\'s treatment (Zurcher 1959). On page 42 of his monograph he says: \"For about fourteen centuries, almost all the theologians thought there had been a subtraction made by the Jews of Palestine ...\"\\nCARBON-14 CONSTRAINTS\\nAgreement of C-14 age with real-time historical age can readily be established as far back as the middle of the second millennium BC (3500 BP) (Libby 1955). Correlation beyond 4000 BP must be based on models that involve assumptions, due to lack of objects that can be precisely dated from historical records. The most successful model has been the Bristlecone Pine dendrochronology developed by C. W. Ferguson (1968). Dr. Ferguson arranged specimens of dead Bristlecone Pine wood from the White Mountains in California into an approximate sequence according to their C-14 age, and then \"fine tuned\" this sequence by growth-ring matching. His correlation between dendrochronology and C-14 age won reluctant acceptance from anthropologists, Quaternary geologists, and other scientists whose models had required much greater ages than were given by C-14 (Gladwin 1976, Lee 1981). The latest refinements to the dendrochronologic age versus C-14 age relationship are given by Stuiver et al. (1991). According to the dendrochronologic model there was an increasing C-14 concentration in the biosphere with increasing age beyond 3000 BP (C-14 age increasingly less than the corresponding real-time age).\\nDue to its characteristic complacent growth ring patterns, Bristlecone Pine wood from the White Mountains is not well suited for the development of a dendrochronology standard. This difficulty was emphasized by Dr. Ferguson in a letter to Herbert Sorensen, dated 3 March 1970, by the statement: \"I am often unable to date specimens with one or two thousand rings against a 7500-year master chronology, even with a \\'ball-park\\' placement provided by a radiocarbon date.\" (Sorensen 1975). There is need for a demonstration as to whether an equally good, if not better, master growth-ring sequence can be established with Bristlecone Pine specimens preliminarily arranged in a sequence of real-time age such as would be obtained from the correlation relationship developed in this paper.\\nThe retrograde increase in biosphere C-14/C-12 ratio between 3500 BP and 7000 BP required by the Ferguson Bristlecone Pine dendrochronology reaches about 10% over the present value. A further increase up to about 50% going back to 20,000 BP has been proposed on the basis of recent dating of corals by both the uranium-thorium (U-Th) method and the C-14 method (Bard et al. 1990). In my judgment, a correlation of real time with U-Th age has even greater uncertainty than with C-14 age.\\nThere is increasing evidence that organic specimens which can be established confidently as fossils of material that was involved in the Flood (e.g., coal) have C-14 ages in the 40,000 year range (Brown 1988b). This constraint, together with placement of the Flood at about 5000 years BP, specifies that at the beginning of the Flood the biosphere had no more than about 1/100 of the C-14/C-12 ratio that has characterized it over the past 3500 years. (A 1/100 ratio corresponds to a C-14 age slightly greater than 38,000. An added 5000 years of real time would give such material a present C-14 age of 43,000.)\\nA MODEL FOR CORRELATING C-14 AGE WITH THE BIBLICAL TIME SCALE\\nWith the preceding background on constraints provided by the chronological data in the Bible and by C-14 data, we can now proceed to the task of correlating these constraints. The correlation developed will be an interpretation, and should be based only on fundamental data, not on other interpretations such as the Bristlecone Pine dendrochronology model or the U-Th age model. It is to be compared with these other interpretations, but to be kept distinct from them.For the major readjustment period following the Flood we can presume that radiocarbon levels in the atmosphere may be represented by Equation 1:\\nA = A1 (1 - e-at).\\nIn Equation 1, A represents C-14 level, either as the ratio of C-14 to C-12, or as C-14 spontaneous transformations per unit of time per unit mass of carbon; A1 represents the equilibrium level of A; e is the base of the natural logarithms 2.718... ; a is a parameter which is related to the rate at which A re-approaches equilibrium after a disturbance from its equilibrium value A1; and t is real time measured from zero at the end of the Flood. The value of A for plant tissue will be essentially the same as for the CO2 in the air from which it obtained its carbon. In animal tissue A will represent the average for the food supply which furnished the carbon in that tissue.\\nThe large amount of organic material, and probably some of the carbonate sediment, buried during the Flood and now existing only as fossil material indicates that prior to the Flood the world inventory of C-14 was associated with a much larger amount of C-12 than has been the case since the Flood. This is in agreement with the evidence that A for this material was about or less than 1/100 of the present value (equal to or less than 0.01A1). For simplification, Equation 1 treats A as having zero value at the end of the Flood. To obtain a significant comparison in the time immediately following the Flood a constant in the vicinity of 0.005, and within a range of uncertainty that might extend to 0.01, should be added to the exponent at.\\nThe parameter a in Equation 1 is determined by the rate at which CO2 is taken out of the atmosphere by the reestablishment of vegetation over the Earth\\'s surface after the Flood, and by the cooling of the oceans associated with glaciation and the development of frigid climate zones. (The solubility of CO2 in water increases with a lowering of temperature.) An effective change in the parameter a would be produced also by a change in the rate of formation of C-14 by interaction of cosmic rays with nitrogen in the upper atmosphere. The proportion of the cosmic rays from outer space to interact with Earth\\'s atmosphere and produce C-14 is determined by the strength of the geomagnetic field. Fluctuations in the geomagnetic field are to be expected during stabilization following the crustal disruption associated with the Flood. A decrease in the geomagnetic field (increasing the production of C-14), or a lowering of the ocean surface temperature (reducing the amount of atmospheric CO2), would contribute to an increase in the value of a.\\nEquation 1 is based on the assumption that the combined effect of all the factors influencing the rate at which the level of C-14 in the atmosphere changed from its pre-Flood value to its post-Flood equilibrium value can be satisfactorily represented by a first-order exponential function with a single exponential constant. To the extent to which this assumption is inadequate and there has been fluctuation of A about a smooth simple exponential trend toward an equilibrium value, there will be uncertainty in a real-time age equivalent based on Equation 1.\\nThe relationship in Equation 1 will be easier to work with if time is measured from the present, rather than from the beginning of the post-Flood era. This is accomplished by setting t = (F-T), with F equal to a biblically based BP date for the Flood, and T representing real time BP, as in Equation 2:\\nA = A1 [1 - e-a(F-T)].\\nTo evaluate the parameter a in Equation 2 we can presume A was equal to or better than 0.9 A1 at T equal to 4000, since C-14 ages based on interaction with the atmosphere have a better than 95% agreement with real-time historical age over the range of T from zero to 3500. To obtain a trial value for a we can set\\n0.95 A1 = A1 [1 - e-a(F - T)]\\nat T = 4000, which gives\\ne-a(F-4000) = 0.05,\\nor\\ne+a(F-4000) = 20;\\nfrom which\\na = 2.996/(F-4000).\\nWith this value for a, the activity at T years BP as given by Equation 2 becomes (3):\\nA = A1 [1 - e-2.996(F-T) / (F-4000)].\\nSince we are not making observations at time T, but at the present (T = 0), we need an expression for the activity now (zero BP), An, of a specimen that had activity A at T years BP. After T years ago the C-14 activity will have decreased exponentially at the rate given by the mean life of a C-14 atom. For simplification we can use 8300 years for the mean radiocarbon life, since this value differs by less than ½ of 1% from the correct value 8267 (half-life 5730 years divided by the natural logarithm of 2). Accordingly An = A e-T/8300, with A given by Equation 3. Equation 4 is:\\nAn = A1 [1 - e-2.996(F-T) / (F-4000)] e-T/8300.\\nThe activity now, An, is interpreted to indicate a C-14 age R by the relationship (5):\\nAn = Al e-R/8300.\\nCombination of Equations 4 and 5 gives Equation 6, a relationship between T and R for a specified F:\\ne-R/8300 = e-T/8300 [1 - e-2.996(F-T) / (F- 4000)].\\nEquation 6 is not useful for values of T within about ten years of a value for F, or values of R greater than about 35,000 years, because A has been inaccurately assumed to be zero for T = F.\\nQUANTITATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN BIBLICAL MODEL REAL-TIME AND C-14 AGE\\nFor a treatment that is a median between various views of biblical chronology we can use 5000 years for F (I have already given my reasons for preferring 5350 years to be the \"correct\" value) to obtain Equation 7:\\ne-R/8300 = e-T/8300 [1 - e-2.996(5000-T)/1000].\\nFor the calculation of relations between R and T Equation 7 may be reduced to either Equation 8 or Equation 9.\\n(8) e-R/8300 = e-T/8300 - (3.121×10-7) e+2.876T/1000(9) R = T + 8300 ln [1 - e-2.996(5000-T)/1000]-1\\n(ln designates \"the natural logarithm of\".)\\nThe relationship between R and T for representative values of R is outlined in Table 1. A graphical representation of these data for F = 5000 is given in Figure 1.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTABLE 1.

Because the buildup of C-14 in the biosphere from less than 1/100 to the full zero BP reference standard level over the time between the Flood and about 3500 BP probably did not proceed with monotonous uniformity, some anomalies are to be expected in real-time ages derived from C-14 ages by means of a mathematical model for such correlation. Since the buildup of C-14 from levels associated with C-14 ages in the mid-40,000 years range to levels associated with a C-14 age of about 35,000 years evidently occurred over only a few years of real time, correlation with real-time for C-14 ages greater than 35,000 is highly uncertain. For C-14 ages in the range between 4000 and 30,000 years the associated real-time age probably may be significantly placed within a range of less than ±100 years.\\nIt is the hope of the author that this treatment will contribute to confidence in the biblical chronological data, and increase the effectiveness with which that data may be utilized in scientific research.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nAppreciation is due Harold G.

NY: Springer-Verlag. 503 p. Cloth, $69.00.\\nThis book fills a long-felt need for a comprehensive and authoritative summary of all physical and chemical techniques for quantitative determination of age. In their Introduction (p 1), the authors state: “This book is meant to be both a textbook and a reference book of all methods of physical and chemical age determination.” In the preface (p vi), the reader is informed that the book “is addressed to everyone interested in the application of physical and chemical dating methods to the geosciences and archaeology. It should be especially valuable as a concise but comprehensive reference for students and practitioners using these methods.”\\nFor each technique the reader is given an explanation of the scientific principles involved, the materials and time range for which the technique is best adapted, key literature references concerning the technique and its application, and illustrative examples of its use. The literature references take up 64 pages of fine print. The text is written so that readers who do not intend to set up or operate a dating laboratory can skip over the Sample Treatment and Measurement Techniques section of each discussion.\\nThe book treats a total of 56 distinct techniques for absolute-time-interval determination based on fundamental processes which characterize elementary matter. Consideration is given to an additional 15 techniques which are based on chemical reaction rates and cycles resulting from global events. A fold-out at the end of the book lists these 71 techniques, together with summary statements concerning the materials to which they are adapted, the time range of their application, and their suitability rank.\\nAgainst a background of implicit general confidence in the prevailing long-age models for the history of the universe, the Solar System, and planet Earth, the authors endeavor to take a critical approach to the evaluation of each technique they discuss. In their Preface (p vi) they state:\\nIt is...becoming increasingly difficult to assess the meaning of the data obtained; for example, the question may arise whether the determined age is the age of formation, early or late diagenesis, or some stage of metamorphosis. Moreover, different components of a sample may yield different kinds of ages, depending on the method applied....The information provided by the absolute dates alone is not sufficient to make chronological sense. This information must be supplemented by [additional consideration before a reasonable interpretation can be developed]. \\nAn illustration is provided (p 6) by “U/Th dates for speleothem that are less than l0ka [and] often prove to be too large by many thousands of years without any indication...that such is the case.”\\nFrom the viewpoint of most readers of Origins, the authors’ repeated emphasis on need for age data to be interpreted by an experienced geochronologist (p 7, 22, e.g.) may be taken to indicate that in some cases valid interpretation(s) other than that which is currently in fashion may be possible. In Chapter 4 (“Treatment and Interpretation of the Raw Data”) they state:\\n... each radiometric ‘age’ is never more than an analytically determined parameter (date) which can provide information about the time of a specific geological event only when all known geological, petrographic, and geochemical aspects are included in the interpretation. It must also be kept in mind that not all of the possible effects of the geological processes on the various dating methods can be completely understood or even recognized (p 12).\\nIn Chapter 6, which treats radiometric dating methods and extends over 263 pages, it is pointed out (p 55) that if a sample has been isolated (i.e., has been a closed system) its K-Ar “age” may designate initial crystallization, cooling, sedimentation, or diagenesis (changes in a sediment after initial deposition), and that this “age” may be unrealistically low because of greater argon diffusion than expected at low temperatures (even several orders of magnitude faster), or excessively high because radiogenic argon that previously accumulated in the material (by either diffusion or in-situ radioactivity) was not driven out before recooling (p 62).\\nIn 35 pages of discussion on techniques that utilize a measurement of radiogenic lead, seven techniques are treated. Designating by “t(isotope ratio)” the radiometric time (age) determined from a particular isotope ratio measurement, the usual pattern from measurement of a specific specimen is t(207Pb/206Pb) > t(207Pb/235U) > t(206Pb/238U) > t(208Pb/232Th). This discordance implies either secondary Pb loss or gain in U and Th (p 117). In many cases the discordant data can be interpreted satisfactorily in terms of an initial formation time (age) t0 and a subsequent modification event at t1.\\nThe reader of this review must not get an impression that radioisotope ages are characteristically discordant and of questionable interpretation. The frequency with which different isotope systems yield equivalent ages for a specimen is impressive. Examples include: the 3.59 Ga (giga or 109 year) age for the Amitsoq Gneiss of Greenland, according to Lu/Hf, Rb/Sr, and U/Pb isotope ratios (p 110), and the 2.72 Ga age for the Archean komatite flows in Ontario according to Re/Os, Sm/Nd, and Pb/Pb isotope ratios (p 113).\\nThe 15 pages of discussion in Chapter 6 on the dating of meteorites and lunar rocks provide convenient access to the uniformitarian concepts concerning the history of elementary matter in the Solar System and the Milky Way Galaxy. A particularly significant observation treated in this section is that “Nearly all meteorites have been found to have a solidification age within the narrow limits of 4.57±0.03 Ga” (p 307; see also p 86 and 144), according to Rb/Sr, Re/Os, Sm/Nd, 207Pb/206Pb, U/Pb, Th/Pb, and fission-track dating methods.\\nIn their discussions of dating techniques based on recovery from disequilibrium, on the effects of radioactive transformation, on chemical processes, and utilizing paleomagnetism, the authors are thorough in pointing out the large uncertainties involved (p 253-371).\\nThe text is notably free of typographical and grammatical errors. Most of those encountered are spelling errors due to loss of one letter in the typesetting process. The English translation is generally excellent, but there are a few difficult sentences which betray the problems of translation.\\nOn p 125 the text incorrectly uses Ma (million years) for numbers which specify Ga (giga or billion years), or incorrectly uses a decimal point when specifying ages in Ma.\\nIn the discussion on correction of Carbon-14 ages for contamination, Equation 6.62 on p 174 appears to be incorrect (wrong sign on one term?), but the associated Figure 6.55 is evidently correct.\\nMost readers of Origins approach a consideration of physical and chemical age dating with a concern regarding the relationship between the results obtained and the chronological data given in the Bible. In my judgment the raw physical data obtained from our observations of the physical operation of the universe should be considered as revelations of the deity, and should be considered together with the specifications conveyed in the inspired writings of the Bible. The challenge is to find interpretive models that do not violate either sound basic scientific principles or sound principles of exegesis. Each source of information should illuminate the other. Scientists who are acquainted with the data treated in this book should not be expected to listen to a treatment of biblical material that does otherwise. For example, the 87Sr/86Sr data from marine carbonates discussed on p 93 could indicate volcanic activity during the global upheaval referenced in Genesis 7 and 8, with activity building up to the end of the “Jurassic,” and declining sharply during the “Cretaceous” and into the early post-upheaval period.\\nA treatment of physical age data that harmonizes with the historical data in the Bible and is also as persuasive as the long-age interpretations given in this book will probably never be developed. The basis for my confidence in making such a prediction is the extreme improbability that there will be a sufficient number of individuals with adequate information and adequate financing coordinated for development of models that incorporate biblical specifications to the same degree of their potential that models which contradict biblical specifications have been developed to their potential.\\nThere probably are few, if any, individuals who have developed implicit confidence in biblical testimony solely on the basis of supporting evidence from the natural sciences. But confidence in the character of God, and in the universality of truth, requires confidence that models can be developed which coordinate observations from the natural sciences with the witness of inspired testimony in a manner that meets the highest academic standards for interpreting each. In the search for truth there should be scientifically minded individuals who have the humility to recognize that some incorrect interpretations of physical data might be identified by specifications in the Bible, and there should be religiously oriented individuals who have the humility to recognize that some cases of reading more into the Bible than its Author and writers intended to convey might be identified by data acquired through scientific investigation. Models that harmonize both sources of specification do not need to be the most popular, or be widely accepted; but they must be true to the full range of evidence and to sound principles of interpretation. Geyh and Schleicher have given us a valuable resource for progress on the development of such models.\\n                \\n                \\n                \\n                \\n            ', 'date': '1990-06-01', 'url': 'https://www.grisda.org/origins-17082'}, {'title': 'More Than a Revision\\n', 'author': 'Robert H.

NY: John Wiley and Sons. 589 p.\\nThe first edition (1977) of this book was reviewed in Origins 6(1):47- 48. When the second edition appeared I did not anticipate that a follow- up review would be a significant contribution. As I consulted the second edition I began to realize that it merited an independent review.\\nThe second edition contains nine more chapters (for a total of 28) and 125 more pages than the first edition. Many of the carry-over chapters are substantial revisions. The recently developed samarium-neodymium and lutecium-hafnium dating techniques are fully treated in the second edition. Unsurpassed convenience of access to the technical literature is provided by the fully updated references throughout. There is an average of 2.9 pages of literature references per chapter.\\nThe book is exceptionally well written, with a clear, fascinating style. The reader is “led by the hand”, step by step, in the mathematical development of formulae for interpreting radioisotope data. Quantitative illustrative examples are explained carefully. In addition to the technical treatment there is historical background information that adds to the enjoyment of reading and to the ease of comprehension. In each category there is a thorough discussion of the various assumptions that must be made to interpret a radioisotope “age” in terms of real time. Throughout the book there are examples of success and of failure in the effort to obtain a valid chronological conclusion from radioisotope data. Most of these examples represent success, but sufficient failures are presented to give the discerning reader a sound perspective.\\nIn his discussion of rubidium-strontium dating Professor Faure says:\\nUnquestionably, ‘discordance’ of mineral dates is more common than ‘concordance’. ... the mineral dates generally are not reliable indicators of the age of the rock (p 120-121).\\nIn his summary of Chapter 8 he says that a rubidium-strontium date for sedimentary rocks “may refer to the age of the source rocks, or to the age of diagenesis or metamorphism” (p 136), rather than to the time of deposit.\\nIndividuals who have not recognized the difficulty of determining whether a plot of the ratio of two sequentially related isotopes in a suite of samples is an isochron or a mixing line will find Chapter 9 and also pages 327-331 of Chapter 19 enlightening.\\nThe treatment in Chapter 14 makes it evident that samarium- neodymium ages for “fine grained detrital sedimentary rocks are similar to those for the igneous and metamorphic rocks from which they were derived” (p 246), and do not relate to the time when these sediments were initially formed.\\nFor individuals who have taken a simplistic view of uranium-lead and thorium-lead radioisotope age determinations, Professor Faure’s statement on page 291 is significant:\\nAlthough examples of nearly concordant U, Th-Pb dates can be found in the literature ... in most cases U- and Th- bearing minerals yield discordant dates whose geological significance is questionable. \\nChapter 18 gives an extended discussion of highly significant improvements in the techniques for zircon dating and in the interpretation of zircon uranium-lead ages that have been made since the first edition was written. In Chapter 19 the author points out that in general “the dates calculated from the single stage model [for radiogenic lead accumulation] do not agree well with the geologic ages of the associated rocks” (p 334).\\nChapters 24-28 treat the information that may be provided by variations in the ratios of the stable isotopes of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen and sulphur. For example, the 13C/12C ratio “of the carbon in coal is similar to that in modern land plants and apparently does not vary significantly with increasing rank of the coal or its geologic age” (p 493). Biblical creationists have a challenge to develop a sound alternative explanation for the sulphur isotope patterns in sediments, coal, and petroleum that are discussed in Chapter 28.\\nIn the estimation of this reviewer, the second edition of Faure’s classic text is the prime reference for anyone concerned with isotope interpretation on a chronologic basis, and it must be read, and understood, by anyone who attempts an interpretation of radiometric age data from a biblical perspective.\\n                \\n                \\n                \\n                \\n            ', 'date': '1989-01-01', 'url': 'https://www.grisda.org/origins-16032'}, {'title': 'Implications of C-14 Age vs Depth Profile Characteristics\\n', 'author': 'Robert H. Brown', 'doc': 'IMPLICATIONS OF C-14 AGE VS DEPTH PROFILE CHARACTERISTICS\\nbyR. H. BrownGeoscience Research Institute\\nWHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT \\nIntensive analytical treatment of C-14 age profile data indicates that during prehistoric time either the biosphere C-14/C-12 ratio has increased, or the world average sedimentation rate has increased, while peat accumulation rates have decreased. A model based on biosphere C-14/C-12 ratio increase is suggested by the biblical chronologic data in the book of Genesis, and is favored by paleoclimate considerations against a model based on sedimentation rate increase. The currently accepted dendrochronologic framework requires a biosphere C-14/C-12 ratio decrease, and therefore supports a model based on sedimentation rate increase. Aside from dendrochronologic considerations, there is a basis for proposing that sediment, soil, and peat accumulation rates have generally decreased during the prehistoric period following glaciation. Biblical chronologic data taken together with recent Accelerator Mass Spectrometry C-14 data provide a basis for postulating that the biosphere C-14/C-12 ratio has increased more than 70-fold, but less than 500-fold since the global catastrophe described in the 7th and 8th chapters of Genesis. This increase could be due to an increase in the rate of C-14 production and a decrease in the carbon inventory in the carbon exchange system. \\nThe radiocarbon age of organic material in sediments would be expected to increase in a linear relationship with depth of sediment if geologic and geochemical processes have always had the same characteristics as in recent times. The available data on C-14 age profiles indicate that the characteristic relationship is nonlinear in a direction which suggests that the C-14/C-12 ratio was less in the past than it is now.\\nIntroduction\\nThe relationship between radiocarbon age data and the chronological data in the fifth and eleventh chapters of Genesis has been examined in previous issues of ORIGINS [2:6-18, 58 (1975); 6:30-44 (1979); 7:9-11 (1980)]. The first of these treatments utilized a crude quantitative description of C-14 age versus depth profile shape and concluded that the deeper portions of these profiles are most likely to be concave toward the C-14 age axis, showing less sediment per C-14 time unit than shallower deposits. Such profile shape could be due to an increasing C-14/C-12 ratio in the biosphere during the early (prehistoric) stages of sediment accumulation and peat growth, increasing accumulation rates as sediment and peat features developed, or a combination of these circumstances. The conclusion in the 1975 treatment, that \"C-14 ages in the prehistoric range should be expected to be progressively in excess of the real time involved\", was strongly supported by the sediment data set of 60 profiles, and mildly supported by the peat data set of 39 profiles.\\nData Base\\nThe purpose of this presentation is to acquaint ORIGINS readers with a more extensive and more rigorous investigation reported in Radiocarbon (Brown 1986). The report in Radiocarbon is based on 170 sediment, 114 peat, and 25 soil profiles. All sediment and peat features that provided the data base for the 1975 report in ORIGINS are included in the data base for the 1986 Radiocarbon report. An attempt was made to include in the 1986 report all C-14 age vs depth profiles that have been reported in the scientific literature up through most of 1984. I am confident that this goal was adequately, though not fully, realized except for the scientific literature that was produced within the U.S.S.R. and its satellite countries.\\nAnalytical Treatment\\nEach set of C-14 age versus depth data in the recent investigation was analyzed using cubic regression for a smooth curve representation of the average data trend. The analysis was limited to profiles which were described by at least 7 data pairs, with the exception of 3 continental sediment and 2 peat profiles, each of which has 6 well-spaced, precisely determined data points. Profiles for which a cubic regression with a Coefficient of Determination (CRCD) of at least 0.70 could not be obtained were not included in the group analysis. Six continental sediment and 5 soil profiles failed to meet the 0.70 CRCD criterion. Sixteen continental sediment, 5 soil, and 9 peat profiles that met the 0.70 CRCD criterion were rejected on the basis of clear evidence that the feature had been disturbed during or since emplacement, or because the data range was too restricted to establish adequately a representative trend. Of the profiles, 170 sediment, 114 peat, and 25 soil survived these restrictions.Some readers may question the adequacy of a relatively simple cubic regression (second-order nonlinearity) to represent the raw C-14 age profile data. Table 1 gives the mean CRCD together with the range of this coefficient that includes 67% of the data set.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTABLE 1. Adequacy of Cubic Regression Fit. Coefficient of Determination = 1.0000 represents a \"perfect\" fit to the C-14 age versus depth data. The ± limits specify the range which includes 67% of the coefficients of determination.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAll profiles for which the smooth curve representation was only mildly curved were fitted with both a cubic regression and a linear regression. If the linear regression (straight-line fit) gave a lower Standard Error of Estimation than did the cubic regression, the profile was represented in group analysis by its linear regression. No deep ocean sediment profiles, 19 continental sediment profiles, one soil profile, and thirty peat profiles were better represented by a linear regression.For each profile a plot was made showing the raw conventional C-14 age (5568 year Libby half-life) vs depth data points, the best-fit regression line for the raw data, and the 95% confidence boundaries for the regression line, as illustrated in Figure 1. The slope of the regression line in C-14 years/cm was calculated for 2500-year intervals. If the slope (C-14 years/cm) at either of the extreme data points appeared questionable, the regression line was extrapolated as a straight line of slope compatible with the interior section. (The regression curve fitting process gives the best fit to the input data points, but may yield an incorrect slope of the regression line at the extreme points where there is constraint in only one direction. See Figure 1 for an example.)\\n\\nFIGURE 1. Peat profile from Beauchêne Island, Falkland Islands (data from Smith and Prince 1985). Dashed adjustment to regression line provides most reasonable estimate of slope and curvature at 2500 14C yr (see also Smith and Clymo 1985).\\n\\nFor each of the four feature types (deep ocean sediment, continental sediment, soil, and peat) the mean regression line slope in C-14 years/cm was determined for intervals of 2500 years. These mean values are represented by vertical bars in Figures 2-5. The filled portion of these bars represents the range within which the respective mean value has a statistical expectation of failing with 67 chances out of 100. The numbers at the top of each bar are the number of profiles in the data represented by the bar. Figures 2-5 represent only data for profile sections bounded by C-14 age determinations, i.e., no data from extrapolated regions are included. The line designated %/cm represents the average increase in C-14 years/cm between adjacent bars.\\n\\nFIGURE 2. Graphic summary of global slope characteristics of deep ocean sediment profiles.\\n\\n\\nFIGURE 3. Graphic summary of global slope characteristics of continental sediment profiles.\\n\\n\\nFIGURE 4. Graphic summary of global slope characteristics of soil profiles.\\n\\n\\nFIGURE 5. Graphic summary of global slope characteristics of peat profiles.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nThe data represented in Figures 2-5 clearly establish a global tendency for C-14 age increment per unit of depth to increase with depth, i.e., for the C-14 age profile to be concave toward the C-14 age axis, as in Figure 1. The three peat bog data sets which include 15,000, 17,500, and 20,000 C-14 years are an inadequate sample for determining global characteristics. Since there are such a large number of samples over the 0-10,000 C-14 year range, it is most reasonable to conclude that within the limits of the currently available data an average peat deposit profile should be expected to be linear. Accordingly, the profile represented in Figure 1 does not represent the most probable C-14 age versus depth (thickness) relationship for a peat deposit. Several factors that might affect the shape of a profile are discussed below.\\nCompaction may be expected to increase the C-14 age span per cm of depth in the lower portion of a deposit and produce a C-14 age profile concave toward the C-14 age axis. If compaction is an adequate explanation for the profiles depicted in Figures 2-4, the average density at profile depths associated with 15,000-year C-14 age must be 3.2, 4.2 and 4.8 times the average density at profile depths associated with 2500-year C-14 age for deep ocean sediment, continental sediment, and soil, respectively (ratio of C-14 years/cm ordinates). Such ratios are unreasonable since they require a sediment density greater than that of either granite or basalt. Furthermore, if compaction is a significant factor, it should be more pronounced among a group of thicker features than among a group of relatively thinner features. The average increase in C-14 years/cm per cm of depth should be greater (correlate positively) for relatively thick features than for relatively thin ones. Table 2 lists the Coefficient of Correlation between average increase per cm in C-14 years/cm and maximum depth for the profiles in the feature types described in Table 1.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTABLE 2. Compaction Analysis. Coefficient of Correlation between average increase per cm in C-14 years/cm and maximum depth for the profile groups described in Table 1.\\n\\nThe small negative correlation for sediments probably has no significance. The negative 0.47 correlation for soil profiles indicates that shallower soil profiles have a distinctly greater tendency to be concave toward the C-14 age axis than do deeper soil profiles. I have no explanation for a difference between soil and sediment profiles in this respect. The more positive correlation for peat profiles with respect to sediment profiles indicates that compaction has been a significant, but not major, factor in peat accumulations.\\nAnother possible cause of C-14 age profile concavity toward the C-14 age axis is contamination (Nambudiri et al. 1980), providing the degree of contamination by more ancient material progressively decreases with time. While allowance should be made for such possibility at some locations over some periods of time, it does not appear to provide a universally adequate explanation. Contamination by material of greater than contemporary age as a feature builds up by natural processes most reasonably should be negligible, uniform in time, or episodic. A uniform rate of contamination would have no effect on the C-14 age profile shape. Episodic contamination would produce a profile discontinuity that gives data points which do not fit the general profile trend. Such anomalous data are occasionally encountered and are easily recognized.\\nA universally adequate explanation for the sediment and soil C-14 age profile shape tendency seems to require a progressively increasing C-14/C-12 ratio in the supporting environment and/or progressively more rapid accumulation rates. Considerations relative to a C-14/C-12 ratio increase have been presented earlier (Brown 1979). Dendrochronologic correlations with C-14 age (e.g., Kromer et al. 1986) appear to limit changes in C-14/C-12 ratio to only a minor, rather than a dominant, role. The classical grammatical-historical interpretation of the Hebrew scriptures provides constraints on historical time that disallow the currently accepted dendrochronologic models for time prior to around 2000 B.C. (Hasel 1980a,b), and favor an increasing C-14/C-12 ratio as the dominant factor in sediment and soil C-14 age profile shape tendency. The evidence concerning paleoclimate does not indicate a steadily increasing global trend for sedimentation, erosion, and soil buildup rates throughout the late Pleistocene and early Holocene epochs. This is contrary to the possible explanation that the dominant factor in sediment and soil C-14 age profile shape might be changes in accumulation rate (Hecht 1985). The choice between increasing C-14/C-12 ratio and increasing accumulation rate will depend largely on the relationship between one\\'s confidence in a chronology based on the data in the first eleven chapters of Genesis and his confidence in the models for paleoclimate and dendrochronology that are in vogue.\\nAn additional factor that could produce a C-14 age versus depth profile concave toward the C-14 age axis for peat accumulations is decomposition (Clymo 1984). Decomposition allows organic material to be carried away in solution by percolating water. The older (lower) portions would be more depleted than the younger (upper) portion. Also compaction should be a more significant factor for peat profiles than for sediment and soil profiles. The Correlation Coefficient data in Table 2 is consistent with these considerations. Since the group average profile for peat deposits is essentially linear over at least a 10,000 C-14 year range (Figure 5), the global average peat accumulation profile (excluding the consequences of compaction and decomposition which produce a profile convex toward the depth axis) must be concave toward the depth axis over the same range of time. Such a characteristic specifies declining peat accumulation rates, at least over the early portion of the time covered by the last 10,000 C-14 years.\\nIf the C-14/C-12 ratio increases with time, a C-14 age based on a recent C-14/C-12 ratio will be increasingly greater than the corresponding real-time age. Consequently, an accumulation profile of C-14 age versus depth would be less concave toward the depth axis than the corresponding real-time age versus depth profile, and could be reversed to appear convex, as in Figure 1. Accordingly, the actual decline in a peat accumulation rate could be greater than might be inferred from a C-14 age versus depth profile.\\nTo eliminate an increasing C-14/C-12 ratio as a major factor in producing the profile characteristics displayed in this analysis, it would be necessary to have a world-wide climate trend favoring an increase in average sediment and soil accumulation rates. Since most of the peat bogs described in the literature are located in formerly glaciated areas, it seems to me more reasonable to presume that the global averages of both sediment accumulation rates and peat accumulation rates have declined over at least the early part of the Holocene.\\nC-14/C-12 Ratio Increase Limit\\nIf there has been a C-14/C-12 ratio increase in the biosphere, is there a basis for determining a probable value for this increase? Such a determination can be made if one has appropriate samples of known real-time age, equipment capable of determining the residual C-14/C-12 ratio in these samples, and techniques for determining the amount of C-14 contamination in them. Contamination could be due to a mixture of carbonaceous material older than the real-time age of the sample (C-14/C-12 ratio lower than the \"true\" value), or to transfer from contact with younger carbonaceous material (C-14/C-12 ratio greater than the \"true\" value).\\nThe data in the first eleven chapters of Genesis specify a major global catastrophic event that occurred within about ±500 years of 5000 years ago. Remains of organisms buried during this catastrophe would now be characterized by 51-58% of the C-14/C-12 ratio that characterized them at death. Since the C-14 in Earth\\'s biosphere is formed by interaction of cosmic ray protons with nitrogen atoms in the upper atmosphere, it is most reasonable to presume that the C-14/C-12 ratio in the pre-flood biosphere was greater than zero, specifically 72-96% greater (since 1/.51 = 1.96 and 1/.58 = 1.72) than that which now characterizes the remains of organisms buried during the Noachian flood.\\nThe Twelfth International Radiocarbon Conference featured reports from seven laboratories on the present capabilities of the nuclear accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) technique for direct counting of C-14 atoms [Radiocarbon 28(2A):177-255 (1986)], the most refined and sensitive technique for C-14 age determination. Table 3 summarizes the C-14 age threshold data in these reports. Since column 4 combines data from seven different laboratories, the numbers given therein should be considered as only rough estimates of what might be expected in any particular laboratory. The meteorite listed in Table 3 would be expected to contain a trace of C-14 formed by spallation reactions with cosmic rays before its entry into Earth\\'s atmosphere.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTABLE 3. AMS Data for \"Infinite\" C-14 Age Samples. Data from seven laboratories reporting in Radiocarbon 28(2A):177-244. Column four is derived from column three.\\n\\nAssuming that \"infinite\" age samples are components of deposits made during the flood episode, and adding 72-96% to estimate C-14 activity at the time of burial/formation, the .0072-.0011 range in column 4 of Table 3 becomes .014-.002, or 1/71-1/500. The 1/71-1/500 range fraction of modern C-14 concentration could be entirely contamination during sample handling and preparation. There is also a possibility that it could be largely residual C-14. If residual C-14 is present, the 1/71-1/500 range probably represents varying proportions of residuum and contamination. From the perspective of a C-14 age model that includes the historical and chronological data in the first eleven chapters of Genesis, one can postulate that since the Noachian flood the biosphere C-14/C-12 ratio has increased more than 70-fold, yet probably less than 500-fold. Modeling considerations for such an increase have been discussed in Brown (1979).\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nIn the opinion of the writer, the extended and more intensive investigations reported here provide increased credibility for the conclusion offered in my 1975 treatment, viz., that C-14 ages in the prehistoric range should be expected to be progressively in excess of the real time involved.\\nWhile confidence in the historical and chronological data in the first eleven chapters of Genesis must be based on considerations which are independent of radioisotope-age data and accessible to individuals who are not in a position to understand such data , every effort should be made to develop a composite view (model) which harmonizes the data from these two sources. Those who seek such harmonization on a soundly logical and broad scientific base may find in the quantitative analysis presented here encouragement for assignment of the total range of C-14 dates for plant and animal remains to a 5000-year span of real time since the world cataclysm portrayed in Genesis 7 and 8.\\nLITERATURE CITED\\n\\nBrown, R.

BrownGeoscience Research Institute\\nRelated page |  REACTION |\\nSome recent radiocarbon dates derived from sources assumed to be geologically very old give dates in the 40,000-year range. These relatively young dates may reflect the concentration of Carbon-14 in the antediluvian atmosphere. Implications related to the antediluvian Carbon-14 production rate and the size of the biosphere are considered.\\nThe development of the Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) technique for measurement of radiocarbon (C-14) activity has renewed interest in the C-14 activity levels of \"infinite\" age samples. Infinite age samples are those considered too old to be dated by radiocarbon techniques. Over a period of time equal to ten half-lives, the activity of an isolated radioactive specimen will diminish by a factor of 210 or 1024. For 5730-year half-life C-14 this time period is 57,300 years. The sensitivity of the AMS technique is such that samples from a biosphere such as that which is now characteristic of planet Earth should exhibit detectable residual C-14 activity into the 60th millennium after isolation (i.e., over about 12 C-14 half-lives). As far as this technique is concerned, samples with a real-time age greater than 70,000 years would be in the \"infinite age\" classification.\\n\"Infinite age\" samples such as anthracite coal from deep mines in Carboniferous geologic formations (270-350 millions years conventional age assignment) have yielded AMS C-14 ages in the 40,000-year range at laboratories in Europe, Canada, and the U.S.A. (Brown et al. 1983; Jull et al. 1986; Beukens, Gurfinkel, and Lee 1986; Grootes et al. 1986; Nelson et al. 1986; and Bonani et al. 1986). The ready explanation for this unexpected result is contamination from the contemporary biosphere. Radiocarbon [Vol. 29, No. 3 (1987)] contains reports of two attempts to determine the limits of such contamination, one at Simon Frazer University in British Columbia (Vogel, Nelson and Southon 1987), and the other at the University of Toronto in Ontario (Gurfinkel 1987).\\nThe Simon Frazer University study indicates that machine background and sample preparation procedures do introduce uncertainty in C-14 age determinations on samples of anthracite smaller than about 400 micrograms. Forty-three samples of anthracite from Pennsylvania, U.S.A., that had been given the best-known pretreatment to remove contamination by modern carbon, and ranged in size from 0.5 to 20 milligrams, yielded a 43,000-year C-14 age, regardless of sample size. According to the authors\\' Table 1, less than 30% of the C-14 activity associated with this 43,000-year age limit could be assigned to machine background and contamination during sample preparation.\\nThe University of Toronto investigator (Gurfinkel 1987) stated that \"One of the major problems encountered in this study was the apparent presence of 14C contamination in samples that were assumed dead.... it could not be assumed that even the oldest samples were necessarily 14C free\" (p. 342). Her meticulous investigation using graphite, calcite, limestone, and anthracite samples concluded that \"infinite age\" samples should be expected to have \"contamination\" up to as great as that represented by a conventional 43,000-year C-14 age, similar to the results obtained by the Simon Frazer University group.\\nThese findings are of particular interest to individuals who are looking for models that relate the historical data in the Bible to modern scientific observations. Chapters 6-8 of the book of Genesis describe a universal catastrophe that reasonably may be expected to have produced most of the coal and shell fossil material, much of the limestone, and some of the calcite accessible today. Since terrestrial C-14 is produced almost entirely by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen, C-14 should have been present in the antediluvian biosphere as well as in the immediate postdiluvian and the contemporary biosphere.\\nThe C-14 production rate (R) and the active biosphere carbon inventory (I) may not have been the same in antediluvian time as at present. Consequently the equilibrium activity level (A) which is proportional to the ratio R/I may not have been the same then as that which characterizes the modern environment (13.6 spontaneous C-14 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon).\\nThe precise date for the Deluge of Genesis 6-8 cannot be determined because of variations in the source documents (Samaritan, Septuagint, and Masoretic manuscripts). The best we can affirm is that the source material specifies a universal destruction and reorganization of planet Earth\\'s surface most probably sometime within the range 2500-3500 years BC (Brown 1987). Accordingly, organic material buried in this catastrophe would now have a real-time age since burial in the range 4500-5500 years, and should now exhibit about 55% of the C-14 activity level that characterized the antediluvian world. Any C-14 age in excess of about 5000 years for such material could be attributed to a lower R/I ratio than that which characterizes the modern biosphere \\x97 a lower C-14 production rate (R), and/or a larger active biosphere carbon inventory (I).\\nAccording to the two research reports reviewed here, carbon from the antediluvian biosphere should now have a radiocarbon age of at lest 43,000 years. Allowing 5000 years since the Deluge leaves 38,000 years for the radiocarbon age characteristic of this material at the time of the Deluge. A 38,000-year C-14 age is equivalent to a C-14 specific activity 1.01% of the contemporary reference standard. This could indicate C-14 production at 1/99 of the present production rate, an active biosphere carbon inventory 99 times greater than that of the modern world, or any combination between these extremes as required for an R/I ratio of 1/99.\\nIf the sample preparation procedures introduce unidentifiable contamination by modern carbon, or do not remove all contamination that may be developed naturally, the radiocarbon age indicated for material at the time of the Deluge would be greater than 38,000 years. With a contamination effect as great as 30%, as possibly indicated by the Table 1 data supplied by the Simon Frazer University group, the C-14 age of Deluge deposits would be increased from 43,000 to about 46,000, or about 41,000 at the time of the Deluge. Such increase would lower the R/I ratio relative to that of the modern world to about 1/143.\\nThe approximate equivalence of C-14 age with real-time age over at least the last 3500 years indicates that C-14 concentrations in the upper biosphere (all but the deep ocean and ocean sediment) have been essentially at R/I equilibrium levels over this period of time. If for some reason C-14 levels had not reached equilibrium by the time of the Deluge, the antediluvian biosphere could be modeled on the basis of an R/I ratio higher than the 1/99-1/143 range [antediluvian biosphere carbon inventory lower than 99-143 times the current value, assuming the C-14 generation rate (R) was the same for both epochs].\\nIndividuals who wish to develop a model for the carbon content of the antediluvian biosphere within the constraints of the available data have considerable latitude. Without exceeding the constraints provided by paleomagnetic intensity data, the C-14 generation rate might be postulated to have been as low as 1/4 the modern value as a consequence of a higher geomagnetic field intensity that reduced the hazard of damage to organisms by cosmic radiation. The active carbon exchange inventory in the antediluvian biosphere then needs to be postulated in the range of only 25-40 times the present value, rather than 99-143. Since the total \"fossil\" organic carbon inventory on planet Earth is estimated to be roughly 250 times the carbon inventory in the present carbon exchange system (Olson 1985; compare 175-fold in Rubey 1951), and most of Earth\\'s surface is now desert (combined marine, arctic, temperate, and tropical deserts), an antediluvian world that is consistent with both modern C-14 data and biblical chronological data does not appear unreasonable.\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nBeukens, Roelf P., Debbie M.

Dallas TX: DMD Publishing Co. 176 p.\\nThis is not a book for the individual who is looking for an effective scientific defense of the flood, chronology, or creation as presented in the first eleven chapters of Genesis. But without hesitation I classify it as an essential addition to the library of everyone who is seeking to develop explanations for scientific data that are pertinent to the testimony of these chapters. The massive bibliography alone justifies such classification. Of equal value are the author’s critiques of the various attempts that have been made to develop a biblically supportive model for the pertinent scientific data. Since he makes his analyses from the viewpoint of sympathetic biblical literalism combined with scientific competence, some readers who have derived great comfort from a particularly narrow model of scientific creationism or flood geology will be deeply disturbed by Morton’s revelations.\\nNot all of Morton’s critiques are as thorough or as favorable as their target deserves, but in every case they contribute to the development of a more credible treatment of scientific data from a biblical perspective. In my judgment, Morton can be faulted for excessive insistence on rationalistic explanation. For example, he says that “there can be no world- wide flood” (p 83) if we cannot satisfactorily account for the source and the disposition of the water! Is our available data that complete, and our ability to understand that good?\\nMorton is convinced that all the pertinent scientific data from geomorphology to radioisotope age, fossil evidence for evolution of species, and astrophysics can be explained on the basis of a universal increase in permittivity (the dielectric constant of free space) during and since the year of the Noachian flood. This increase in permittivity has presumably caused the Earth to expand to double the diameter it had before the flood. The reader who does not accept this all-encompassing explanation will nevertheless gain fresh and beneficial insights from Morton’s various detailed attempts to justify it.\\nMorton’s handling of biblical sources is questionable when he rejects a chronology based on Genesis 5 and 11 on the basis that the Gospel of Luke (ch 3, v 36) lists a Cainan who is not included in Genesis 11 (p 125). Luke merely quotes from the Septuagint, a source which was prepared over 1100 years closer to Moses than was the Masoretic text on which our English translations are primarily based and which does give chronologic data for the extra Cainan. It is quite probable that both the Septuagint and the Masoretic give abbreviated name lists in Genesis 5 and 11. Omission of the names of some intervening individuals in no way renders meaningless the time intervals specified between those who are listed.\\nIn order to make his increasing permittivity model consistent and reasonable, Morton places creation not less than about 125,000 years ago, and not more than about 14 million years ago (p 126). If one abandons the less-than-10,000-years constraint from Genesis 5 and 11, why not accept the conclusions of the overwhelming majority of scientists that the universe as presently observed is the product of processes that have been in operation for probably in the order of 15 billion years, and that the Solar System has been in existence for about 4.56 billion years?\\nThe Geology of the Flood is spiralbound and printed at 17 characters per inch with a dot-matrix printer. It contains frequent typographical errors, a few of which impede the reader’s comprehension of the author’s thought. The most notable example is on page 144, paragraph 2, line 1, in which “was deposited rapidly, the shell” evidently has been omitted following “If the sand” and preceding “would not have time to wear away....” There is a good index of topics and proper names that appear in the text, along with a helpful index of the 51 figures and 21 tabulations it contains.\\nIn conclusion I wish to reemphasize the first four sentences of this review.\\n                \\n                \\n                \\n                \\n            ', 'date': '1987-06-01', 'url': 'https://www.grisda.org/origins-14082'}, {'title': 'A New General Reference on Carbon-14 Age Dating\\n', 'author': 'Robert H.

Orlando, FL: Academic Press, Inc. 212 p.\\nAs the title implies, this book was written for individuals who wish to understand radiocarbon dating, but do not have a strong background in physical science. The author is eminently qualified to provide both breadth and depth in a treatment of radiocarbon dating. He is currently professor of anthropology and director of the Radiocarbon Laboratory, Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics, at the University of California, Riverside. While a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles, he served as a research assistant in the isotope laboratory established by the late Willard F. Libby who developed the radiocarbon dating concept and pioneered the associated laboratory techniques.\\nThe text is amply illustrated and written in a clear, easily readable style. There is a broad discussion of techniques, as well as of the basic principles on which these techniques are based. Explanations from elementary principles are provided for readers who wish to understand the technical details. Extensive references provide easy access to the original literature. A reader who goes through the book rapidly will notice some repetition — repetition that provides for ease of understanding when interest may be limited to only a particular section or chapter.\\nThroughout the book, particularly in Chapter 5 (“Evaluation of Radio- carbon Data”), Dr. Taylor gives a thorough discussion of the difficulties and uncertainties in the translation of a C-14 measurement into an estimate of real-time calendric age. In Chapter 2 (p 16) he states, “The minimum overall level of uncertainty for an individual C-14 age estimate for middle and late Holocene [less than 6000 years old] samples is about 200 years.”\\nFor many individuals these discussions are worth more than the cost of the entire book.\\nThe final chapter (No. 6) gives a highly interesting history of the development of radiocarbon dating from the first suggestion concerning the existence of C-14 that was made in 1934 to the death of Willard Libby in 1980.\\nThe author and publisher are to be commended for a first edition remarkably free of errors. I can cite only two of any significance. In Figure 2:12 on p 33 the lower horizontal line designated “ca. 410 yrs” should extend to the extreme right vertical dashed line, not only to the vertical solid line at which the “ca. 265 yrs” horizontal line terminates. In each of the first two examples on p 138 the last line above “Age range” should be “years B.C.”, not “years B.P.”\\nDr. Taylor’s book meets a long-standing need for an up-to-date, comprehensive, authoritative and succinct treatment of radiocarbon dating.\\n                \\n                \\n                \\n                \\n            ', 'date': '1987-01-01', 'url': 'https://www.grisda.org/origins-14029'}, {'title': 'Some Questions about Geochronology\\n', 'author': 'Ariel A. Roth', 'doc': 'SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT GEOCHRONOLOGY\\nbyAriel A. RothGeoscience Research Institute\\nWHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT \\nThe presently accepted geochronological time scale for the earth proposes an age of about 4600 Ma (4600 million years). Sedimentary layers found on the continents of the earth contain evidences of past life (fossils) dated from very recent to several thousand million years. Evolution of life is assumed to have taken place during that time. This scenario contrasts dramatically with the biblical creation account which proposes that life on earth has existed for only a few thousand years. \\nThe geochronological time scale of thousands of millions of years is based mainly on radiometric dating — a dating system which has both strengths and weaknesses. On the other hand, some other time-dependent processes change at rates which challenge generally accepted geochronology. Examples include: \\n\\nThe present rate of erosion of the land surface of the earth would level the continents several hundred times over in 4600 Ma. \\nRivers carry sediment to the ocean at a rate that would fill the oceans at least 19× over in 3500 Ma, yet oceans are still very empty. Attempts to explain this by recycling sediments into the crust of the earth by various mechanisms are not very satisfactory. \\nPresent rates of sediment formation indicate that there should be 14- 23× as much as is found. Intermittent action is used as an explanation. \\nMountains are rising at rates of 100 km in 100 Ma. Intermittent action is again used to explain the discrepancy. \\nIn 3500 Ma, the present production rate of volcanic ejecta would produce 20-80× more than is now found. \\nThe human population grows so rapidly that its present size could have been reached in less than 1% (3200 years) of the minimum time assumed (1⁄2 million years) for man on the basis of radiometric dating. Also supporting a recent existence for man are the historical and archaeological data which are abundant but very recent. It does not seem that man (Homo sapiens) has been on this planet for 1⁄2 million years. \\nOn the other hand, the 4600 Ma assumed for the age of the earth is many orders of magnitude too short to account for the highly improbable events postulated for the evolutionary development of life. \\n\\nIt appears that quite a number of independent factors disagree with the presently accepted view of 4600 Ma for the development of the present earth system and the life contained therein. While the factors noted (except Factor 6) do not point to a few thousand years as indicated by the Bible, it is significant that the worldwide flood described in Genesis has the potential to cause Factors 1-5 to change more rapidly than at present and thus fit into the context of a few thousand years since creation. Creation itself has the potential to resolve any difficulty over the time required for evolutionary development (Factor 7). \\nAll extrapolations of present phenomena into the past must be approached with caution. A number of explanations have been proposed in the scientific literature for reconciliation of the discrepancies noted above with standard geochronology. These explanations propose that present geologic processes do not represent long-term averages. While this may be true in some instances, it is difficult to accept that all these various rates would be wrong. It appears that standard geochronological interpretations face some significant unresolved problems. \\nThere are time-dependent factors which, according to their present rates of change, are in disagreement with the standard scenario of thousands of millions of years for the geochronology of the crust of the earth.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nOne of the more significant differences between the concepts of creation and evolution is the amount of time required for the history of life on earth. Evolution proposes thousands of millions of years for the development of life to advanced forms. The biblical creation model proposes that life has existed for only a few thousand years.\\nEstimates of the age of the earth and the subsequent assumed time for the development of life have increased considerably during this century. Early concepts of ages of less than 100 Ma (100 million years) have gradually given way to figures more than 40 times as long (Engel 1969). Recent views are based on radiometric dating which is presently the most accepted method of determining geologic ages. It is sometimes called \"absolute dating\" a term that expresses the high regard given to this method. Based on the rate of disintegration of long-lived isotopes, estimates up to 6000 million years (6,000,000,000 years or 6000 Ma) have been proposed for the age of the earth. Major agreement has been reached on an age of around 4600 million years (4600 Ma) (Engel 1969). Within this time frame, there is general agreement that a major part of the continents (Kröner 1985) and oceans have existed for 3500 million years (3500 Ma). These latter long time concepts (4600 and 3500 Ma) will be designated in this essay as \"standard geochronology.\"\\nRadiometric age measurements sometimes disagree with one another and with other dating techniques. Damon and Kulp (l958), Brown (1983) and Taylor et al. (1985) refer to many examples. Disagreements are explained sometimes with convincing argumentation on the basis of inherited characteristics and/or subsequent geochemical disturbances in the rocks. However, the radiometric dates that provide the basis for the standard geologic time scale present a significant sequence. In addition to methods based upon radiometric dating, the slow rate of presently observed geologic changes also suggests that a great deal of time would be involved in the formation of some of the major features of Earth\\'s crust, including the thick accumulations of fossil-bearing (evidence of past life) sedimentary layers found therein.\\nOn the other hand, those who believe in creation as described in the Bible envision a short period of a few thousand years for the existence of life on our planet. This model includes a worldwide catastrophe the Genesis flood responsible for the rapid deposition of fossil-bearing sedimentary layers. This view is supported by the evidence of past catastrophic activity found in the sediments as well as the scarcity of evidence, especially in the main part of the geologic column, of the consequences that should have developed over long periods of time. Examples include the paucity of soils or preserved mature plant ecosystems. Deep erosional features such as buried canyons and cliffs should be much more abundant throughout the sedimentary layers, if these layers had been part of a sedimentary cycle existing over thousands of millions of years.\\nEach of the considerations listed above could be the subject of an extended discussion. This short survey will be limited to processes which, according to presently observed rates of change, appear to be in disagreement with the standard geochronological time scale of 4600 Ma.\\nUnfortunately, pertinent information dealing with this topic is not always firm. In many cases an undesirable, but unavoidable, degree of imprecision, conjecture and uncertainty is present. Nevertheless, the incongruities between some contemporary observations and standard geochronology are significant enough to suggest a reassessment of the currently accepted framework for geologic time.\\n1. Rate of Erosion of the Continents\\nBy noting the rates at which the surfaces of the continents are eroded and carried away by rivers to the oceans (see section 2 for specific values), one can calculate the length of time required to remove a given thickness of the continents. Judson and Ritter (1964) have estimated that for the United States the rate of erosion averages 6.1 cm/1000 years. At this rate of denudation the continents, which average 623 m above sea level, would be eroded to sea level in a mere 10.2 Ma. In other words, at this rate the present continents would be eroded over 340 times in the 3500 Ma assumed for the age of the continents. The observation by the famous geologist Powell that \"mountains cannot long remain mountains\" certainly seems appropriate. The estimate of 10 Ma given above has been a well-accepted figure (Schumm 1963) and has subsequently been referred to in a number of publications including Dott and Batten (1971, p. 136) and Garrels and Mackenzie (1971, pp. 114-115). Earlier, Dole and Stabler (1909) gave figures indicating that it would take about twice as long. Judson (1968), while correcting for human activity, suggests 34 Ma for complete erosion of the continents. None of these figures does much to alleviate the discrepancy which is especially significant when one considers mountain ranges such as the Caledonides of western Europe and the Appalachians of North America which are assumed to be several hundred Ma old. Why are these ranges here today if they are so old?Rates of erosion are greater in high mountains and lower in regions of less relief (Ahnert 1970, Bloom 1971, Ruxton and McDougall 1967, and Schumm 1963). Ruxton and McDougall (1967) report erosion rates of 8 cm/1000 years near sea level and 52 cm/1000 years at an altitude of 975 m in the Hydrographers Range in Papua. Rates of 92 cm/1000 years are reported for the Guatemala-Mexico Border Mountains (Corbel 1959), 100 cm/1000 years for the Himalayas (Menard 1961), and in the Mt. Rainier region of Washington Mills (1976) documents erosion rates of up to 800 cm/1000 years. Probably the highest recorded regional rate is 1900 cm/1000 years from a volcano in New Guinea (Ollier and Brown 1971).\\nIt has been suggested that mountains still exist because they are constantly being renewed by uplift from below. However, this process of uplift could not go through even one complete cycle of erosion and uplift without eradicating the layers of the geologic column found in them. Present erosion rates would tend to rapidly eradicate evidence of older sediments; yet these sediments are still very well-represented, both in mountains and elsewhere.Other attempts to reconcile average present erosion rates to geologic time include suggestions that man\\'s activities, especially agricultural practices, have increased the rate of erosion, making present rates uncharacteristically rapid. Such an explanation seems inadequate to account for a several hundred-fold discrepancy. Gilluly et al. (1968, p. 79) propose that farming may have increased average erosion rates by a factor of less than 2, while Judson (1968) suggests about 2½ times. Others have suggested that the climate of the past may have been more dry or the relief flatter, resulting in slower erosion rates. We now have some interior basins such as central Australia where there is no drainage and no removal of sediment, but these are exceptions. The lush vegetation evident in significant sections of the fossil record suggests at least some wetter conditions in the past.\\nCharacteristically, current erosion rates in hot, dry lowlands with gradients 0.001 or less, are not sufficiently slower. Corbel (1959) indicates rates of 1.2 cm/1000 years for the hot dry plains of the Mediterranean region and New Mexico. The lowest rates found in a study of 20 river basins (Ahnert 1970) was 1.6 cm/1000 years for basins in Texas and England. These slower rates do not solve a discrepancy of several hundred-fold, and one would have to postulate different past conditions for a major area of the earth during a significant proportion of earth history to provide a resolution to the problem.A different context can serve to emphasize the question of rates of erosion. If it is assumed that 2.5 km of continents have been eroded in the past (our present continents average about one fourth that thickness above sea level) and if it is assumed that erosion proceeds at the rate of 3 cm/1000 years (half of the presently observed rate to correct for the effects of modern agricultural pursuits), then it would take about 83 Ma to erode a 2.5 km thickness of continental crust. In other words, at present rates of erosion, continents 2.5 km thick could have been eroded 42 times during the assumed 3500 Ma age for the continents, or continents 106 km thick would have been eroded once. There is little question that there is some difficulty in reconciling present erosion rates with standard geochronology.\\n2. Sediments Carried to the Ocean\\nRivers and glaciers carry sediments and dissolved chemicals to the ocean, ocean waves erode the continental coastlines, and wind carries some fine sediment to the ocean. All these factors, along with submarine volcanism, contribute to the sediments that accumulate in the ocean. The observed rate of transfer of sediments from the continents to the ocean seems too rapid to be readily reconciled with standard geochronology.\\nMost of the sediment going into the ocean is transported by rivers. Estimates of sediment transport to the ocean for the world (Table 1) vary from 8000-58,000 million metric tons/year (Holmes 1965, p. 511; Holeman 1968; Jansen and Painter 1974; and Milliman and Meade 1983).\\n\\xa0\\n\\nMany of the estimates do not take into account the bedload which represents the sediments that are rolled or pushed along the bed of a river and which is not readily observed at river gauging stations. Sometimes the bedload is arbitrarily estimated at 10%, because it is so difficult to measure (Blatt et al. 1980, p. 23; Schumm 1963). Jansen and Painter (1974) suggest that 26,700 million tons/year for global denudation \"is likely to be an underestimate.\" Gilluly (1955) estimates that 13.6 km3 of solid material are carried to the world oceans every year. This corresponds to about 31,000 million tons/year. At this rate the ocean basins (including their present sediments), which have a total volume of 1550 million km3, should be filled in just 114 Ma. Using a more conservative estimate of river transport of sediment to the ocean of 20,000 million tons/year, it would still take only 178 Ma to fill these ocean basins with sediment. In other words, the present rate of transport of sediment by rivers could fill the oceans 19 times in 3500 Ma. Of course, the oceans, which average 3.8 km in depth of water, are not at all full of sediment; and in much of the deep oceanic abyssal plains, sediment thickness averages only a few hundred meters. It would take about 50 Ma to produce the generous estimate of 435 million km3 (Ronov and Yaroshevsky 1969) of sediment now found on the ocean and continental margins. One could argue that the continents were smaller in the past and produced less sediment. Such an argument would not resolve this discrepancy unless the continents were extremely small, and there is broad, but not unanimous, agreement that they have been near present size for the past 2500 Ma (Kröner 1985; Taylor and McLennan 1985, p. 234).\\nOn the other hand, three scenarios suggested within the standard geochronological paradigm may help alleviate some of the time discrepancy: a) the sediments are subducted into the earth at the deep trenches along the plate margins, as proposed by the plate-tectonics model, b) the sediments which originally came from the granitic continental crust are recycled again to form new continental crust by accretion or rifting processes, c) the river sediment which accumulates at the margins of the continents is recycled into other sediments again to be eroded. None of these scenarios provides a satisfactory explanation. They will be discussed in the order listed.\\na) It is sometimes proposed that the reason there is so little sediment in the oceans is that the oceanic crust is too young, the older ocean floor and sediment having been subducted into the mantle of the earth. However, subduction of sediments is not going on at a rate that would keep up with the supply given by rivers (Karig and Kay 1981, Kay 1980, and Veizer and Jansen 1979). Li (1972) has estimated the subduction rate to be at 2500 million tons/year, in contrast to present river delivery of 20,000-30,000 million tons/year. Lisitsyn et al. (1982) estimate subduction at about 3000 million tons/year, while Howell and Murray (1986) propose that only 21% of the sediment load of rivers ends in the oceanic trenches where subduction occurs. Furthermore, one must take into account that the major repositories of sediments from big rivers on the floor of the ocean are geographically unrelated to subduction zones (Potter 1978; Taylor and McLennan 1985, pp. 240-241).\\nb) Probably the most serious problem faced by those who propose a recycling of sediments into the thick \"granitic\" crust forming the continents is the mismatch between the chemical composition of sedimentary and of igneous-metamorphic (granitic) rocks. The original granitic rocks are assumed to have been the parent source of the sediments which in turn are changed from sediment back to the igneous-metamorphic rocks forming new continental crust. The main mismatch is with sedimentary limestones which have a proportion of elements that is different from the proportion in the supposed parent-daughter igneous-metamorphic rocks (Garrels and Mackenzie 1971, p. 237). The difference is emphasized by the fact that one finds more than twice as much limestone in the sedimentary rocks as would be expected if they were derived from igneous rocks. The average of 5 studies (Pettijohn 1975, pp. 21-22) involving direct measurement indicates 20% limestone, while the average of 4 studies utilizing calculations from the composition of igneous rocks indicates only 8% limestone. Also, the average igneous rock has more than 3 times as much sodium as the average sedimentary rock (Garrels and Mackenzie 1971, p. 237). The latter authors also indicate that carbon, which forms several percent (4.7% compared as oxide) of sedimentary rocks, is present only as a trace in igneous rocks. It is sometimes assumed that carbon had to come originally from a degassing process from the planet\\'s mantle. The general picture is that there are some significant differences in the elemental composition of sedimentary and igneous rocks. The kinds of minerals found in the two are very different. Mention should be made of Garrels and Mackenzie\\'s (197 1, p. 248) effort to resolve the question of the origin of limestone from igneous rocks by proposing that limestone could be derived in part from very large quantities of Precambrian volcanic sediments.\\nc) If only sediments at the continental margins are involved in the recycling process, the rate of discharge of sediments from rivers is so great that very rapid recycling would be required. These rates seem too high to have preserved the older sediments that still exist. Ronov and Yaroshevsky (1969) estimate the volume of sediments on the continental margins to be 190 million km3, equivalent to 8×1017 tons. One can conservatively assume that before the development of agriculture the rivers carried an estimated 10,000 million tons annually to the ocean, and 20% of this went to the deep trenches. According to the recycling of sediments model, the remaining 8,000 million tons/year must be recycled into other sediments near the continental margins. At this rate the 8×1017 tons would be recycled on an average once every 100 Ma (8×1017 divided by 8×109). Yet major parts of the geologic column considered much older than this are found on the continental margins and on areas considered to have been continental margins, including unique abundant Paleozoic and significant Precambrian limestone deposits. There are major deposits of Precambrian sediment older than their putative 600 Ma age in many regions of the world. Estimates of the proportion of sediments that are Precambrian vary from 1/5 to 1/2 (Garrels and Mackenzie 1971, p. 249). It does not seem that if there was general recycling at the rate of once every 100 Ma, there would be very much of these ancient sedimentary deposits still preserved. One would also expect considerable recycling of fossils which usually appear in their primary unique position of burial in the geologic column. Furthermore, it does not seem satisfactory to suggest that rapid recycling has taken place only within very limited parts of the geologic column. That does not appear to be occurring now. Usually major sections of the geologic column are exposed and eroded in our river basins. Both young and old sediments are involved in much of the erosion now observed. Restricted recycling is not normative to our present earth.\\nIt appears that the rivers carry sediments to the ocean at a rate that is too rapid to easily accommodate the long periods of time proposed by standard geochronology.\\n3. Rate of Sediment Accumulation {6 jan 2000 note by author: this section may need updating}\\nAround the turn of the century a number of studies compared observed rates of accumulation of sediments with the maximum thickness obtainable from the various individual parts of the geologic column (e.g., Figure 1) over the world. These maxima sometimes totaled more than 100,000 m in thickness. While the results obtained are highly variable, present rates of deposition of sediments are so rapid that they all point to a younger age than that of standard geochronology. Eicher (1976, p. 14) gives a summary of 19 such studies which average 246 Ma, or 1/14 of the 3500 Ma of standard geochronology.\\n\\nFIGURE 1. Deep sedimentary layers found on the east end of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River in Arizona. Sediments are quite abundant in many localities, but much less is present than would be expected over thousands of millions of years.\\n\\nOther more recent studies also support a paucity of sediments when compared to long geologic time. Gregor (1968) attributes to episodism (i.e., various episodes with differing rates of activity) the discrepancy between the relatively small amount of sediment present and the thousands of millions of years for sediment production. Assuming a rate of denudation to produce sediments at the rate of 3 cm/1000 years, he suggests that in 3500 Ma, 23 times as much sediment as now exists should be present. At this assumed rate the present sediments would have been produced in about 152 Ma.\\nA number of studies (see Gilluly 1949 for listing) have shown the intriguing relationship that younger sediments show greater thickness per equivalent unit of time than older ones. In other words, the rates of deposition appear more rapid for more recent deposits. Conversely, one could also interpret this as meaning that the time assumed for the deposition of older sediments is inordinately long. Newell (1972) gives a set of examples starting with slow rates of 0.6 to 6 cm/1000 years (Kay 1955) for average deposition since the Precambrian and ending with Rusnak\\'s (1967) estimate of a current rate of 100 to 200 cm/1000 years for bays, estuaries, and lagoons. Much more rapid rates are observed in exceptional cases such as the Mississippi delta (30,000 cm/1000 years), but these exceptions have limited significance for the general picture. The comprehensive data of Sadler (1981) based on 25,000 samples emphasizes the reality of the general picture presented above, and there is general agreement that present rates of sediment accumulation appear faster than can be easily extrapolated to the past\\nSeveral explanations have been proposed. It is commonly suggested that we are in a period of rapid sedimentation. In the past the mountains were lower, hence erosion and deposition was slower (see Gilluly 1949 for review). Incidentally, a low topography for the past fits well with several models of the Genesis flood presently under study. Another explanation is that the farther back one goes in time, the more incomplete the record is (Gilluly 1949, Sadler 1981). The argument is that the more time there is, the greater the opportunity for periods of non-deposition to occur. If episodism is a highly random factor, such an explanation seems plausible. Still others propose that recycling of sediments has transferred older sediments into younger ones (Garrels and Mackenzie 1971, Veizer and Jansen 1979), hence the scarcity of the older sediments. In section 2 we discussed some of the problems with recycling. On the other hand, the observed general decrease in the volume of sediments through time (as one goes down the geologic column) agrees with recycling. This observation might also be interpreted as a phenomena of basin infilling where the older (lower) sediment would have smaller volumes due to greater restriction in the lower regions of depositional basins. Regardless, the general decrease in sediment volume as one goes back in geochronological time is quite erratic (see figs. 10.1 and 10.9 in Garrels and Mackenzie 1971). It is irregular enough that Gregor (1968, 1970) proposes two cycles of sediment building instead of the usual one within the Phanerozoic. One can also consider the possibility that the reason for the scarcity of sediments in the past is not slower rates of accumulation but a shorter time for accumulation. Regardless of interpretation, there is an incongruity between present sediment rate production and the amount expected over the time proposed by standard geochronology.\\nOne might wonder whether erosion of the continents is so rapid (section 1) that we would not expect to see much sediment anyway. Erosion both produces and transports sediment, but the sediment must be deposited somewhere, and we should find it, unless it has been recycled. However, as shown in section 2, recycling is not an easy answer.\\n4. Rates of Uplift of Mountains\\nOur \"solid earth\" is not as firm as we usually surmise. When careful measurements are made, we find that some areas of the continents are slowly rising, while others are subsiding. Current rates at which these changes are occurring are too rapid to represent long geologic processes over many millions of years.\\nThere are two main methods of establishing the rate of orogeny (uplift) of mountains. One is by direct precise measurements noting accurately the altitude of a mountain at a given time and remeasuring its height a few years later. This gives the observed rate of uplift. The other is by indirect \"geologic studies\" comparing the height of a mountain with the time assumed for uplift based on standard geological and geochronological interpretations. This latter method gives average assumed rates. Measured rates of uplift are more rapid than those based on indirect geochronology. For instance, current uplift of the eastern and central part of the Alps of Switzerland (Figure 2) is about 100-150 cm/1000 years (Mueller 1983) when measured directly. Using indirect geological studies gives a rate of only 3 cm/1000 years (Zeuner 1958, p. 360), or 3% of the present measured rate.\\n\\nFIGURE 2. View looking southwest into the central Alps as seen from Gornergrat, Switzerland. Precise measurements show that this region is rising at the rate of about 1 mm/year. This rate, if extended over 100 Ma, would raise the region by 100 km. Three glaciers are evident across the valley.\\n\\nSchumm (1963) states that \"Rates of orogeny being measured at the present instant of geologic time [direct precise measurement] are far in excess of the minimum values obtained by geologic studies.\" Schumm reviews some of the literature dealing with present rates of orogeny and concludes that mountains form at a rate approaching 760 cm/1000 years. The same rates are found in southern California hills (Schumm 1963) and the southern Appalachians (Hand, quoted in Press and Siever 1982, p. 484) where there has been no glaciation that might induce some orogeny due to ice removal. In Japan Tsuboi (1933) measured rates as high as 7200 cm/1000 years. Blatt et al. (1980, p. 30) state that \"rates of uplift of mountains are fast,\" ranging from 300-1000 cm/1000 years. Hand (quoted in Press and Siever 1982, p. 484) reports present-day regional uplift in the Rocky Mountain region of 100-1000 cm/1000 years, and 0-1000 cm/1000 years are indicated for the Appalachian region. On the other hand, areas such as parts of the east and southern coast of the United States are subsiding at comparable rates. Senftl and Exner (l973) report orogeny of 100 cm/1000 years for the Hohen Tauern of the Austrian Alps. Precise direct measurements are not available for the Himalayas; however, on the basis of geomorphic evidence, also the finding of recent tropical plant and rhinoceros fossils which appear uplifted 5000 m, and on the basis of tilted beds, an estimate of a present uplift rate of 500 cm/1000 years is proposed (Gansser 1983). It also appears that Tibet has been uplifted at a similar rate. On the basis of geomorphic and erosion data, the same author estimates an uplift rate of about 300 cm/1000 years for the central Andes.\\nThe rate of 760 cm/1000 years proposed by Schumm (1963) would yield an uplift of 7.6 km in a million years. Using a more conservative rate of 100 cm/1000 years still suggests that the process could not continue over very long periods of time at the present measured rates, for at this rate the height of mountains could theoretically reach 100 km in 100 Ma. To explain the discrepancy a special case is proposed where mountains rise with \"\\'pulses\\' of rapid uplift\" (Blatt et al. 1980, p. 30). Schumm (1963) also suggests that these data support rapid uplift with little time for erosion before uplift is completed. Recognizing that the present rate of uplift cannot be extended throughout standard geochronology, these authors explain the difference by episodism. The present is assumed to be in a period of rapid orogeny.\\nIt should be noted that the rapid rates of erosion presently occurring are too slow to keep up with the rates of uplift noted in mountain formation. Schumm (1963) points out that modern rates of orogeny of 760 cm/1000 years are about \"8 times greater than the average maximum rate of denudation.\" Blatt et al. (1980, p. 30) illustrate the same point by referring to the fact noted above that erosion is more rapid in high mountains and gradually decreases toward lower elevations. Using the data of Ahnert (1970), they estimate that for erosion to keep up with a \"\\'typical\\' rate of mountain uplift\" of 1000 cm/1000 years, a mountain would have to be in the order of 45 km high. The present rate of uplift of mountains is too rapid to fit directly into standard geochronology.\\nOne might ask if the rapid rate of uplift of mountains now observed does not negate the first point presented earlier that the continents including their mountains should have been eroded several hundred times over in the thousands of millions of years of their proposed existence. The challenge to standard geochronology is that if mountains have been uplifting at current rates or even much slower, the lower parts of the geologic column which are many hundreds to thousands of millions of years old should have been uplifted and eroded away long ago. Yet these older sections are very well-represented in our mountain ranges, as cursory field study or examination of geologic maps will reveal.\\n5. Emission of Volcanic Ejecta\\nGregor (1968), while proposing episodism, has indicated that on the basis of an estimated 1 km3 of volcanic ejecta per year on the earth, there should be an average layer of volcanic deposits 7 km deep in 3500 Ma. Gregor\\'s figure of 1 km3/year seems supported by recent volcanic activity. Izett (1981) lists the volume of some of the more notable ash beds formed from volcanic activity: Tambora (Indonesia, 1815) 100-300 km3, Krakatoa (Indonesia, 1883) 6-18 km3, Katmai (Alaska, 1912) 20 km3, Mt. St. Helens (Washington, 1980) 1 km3. Mt. St. Helens ejected a significant volume of other volcanic products in addition to the ash considered above. To be added to this list are the numerous smaller volcanic events over the surface of the earth, such as occur periodically in Hawaii, Indonesia, Central and South America, Iceland, Italy, etc. All of this should average quite a bit more than 1 km3/year.\\nDecker and Decker (1982, p. 47) suggest an average volcanic output of about 4 km3/year. Estimates of the quantity of volcanic products now found on the earth are difficult to determine because of the problem of identification and because of mixing with other sediments. Garrels and Mackenzie (1971, p. 249) suggest that 25% of the volume of sediments are volcanic in origin. One can obtain an estimate of the volume of volcanic products by applying this proportion to the total sediment volume of the earth. Pettijohn (1975, p. 20) lists 8 estimates of the total volume of sediment. They average 683 million km3. If 25% of this is volcanic, we get a figure of 170 million km3 of volcanic ejecta on the earth. If we use the estimate of Gregor (1968) of volcanic production of 1 km3/year, we would get 3500 million km3 in 3500 million years, which is 20 times as much as appears to be present. If we use the estimate of Decker and Decker (1982, p. 47) of production rate of 4 km3/year, we would expect 80 times as much as now appears present.\\nThe simplest way to solve the discrepancy within a standard geochronological paradigm is to suggest episodism (Gregor 1968) and assume that we are in a much more active period of volcanic production. Another way is to recycle past production into the earth. Some of the problems of recycling were considered in section 2. If one excludes these alternatives, a present rate of production by volcanoes of 4 km3/year when extended over 3500 Ma would exceed the total volume of the crust of the earth.\\n6. Human Population Growth Rates\\nIt does not take much reflection for us to realize that mankind is a growing and ubiquitous entity on the face of the earth. Overcrowding is a serious and all-too-common problem. World population is growing exponentially, doubling every 35-40 years (Information Please Almanac 1986, p. 132). Calculating backwards from the present (in reverse) at this rate, one would come to two individuals (necessary to start a population) in a mere 1100 or 1200 years. Data based on growth from the middle of the 17th century to the present suggest a slower rate of growth according to which the present world population would have been produced in about 3200 years. To account for the ½ Ma assumed for the existence of man according to radiometric inference, it is suggested that man (here limited to Homo sapiens) did not reproduce as rapidly in the past. However, the discrepancy is so great that it seems proper to ask if man has been here for ½ Ma or more. Why has the earth become heavily populated only very recently? Figure 3, based on Coale (1974), illustrates the contrast between present growth rates and proposed earlier rates based on assumed long ages for man. (Coale uses a broader definition for man; hence his time span is greater than ½ Ma.) Coupled with the population growth considerations is the brief period of a few thousand years for the archaeological and historical data left by man. If man has been on earth for ½ Ma, should not archaeological and historical records extend further back in time? Should we not find firm evidence of human activity such as cities and roads hundreds of thousands of years old? Good evidence of past human activity is abundant and very recent. All three of these factors, the historical, the archaeological, and the biological rate of reproduction suggest that man has been here for only a small fraction of the time proposed by standard geochronology.\\n\\nFIGURE 3. Overview of the size of the human population and its rate of growth based on assumptions that man has been on this planet for a million years. The solid line represents population; the dashed line represents rate of growth. The curves show a distinct change during the last few thousand years. Curves based on Coale 1974.\\n\\nThe usual explanations given for the sudden change in rate of growth are that the development of agriculture a few thousand years ago permitted man to reproduce faster (Coale 1974), or that man may be more healthy now. Before this, man is assumed to have been a hunter and gatherer and/or more critically affected by disease. However, one can ask why man with all his inventive faculties as seen in the myriads of inventions about us should wait about ½ Ma to develop agriculture or health principles. The data seem to suggest that man has not been here for the time proposed by standard geochronology.\\nIt can also be argued within an evolutionary paradigm that man could have become more advanced by some rapid evolutionary changes. However, the very recent appearance of major advances in man in contrast to the earlier slow evolutionary developments demands explanation.\\nWhile the question of man\\'s past is a complex one, and significant caution seems warranted, his rather sudden authentication seems to provide some basis for questioning the putative antiquity which geochronology implies for him.\\n7. Time Required for Biological Evolution\\nCharles Darwin (1809-1882) refined and popularized the concept of organic evolution in his work The Origin of Species (1859). He knew that his proposal of small random changes guided by natural selection would require enormous amounts of time for the production of successful complex organisms. He suggested that 300 Ma had elapsed since the last part of the Mesozoic Era (Eicher 1976, p. 10). Interestingly this is more than 4 times longer than the 65-70 Ma proposed for this period by standard geochronology. While Darwin\\'s view can now be considered only of historical interest, it is noteworthy that even then he was keenly aware of the tremendous amount of time necessary for the improbable events postulated by his theory.\\nThis problem has taken on more significance in the context of modern molecular biology. For instance Eden (1967) in Mathematical Challenges to the Neo-Darwinian Interpretation of Evolution infers that an assumed age of 5000 Ma for the earth is far too short for the improbable events proposed by current evolutionary concepts. Eden uses the well-studied bacterium Escherichia coli as an example. In the genetic information found on the chromosomes of this and other organisms, a double order is found. The chemical pattern for the composition of the genes themselves is one order of information, but in addition the genes are found on the chromosomes at specific localities which are related to the order of use by the organism for sequential biochemical changes. Aside from the problem of evolving the genes, one wonders how the genes became located in their proper order. Eden addresses the simple question of getting only 2 genes in order. It is postulated that these genes evolved earlier at random localities on the chromosomes. Eden estimates that it would take 5000 Ma for the changes necessary to bring 2 genes in their proper order of use. This calculation is based on observed rates of reproduction and the generous assumption that this bacterium would have been spread over the earth in a layer 2 cm thick for that extended period of time. The 5000 Ma give no time for the genes to evolve a much more complex process \\x97, nor does it give time for the evolution of other organisms, some of which are several hundred times more complex. Suffice it to say that many orders of magnitude of time more than the 4600 Ma postulated for the earth are required for the improbable events of the scenario of organic evolution.\\nEvolutionary biologists have studied a number of factors that might increase the rate of evolutionary change. Considered especially significant are changes in regulatory or control genes (Hedrick and McDonald 1980, MacIntyre 1982) which may be more influential than ordinary genes. However, the evolutionary significance of regulatory genes would have little to do with the time problem posed above about the order in gene location.\\nIn the case of the evolutionary development of complex biological systems by naturalistic means, we find a factor that requires much more time than that provided by the standard geochronological time scale. The significance of this is complex. In a purely naturalistic context it raises questions about the validity of geochronology which thus appears too short. In a broader context that includes the possibility of creation, the time incongruity would be resolved.\\nSOME INFERENCES FROM THE DATA\\nThe time conflict between some observed phenomena and standard geochronology are summarized in Table 2.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nWhile some of these factors are subject to further adjustments, one gets the impression that within the context of standard geochronology a number of factors are currently changing at inordinately rapid rates.\\nThe scientific literature suggests some explanations as given above for each case. However, how can one plead a variety of special cases for time-dependent factors and still maintain confidence in current geochronological interpretation? It is logically unsettling to sometimes claim consistency between the present and the past, and then plead for special cases when the data do not fit accepted views. There seems to be some basis for wondering if the paradigm of standard geochronology has been given unwarranted acceptance. While man\\'s meager knowledge makes inconsistencies unavoidable, when we face a number of them, it may be time for some reevaluation.\\nSimple reflection on the time factors described above would likewise raise questions about inconsistencies between the data presented and the short time period for life on earth as proposed by the biblical model of creation. Most of the data presented above, except Factor 6, do not point to a few thousand years. For instance, if mountains are rising at the rate of 1 km/Ma, why are some mountains so high if they are so young? However, the biblical creation model (Neufeld 1974) includes both a creation by God and a worldwide flood that was a major catastrophe which dramatically changed the surface of the earth. Such unique events are difficult or impossible to analyze quantitatively, but they carry the potential to solve the discrepancies between the 7 factors listed in Table 1 and a short period of a few thousand years proposed by creation. The inordinately rapid rates in Factors 1-5 may reflect the effects of a single recent catastrophe such as the flood described in Genesis. Such a worldwide catastrophe would dramatically increase rates of erosion and sediment deposition, and such changes could be associated with mountain formation and even volcanism. Our present rates of change may reflect uncompleted adjustments to such an event. Supporting the plausibility of such an event is the fact that rapidly moving water increases its sediment transporting capacity (Figure 4) as the 3rd or 4th power of its velocity (Holmes 1965, p. 512). In other words, if one increases the speed of flow 10 times, moving water can carry 1000-10,000 times as much sediment. Such figures make the laying down of large sedimentary deposits, during a single worldwide flood event, appear highly feasible. A recent creation would also solve the problems of both the rapid human population growth rate and the lack of time for evolution of major life forms (Factors 6 and 7). One might argue that by invoking creation and a flood, one is likewise pleading a special case. However, creation and the flood are not such special cases for the biblical creation model; they are implicit to the model.\\n\\nFIGURE 4. Kanab Creek in southern Utah. A flash flood in 1886 cut a channel 15 m deep and 80 m wide in less than 8 hours (Gilluly 1968, p. 218).\\n\\nEven though the supernatural involvements which are implied in the postulated unique events of creation and the flood cannot be scientifically tested, we can evaluate evidence related to these such as a long or short time span for earth history, evidence of catastrophism, and plausibility of evolutionary changes. In our search for truth, it is better to acknowledge the possibility of unique events such as creation and the flood rather than to assume they did not occur.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThere are geological and biological factors which are currently observed to change at rates that are in disagreement with the standard geochronological interpretation of thousands of millions of years for the development of the crust and of life on earth. A number of alternative explanations have been proposed to bring about reconciliation, but these involve postulating an unsatisfying variety of special cases.\\nEvaluating factors dealing with the past warrants a great deal of caution. Extrapolation from the present involves some risk, and new observations and interpretations can readily alter conclusions for a past that is difficult to analyze. These problems apply to all dating scenarios. On the other hand, the recognized discrepancies with standard geochronology described herein appear significant and are based on several different tests. Because of this, some alternative views to standard geochronology appear credible.\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nAhnert, F. 1970.

Shell-model calculations of 99Tc beta decay in astrophysical environments. Physical Review C 33(1):296-302.\\nSummary. The purpose of this paper was to recalculate the half life of 99Tc (Technetium) in astrophysical environments. Previous calcu- lations at 3×108 oK gave a decay half life of about 5 years. This is shorter than the 10-100 year time scale usually suggested for formation. According to theory, then, no 99Tc would be expected at the stellar surface. In fact, it is abundant on at least some red-giant starts. The half-life calculated in this paper is 20 years instead of 5 years, removing the contradiction between theory and observation.\\nThere is general agreement between this and previous papers in that, whether the half life of 99Tc is 5 or 20 years at 3×108 oK, it is still 5 orders of magnitude shorter than the half life of 2.12×105 years observed at terrestrial temperatures. Theory gives the following order of magnitude half lives as temperature increases: 0 oK — 2×105 years; 1×108 oK — 2×105 years; 2×108 oK — 100 years; 3×108 oK — 10 years; 5×108 oK — 1 year. (For comparison the sun’s surface temperature is 6000 oK.) The decay rate changes because at high temperatures the 99Tc neutrons gain energy and are promoted from the ground state into several excited states. The spin of the ground state is such that beta decay to 99Ru is forbidden by selection rules. As a result this decay rate is slow. The spins of two of the excited states are such that beta decay is allowed by the selection rules, and the decay is much faster.\\nA NEW JOURNAL — AGAIN! \\nPALAIOS. Bimonthly, $75.00/year.

Box 4756, Tulsa, OK 74159-0756.\\nSummary. This journal appears to be a good one. The title is from the Greek “palaios,” meaning “ancient,” and the journal proposes to cover historical biology, especially where paleontology and biology become significant to geological interpretations. Nominally it covers paleontology, paleobiology, paleogeography, paleoecology, and paleoceanography. The two issues published to date cover topics from sedimentology to contemporary biology, with much emphasis on paleontological subjects. The composition of the journal includes more than a compilation of research reports. Divisions are: Online (editorial), Research Reports, Research Letters, New Books, News and Comments, and Afterthoughts (miscellaneous comments).\\nThis journal accommodates the much-needed interdisciplinary studies that are so important in the study of earth history. It is informal enough to allow some bold suggestions such as molluscan shells carried almost instantly 500 km offshore into the Atlantic Ocean by turbidity currents, and a reef from the near Europe Tethys Sea being rifted to eastern Oregon. Techniques of analysis of data and the study of preservation of organisms further enrich this useful journal.\\n                \\n                \\n                \\n                \\n            ', 'date': '1986-01-01', 'url': 'https://www.grisda.org/origins-13044'}, {'title': 'Amino Acid Dating\\n', 'author': 'Robert H. Brown', 'doc': 'AMINO ACID DATING\\nbyR. H. BrownGeoscience Research Institute\\nABSTRACT \\nInvestigation of amino acids in fossils over the past thirty years has revealed that residual amino acids may exist in fossils from throughout the Phanerozoic portion of the geologic column, that the amino acid pattern in a given fossil changes with age due to differences in stability among the twenty amino acids of which proteins are constructed, and that the ratio of right-handed to left-handed forms (D/L ratio) of amino acids increases with age from zero in the proteins of living organisms to the ratios which are characteristic of amino acids produced synthetically (the racemic ratios).\\nThe possibilities for using these characteristics as a means for determining fossil age are frustrated by variations of the amino acid pattern among individual living organisms of the same species, and by the critical dependency of the racemization probability for an amino acid molecule on temperature, water concentration in the environment, alkalinity of the environment, association with other molecules (free state or a component of a macromolecule), size of the macromolecule of which it may be a component, specific location in the structure of a macromolecule, catalytic effect of clay surfaces with which it may be associated, presence of aldehydes and metal ions, concentration of buffer compounds in the environment, and ionic strength of the environment. In spite of these complications, fossils of similar characteristics, and which have experienced similar conditions of preservation, can be placed in a relative age sequence on the basis of D/L ratios. Due to the strong dependency of racemization rates on temperature, water concentration, and alkalinity, uncertainties regarding conditions of preservation can leave amino-acid-based age relationships among even similar fossils open to question. At the present time there is insufficient knowledge concerning the effective average racemization rate in a fossil as a function of time to justify dependence on D/L ratios for a quantitative determination of age.\\nThe survival of amino acids in fossils from the Paleozoic era and the trend for the apparent racemization rate constant to decrease with conventional fossil age assignment raise a serious question concerning the accuracy with which radioisotope age data have been used to represent the real-time history of fossils.\\nThe instability of the twenty amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins provides a possible means for determining the ages of fossils. A preliminary recognition of this possibility appeared in the scientific literature 30 years ago (Abelson 1955).\\nAMINO ACID SURVIVAL IN PHANEROZOIC FOSSILS\\nSince amino acids have widely varying degrees of stability, after the death of an organism the less stable amino acid components will decompose more rapidly than those which are more stable, producing an amino acid signature that is increasingly distributed toward the more stable components as time progresses (Hare and Abelson 1967, Lee et al. 1976, Akiyama and Wyckoff 1970). Because of the range of variation among individual members of the same species (Hare and Abelson 1965, Hare and Mitterer 1967, King and Hare 1972, Jope 1980), amino acids may be expected to provide at best only a broad indication of fossil age. Uncertainty as to the extent to which modern organisms represent in detail the characteristics of their ancient counterparts introduces additional lack of precision in a fossil age based on amino acid ratios.\\n). Therefore it has been suggested that the amino acids found in older fossils, such as those from Cambrian sediments, e.g., are recent contaminants rather than actual molecules remaining from the original organisms. Investigation of this suggestion has identified residual amino acids in Silurian graptolites (400-430 million year putative age) (Florkin 1969). It has been well established that shells as old as Jurassic (135-180 million year conventional age) may contain amino acids bound as protein and peptide, and hence residuals from the parent organisms (Akiyama and Wyckoff 1970). An attempt to account for these apparently anomalous observations has been made by suggesting that the fossil matrix somehow holds the amino acid molecules together so that they do not spontaneously decompose as would be expected on the basis of their binding energies (i.e., structural strength) (Hare and Mitterer 1968).\\nCHANGE OF D/L RATIO WITH TIME\\nA far more suitable approach to fossil age determination is provided by the fact that all but one (glycine) of the amino acids in proteins are asymmetric and may exist in either a left-handed (L) or a right-handed (D) form, each of which is the mirror image of the other. As an example, Figure1 illustrates the L- and D-forms of aspartic acid. L- and D-forms have opposite rotational effects on the vibrational plane of polarized light. All other physical properties of the L- and D-forms of a given amino acid are identical, and of course the chemical compositions are identical. Small amounts of D-amino acids are found in organisms, but most of the amino acids in organisms are constituents of protein molecules, and all amino acids (except glycine which is symmetric and has no D- and L-configuration) in the protein of living organisms are in the L-configuration (Kvenvolden 1975).\\n\\nFIGURE 1. Structural Representation of Aspartic Acid Enantiomers.\\n\\nBoth the D- and the L-configurations of amino acids convert to the other over a period of time, either as the result of random thermal energy or through a catalyzed chemical mechanism. After the death of an organism the L-amino acids diminish while the D-forms accumulate until equilibrium conditions are reached. In the case of any amino acid containing a single asymmetric carbon atom, such as aspartic acid, the equilibrium state is 50% L- and 50% D-, a 1/1 ratio. After equilibrium is reached the conversion from D-to L- is just as rapid as the conversion from L- to D-. The equilibrium state is called a racemic mixture, and the process of approaching equilibrium is called racemization.\\nFour of the amino acids that make up proteins isoleucine, threonine, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine have two asymmetric carbon atoms which produce four structural possibilities for the same chemical composition. Two of these forms are designated as diastereomers, each of which may exist in either an L- or a D-form. Figure2 illustrates this pattern for isoleucine, which together with aspartic acid has received the greatest attention in amino acid dating. Interaction among diastereomers is called epimerization. The epimerization process includes racemization. The racemic mixture resulting from the epimerization of isoleucine has been determined to have a ratio of D-alloisoleucine to L-isoleucine in the range 1.25/1 to 1.4/1, with greatest confidence in a figure near 1.25/1. For comparison of work done by different investigators 1.25/1 is accepted as a standard value (Kvenvolden 1975, Bada 1981, Wehmiller and Belknap 1982).\\n\\nFIGURE 2. Structural Representation of Isoleucine/Alloisoleucine Enantiomers.\\n\\nIn contrast with age determination by ratios among the concentrations of various amino acids, age determination by D/L ratio has the advantage of a precise reference point, zero D/L ratio in the proteins of a living organism. The laboratory procedure involves only the measurement of two components that can be determined by standard chromatograph techniques with relatively inexpensive equipment. Before we can evaluate the results of such determinations we will need a relationship between the D/L ratio and time.\\nQUANTITATIVE RELATIONSHIPS FOR RACEMIZATION RATE\\nLet the symbols D and L now represent the concentrations of the D-form and the L-form, respectively, of an interconverting enantiomer pair such as D- and L-aspartic acid, or an interconverting diastereomer pair such as D-alloisoleucine and L-isoleucine. kL will be the rate constant (probability) for conversion from the L-form to the D-form within a unit of time, and kD will be the corresponding rate constant (probability) for conversion from the D-form to the L-form. Symbolically\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\nFor the rate of change of L per unit time we can write\\n\\xa0\\n\\nwhere dL/dt is negative since the L-isomer experiences only a net decrease over time until dL/dt becomes zero at equilibrium. The integral solution of Equation (1) is (Bada and Schroeder 1972, Petit 1974)in which ln designates \"natural logarithm.\" For enantiomer pairs such as D- and L-aspartic acid which have equal concentrations of the L- and D-forms at equilibrium kL@ kD@ K. For aspartic acid Equation (2) becomes\\n\\xa0\\nFor the diastereomer pair D-alloisoleucine and L-isoleucine with kL/kD@ 1.25, Equation (2) becomes\\n\\xa0\\nkL/kD@ 1.25 comes from the consideration that at equilibrium kLL = kDD, together with the accepted value of 1.25 for D/L at equilibrium.\\nAlthough equations (3) and (4) appear complicated, they have the form of a simple straight-line relationship between two variables, as given by the type equation y = mx + b. The logarithmic term on the left corresponds to the dependent variable y, and t corresponds to the independent variable x. The coefficient of t is presumed to be a constant, corresponding to m, and Const. corresponds to b. The Const. term in equations (3) and (4) is the value of the logarithmic term for zero fossil age (t=0). Since the D-form does not exist in the amino acids of proteins in living organisms, the logarithmic term for t=0 should be zero (ln 1 = 0), which specifies a zero value for Const. A non-zero constant term may be required to adjust for a slight racemization produced during the laboratory preparation of a sample (Bada and Shou 1980). This constant might not be the same for every laboratory, or for every procedure within a given laboratory.\\nIsoleucine and alloisoleucine racemization rate constants reported in the literature are nearly always computed for Const. = 0 in Equation4 (references for Figure 4). Aspartic acid racemization rate constants are commonly computed using Const. = 0.14 in Equation 3 (e.g., Schroeder and Bada 1973, Bada 1981). Four determinations of D-aspartic acid in modern packrat pellets (Petit 1974) specified 0.00, 0.040, 0.080 and 0.12 for this constant. A t = 0 constant of 0.06 has been adopted for the racemization of glutamic acid in a mollusk shell (Kvenvolden and Blunt 1980). Since a direct determination of the t=0 constant is seldom reported in publications of D/L ratios for fossils, and since the 0.14 value commonly favored for aspartic acid yields physically unreasonable negative values of the racemization constant for all D/L ratios less than 0.070 (four such are encountered in the Dead Sea Scroll data that are included in Figure3), all racemization rate constants plotted in figures (3) and (4) have been calculated on the basis of a zero value for the t=0 constant.\\nFIGURE 3.

To the extent that Equation3 is valid, and that valid real-time values for t are available, these plots should fit straight lines with a y-intercept equal to the appropriate t=0 constant. Actually the plots indicate that there is a question concerning the validity of Equation3 (i.e., that k does not have the same value for all fossil ages) and/or a question concerning the real-time significance of the assigned fossil ages, particularly those in excess of 15,000 years. Of the ten data sets which have a suitable spread of fossil age for a graphical determination of the t=0 constant, seven are adequately described by a value of approximately zero, one requires a value in the range 0.6-0.9, one in the range 0-0.28, and one in the range 0.04-0.19. Use of a value other than zero for Const. in Equation 3 would lower the k values plotted in Figure3, increasingly as fossil age is reduced, and most conspicuously for fossil ages in the range below about 10,000 years; but would not alter the general conclusions to be discussed in the remainder of this paper.\\nRacemization rate constants cannot be determined theoretically, but must be calculated empirically from D/L ratio measurements made at two different times. Since racemization rate constants are so small under normal environmental circumstances, racemization may be accelerated by subjecting the sample to an interval of heating in a laboratory, with extrapolation from the rapid racemization and epimerization that occurs at elevated temperature to the much lower rate characteristic of the normal environment. An example of this temperature dependency is given by Equation (5) which specifies the racemization rate constant for isoleucine in foraminifera shell, expressed as chance per molecule per year in terms of T in degrees Celsius (Centigrade) (Bada and Schroeder 1972, Wehmiller et al. 1976).\\n\\xa0\\nAccording to this relationship a one-degree increase in temperature at 23ºC produces nearly 16% increase in the racemization rate.\\nIn some cases rate constants extrapolated from high temperature racemization in the laboratory have produced an age estimate in satisfactory agreement with the accepted geochronologic age of a fossil (e.g., Hare and Mitterer 1968), but more often racemization rates based on laboratory or recent historical data yield fossil ages much less than the accepted geochronologic age. For example, amino acids with D/L ratios less than 1.00 have been found in Green River Formation (Wyoming) oil shale (Kvenvolden 1975). All amino acids from the organic material that produced the oil in this shale should have become racemic long before the 40-60 million years specified by the Eocene age of this formation. The apparent implication is that either the geochronologic age is incorrect or the samples were contaminated by recent organic material. Some fossil shells of Miocene age (10-25 million geochronologic years) have been reported to contain amino acids with a D/L ratio nearly equal to unity (Hare and Abelson 1967).\\nSUMMARY OF RACEMIZATION RATES IN RELATION TO FOSSIL AGE\\nRacemization rate constants for aspartic acid and for isoleucine, derived by equations(3) and (4) with zero t=0 constant, from D/L ratio and associated fossil age data that have been published in the readily accessible literature, are plotted in figures(3) and (4). The four magnitude (104) range of data for both rate constant and age require a logarithmic scale on each axis. These data include mollusk shells, foraminifera shells, foraminifera ooze, coral, bones, wood, and parchment (Dead Sea Scrolls). With a few exceptions among ages in the less than 6000 years range, the age assignments are based on radiosotope data, either carbon-14 or disequilibrium of uranium daughter products. The specimens represented in figures (3) and (4) were obtained from a wide range of arctic, desert, temperate, and ocean floor environments. Some of them may have inconsistent age assignments.\\nThe most impressive immediate impact of these plots is that for a particular amino acid there is no characteristic racemization rate constant that can be used to estimate the age of every fossil containing that amino acid. If each amino acid could be described by a characteristic racemization rate constant as a component of fossil protein, the data points in figures(3) and (4) would cluster about a horizontal line. The demonstrated clustering about a line which slopes downward indicates that the apparent racemization rate constant is actually not a constant, but is related to fossil age, diminishing as age increases. This observation has been made frequently in the literature (e.g., Lajoie et al. 1980, Bada and Schroeder 1972, King and Hare 1972, Wehmiller and Hare 1971, Hare and Mitterer 1966).\\nGiven the sensitivity of racemization rate to temperature, could the general trend in figures (3) and (4) indicate that the older a fossil the lower the average storage temperature it has experienced? That is, do these data indicate that the mean temperature of the environment has been increasing over the time span covered by non-racemic D/L ratios? The isoleucine racemization rate in Figure4 ranges from about 4×10-5 yr-1 to about 0.025×10-5 yr-1, or about 160-fold, between fossil ages 3000 and 2,000,000 years. Using 7ºC as a mean annual temperature for modern times, Equation (5) specifies an effective average storage temperature of -19ºC for a 160-fold reduction. Due to the exponential dependency of racemization rate on temperature, the mean temperature during a large portion of the storage time would have to be lower than -19ºC to establish a -19ºC effective average between +7ºC and the beginning of storage. For 17ºC, rather than 7ºC, as a mean annual modern temperature, the corresponding effective average storage temperature would be -11ºC. These simplified estimates fully establish that the pattern of figures (3) and (4) cannot be explained on the basis of lower temperature on land and on the ocean floor in the past (Miller and Hare 1980, p. 431). Other factors that may account for the pattern of figures (3) and (4) will be considered subsequently.\\nIt has been asserted that amino acid age dating corroborates radiocarbon ages and age assignments based on disequilibrium of uranium decay products (e.g., King and Hare 1972, Bada and Deems 1975, Blake 1980). The basis for such claims may be illustrated from Figure4. In Figure4 a racemization rate constant in the vicinity of 0.2×10-5 yr-1 is associated with samples of assigned age ranging from about 10,000 years to about 700,000 years. Accordingly it is evident that a set of specimens can be obtained, or fortuitously acquired, for which a racemization rate constant derived from the D/L ratio in any one will predict the \"correct\" age when applied to any other member of the set. On the other hand, within the 10,000-700,000 year age range on Figure4 one can select a sample set each of which has an assigned age of 80,000 years but has a racemization rate constant in the range between about 0.06×10-5 yr-1 and 2.0×10-5 yr-1. For the Dead Sea Scrolls aspartic acid data set plotted in Figure3 some samples located within one centimeter of each other on the same piece of parchment have D/L ratios that differ by factors of 1.7× to 3.9× (racemization rate constant ratios 1.8× to 4.0× ) (Weiner et al. 1980).\\nWith this simplified introduction to a highly complex topic one can appreciate the following comments from a paper presented at the 1978 conference on Advances in Biogeochemistry of Amino Acids (Miller and Hare 1980, pp. 416, 439): \"... racemization \\'dates\\' should probably be regarded only as preliminary estimates unless corroborated by other independent criteria\"; \"Extrapolation based on 14C dated samples to older samples must be considered tenuous....\"\\nFACTORS AFFECTING RACEMIZATION RATE\\nFrom Figures (3) and (4) it is apparent that for any specific amino acid there is not one characteristic racemization rate constant that is appropriate for all ordinary circumstances at all times, as is the case for radioisotope dating. The racemization rate of an amino acid has been determined to be dependent on the following factors (Smith and Evans 1980, Kriausakul and Mitterer 1980a, 1980b).\\n\\nTemperature\\nWater concentration in the environment\\npH (acidity/alkalinity) in the environment\\nBound state versus free state\\nSize of the macromolecule, if in a bound state\\nSpecific location in the macromolecule, if in a bound state\\nContact with clay surfaces (catalytic effect)\\nPresence of aldehydes, particularly when associated with metal ions\\nConcentration of buffer compounds\\nIonic strength of the environment\\n\\nAnother complicating factor that may be encountered in the dating of bone and sediment without isolation of the bound amino acids from the free amino acids is the D-amino acid, particularly alanine, which may be produced by bacteria (Pollock and Kvenvolden 1978, Kessels and Dugworth 1980). This complication can be avoided by restricting analysis to amino acids or amino acid components which are unlikely to have been affected by bacteria, or to samples which do not contain excess amounts of the amino acids that are characteristic of bacterial activity.\\nIt is apparent that any D/L ratio in a fossil represents both the age of the fossil and the environmental circumstances under which it has been preserved. If the significant environmental factors can be specified with certainty throughout the entire history of the fossil, the real-time age of the fossil can be derived from a D/L ratio and a corresponding racemization rate constant that has been determined for an equivalent environment. If the age is known, the rate constant derived from a D/L measurement might provide a significant intimation concerning the past environment, e.g., paleotemperature (Bada et al. 1973, Schroeder and Bada 1973, Bender 1974, Mitterer 1975, Wehmiller 1977).\\nIn consideration of the ten factors listed above, it is evident that equations (3) and (4) yield an effective average k that represents the combination of a large number of specific rate constants that have been descriptive of various individual amino acid molecules at different times throughout the history of a specimen. On the basis of this insight one can expect that during the early history of a fossil D-amino acids will accumulate relatively rapidly from L-molecules that may be described by a relatively high value of k, and that as time progresses accumulation will be increasingly limited to L-molecules associated with lower values of k. Such a model is the favored explanation for the pattern displayed in figures (3) and (4).\\nIn relation to this model an investigation of the D-alloisoleucine/L-isoleucine ratio as a function of molecule size in protein from a Late Pleistocene Mercenaria shell (putative age in the 10-300 thousand year range) yielded the data in Table1 (Kriausakul and Mitterer 1980a). On the basis of the D/L ratio for the total shell, from Figure4 this shell could be assigned an age anywhere in the range between about 30,000 years and about 2,000,000 years. The maximum ratio of logarithms from column 3 is 53/1 (<500 fraction free, to 1000-10,000 fraction total). Whatever the age of this shell, the racemization rate constants would have a corresponding ratio of 53/1. The highest ratio at any age in Figure4 is 30/1 at 80,000 years. The ratio to be accounted for over the total range of fossil age in Figure4 is about 2000/1. Since the observed range of variation in k at any particular fossil age is much less, and over the total range of fossil age is much greater, than the range allowed by the available data on racemization rate as a function of protein molecule size, explanation of the pattern displayed in figures (3) and (4) in terms of a progressive decline in the effective average value of k is at least questionable.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTABLE 1. Racemization (Epimerization) in a Fossil Mercenaria Shell as a Function of Protein Molecule Size. Whole shell and molecular weight fraction 500 contain free amino acids, in addition to amino acids bound in protein molecules.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAs an alternative to the model based on D-amino acid accumulation becoming increasingly limited to L-molecules initially associated with lower k, one could propose that as a fossil ages the breakdown of proteins continually renews the supply of L-molecules in locations with the higher values of k. If such were the case, the effective average value of k for the sample could be more nearly constant, rather than changing 2000-fold, as suggested by Figure4, or 700-fold, as suggested by Figure3. It is significant that temperature, water concentration, and alkalinity to which the racemization rate in a fossil is particularly sensitive are also factors which are particularly conducive to the breakdown of larger protein molecules to smaller components. Before conclusions may be drawn with confidence concerning change of the average racemization rate with time we should have studies such as that represented in Table 1 for each of several samples with well-determined fossil age assignments ranging from 5000 years to 1,000,000 years.\\nVALIDITY OF FOSSIL AGE ASSIGNMENTS\\nIn a discussion of disagreement between fossil age as projected from amino acid D/L data and as based on radioisotope data, Bender (1974) has said \"The differences [re 14C age] can be reconciled if it is assumed that the 14C age [of the sample under discussion] is wrong, but such an assertion would undermine other conclusions.\" With similar reasoning the progressive decline of racemization constants in figures (3) and (4) might be taken as an indication that the fossil age assignments are progressively excessive. This possibility is clearly indicated if the average probability for conversion of L-amino acids to the D-form in a sample actually remains roughly the same from century to century. Many difficulties would be resolved, and much anomalous data would be reconciled if fossil ages were adjusted to make the data points in figures (3) and (4) scatter about a horizontal line, rather than a line sloping downwards. While the data discussed in this paper provide an adequate scientific basis for such an adjustment, the extent to which it \"would undermine other conclusions\" is a price very few members of the scientific community would be willing to pay. The course of preference is to assign the apparent inverse relationship between effective average racemization rate constant and fossil age to some time-dependent factor that is not yet fully understood.\\nTo make the data points in figures (3) and (4) scatter about a horizontal line would require the reassignment of fossil ages approximately as indicated in Table2. The rough estimates given in Table2 are presented here for their possible interest, without any claim as to their significance. A more sophisticated data analysis would be required before such claims should be made.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nTABLE 2. Approximate Fossil Age Reassignments Required to Produce Uniform Racemization Rate Constants (see text).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThirty years of investigation into the potential for using amino acid data as indicators of fossil age has demonstrated that fossils of similar characteristics and which have experienced similar conditions of preservation can be placed in a relative age sequence on the basis of D/L ratios. Due to the strong dependency of racemization rates on temperature, water concentration, and alkalinity, uncertainties regarding conditions of preservation can leave age relationships among even similar fossils open to question. When age relationships can be established on a firm independent basis, in some cases D/L ratios can be a guide to paleotemperature.\\nAt the present time there is insufficient knowledge concerning the effective average racemization rate in a sample as a function of time to justify dependence on D/L ratios for a quantitative determination of fossil age. The present status of amino acid dating can be summarized by the conclusion from the 19th International Symposium on Archeometry and Archaeological Prospection that \"the time when [amino acid racemization] can provide a problem-free dating service is still some way off\" (Hedges 1979). The literature since 1979 indicates an increasing awareness of the uncertainties in using amino acid D/L ratios as indicators of age.\\nIn addition to the wide range of fossil age associated with a given value of a racemization rate constant and the wide range of racemization rate constant associated with a given fossil age, there is a dominant trend for the effective racemization rate constant to decrease with putative fossil age. This relationship, together with the demonstrated survival of amino acids in fossils from the Paleozoic era, raises a question concerning the accuracy with which radioisotope age data have been used to represent the real-time history of fossils.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\\nI am deeply indebted to reviewers of this paper for suggestions that have contributed to readability for the general reader and rigor for the specialist. To these reviewers, and also all readers, I must express my regret at not having the skill or patience to meet these goals more fully.\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nAbelson, Philip H. 1955. Paleobiochemistry.

Brown', 'doc': 'HOW SOLID IS A RADIOISOTOPE AGE OF A ROCK?\\nbyR. H. BrownGeoscience Research Institute\\nGENERAL SCIENCE NOTE\\n).\\nTo be suitable for geologic time scale calibration a radioisotope age must meet three requirements: chemical isolation, stratigraphic control, and biological control. To meet the requirement of chemical isolation there must be no indication that either radioactive parent atoms or daughter type atoms have been transferred into or out of the mineral during the indicated time period. Diffusion due to heat, and solution or deposition due to contact with water can violate the chemical isolation requirement. Stratigraphic control requires that the mineral sample come from a clearly defined geologic formation which has an expected age range that is consistent with the radioisotope age of the sample. For example, a radioisotope age of either 100 million years (m.y.) or 3000 m.y. would not be accepted as the \"true\" real time age of a rock obtained from a geologic formation that is unquestioningly of Cambrian classification, regardless of how precise and accurate the isotope determinations may be. To be desirable as a calibration of the Phanerozoic time scale, a radioisotope age should also meet standards of biological control, i.e., it should relate to a mineral sample that is associated with the proper index fossils for the age in question. While biological control and stratigraphic control are interrelated, applying each explicitly makes a more stringent requirement. The reader who is interested in the stance of the professional literature on these criteria should consult W. B. Harland et al. (1964), George V. Cohee et al. (1978), and Giles S. Odin (1982).\\nLack of chemical isolation generally (but not always) has been expected to produce radioisotope ages that are most likely to be younger than the correct real time age, particularly when the daughter isotope is highly mobile, as is the case for the inert gas (argon) produced by the radioactive decay of potassium. Radioisotope ages that are younger than what would be expected on the basis of stratigraphic control and biological control are usually accounted for as evidence that chemical isolation has not been maintained.\\nRadioisotope ages that are older than allowable on the basis of stratigraphic or biological control are explained as due to retention of daughter isotopes from a state in which the mineral components existed previous to the association in which they are now found. Brooks et al. (1976) list 22 examples of rubidium-strontium (Rb-Sr) ages ranging from 70 million to 3300 m.y. which are stratigraphically constrained to represent volcanic activity within the last 65 m.y. (late Flood and/or post-Flood volcanic activity, according to conservative Biblical creationist interpretations of geology). Five continents are represented in this set of examples. Othman et al. (1984) have recently reported an extensive study of 32 typical worldwide granulite samples that have geologic age assignments ranging from 20 to 3100 m.y., yet have samarium-neodymium (Sm-Nd) radioisotope ages that in most cases are greater than the geologic ages and range from 851 to 3744 m.y. Rb-Sr ages for this sample set range from 596 to 3650 m.y. Allègre and Rousseau (1984) report Sm-Nd ages ranging from 1870 to 3780 m.y. for a set of seven Australian shale samples that have geologic age assignments ranging from 200 to greater than 3300 m.y.\\nIn contrast with the earlier perception that potassium-argon (K-Ar) ages for glauconites are probably less than the formation age, it has now been established that K-Ar ages for a glauconite should be considered suspect as too old, due to possible incorporation of radiogenic argon along with potassium at the time of glauconite formation (Odin and Dodson 1982). Volcanics associated with organic material that can be dated by radioactive carbon generally have a K-Ar age much greater than that given by radiocarbon for the eruption (Stapor and Tanner 1973). A prime example is the 485,000 K-Ar age for volcanics from a Mt. Rangitoto eruption which destroyed trees less than 300  C-14 years old (McDougall et al. 1969).\\nThe brief review reported in this article should make it apparent that while techniques for the determination of radioisotope age are precise and accurate, the interpretation of a radioisotope age in terms of real time is subjective and will reflect the biases of the interpreter. For illustration, consider the 12.3 to 519 m.y. K-Ar ages obtained for glauconitized coprolites from the Gulf of Guinea (see Odin and Dodson 1982, p. 286). A 12.3 million year age for a mineral presumed to have formed 500 m.y. ago could be explained as the consequence of argon loss caused by heating in a recent portion of the presumed 500 m.y. existence of the specimen. The 12.3 m.y. age also could be explained on the basis of radiogenic argon incorporation together with potassium in a crystallization that occurred only 4000 years ago. And the 12.3 m.y. could be considered to be a \"correct\" indication of the time this glauconite has been in existence (Odin and Dodson only presume that these coprolites formed \"less than 100,000 years ago\"). Each of these interpretations is equally valid scientifically until measured against definitive evidence to the contrary. One\\'s theoretical biases will determine what he allows as definitive evidence, and how he treats this evidence. Returning to the title for this review, it can be said that the real time interpretation of a radioisotope age for a rock is no more solid than the theoretical perspective of the interpreter.\\nREFERENCES \\n\\nAllègre, Claude J. and Dominique Rousseau. 1984.

Barnett', 'doc': \"YOUNG'S OLD EARTH\\nBook Review by Stephen F. Barnett, Division of Natural Sciences, Bryan College, Dayton, Tennessee\\nCHRISTIANITY AND THE AGE OF THE EARTH. Davis A. Young. 1982. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House. 188 p.\\nDavis A. Young is both a practicing geologist and a theologically conservative, evangelical Christian. He is acutely distressed at the credence given to “recent creationism” by so many within the evangelical community. Christianity and the Age of the Earth appeals to those Christians to reject recent creationism as a view neither mandated by Scripture nor supported by science.\\nIn the first of the book’s three major “considerations” bearing on the age of the earth, Young traces the development of an ancient earth concept in the theological and geological communities. The predominant view from the time of the early Church until about the 18th century, says Young, was a literal acceptance of creation in 24-hour days within the past few thousand years. Early geologists thus tended to interpret evidences from stratigraphy and paleontology in light of the Genesis flood account. However, many observations in those and other areas, such as geomorphology and geochemistry, seemed to indicate processes requiring longer than the few thousand years allowed by a traditional view of Genesis. By the latter half of the 19th century most geologists, many of whom were Christians affirming the validity of the Genesis narrative, adopted a much longer chronology for earth history and viewed the flood as a minor element in earth history.\\nThe changing consensus among geologists prompted theologians to examine Genesis anew. They began to develop exegeses that were believed to be consistent with both the internal evidence of the Scriptures and with the accumulating evidence from geology. This “age of harmonization” (p 55), as Young terms it, lasted well into the 20th century until “reactionary developments” (p 65) led to a resurgence in flood geology. Price, Nelson, Clark, and Rehwinkel were the early proponents (1920-1950s), but the strength of the movement is attributed primarily to Whitcomb and Morris’ The Genesis Flood and to the Institute for Creation Research, the Creation Research Society, and like organizations.\\nThe resurgence in flood geology is a mistake, says Young, predicated by the faulty reasoning that an ancient earth is part and parcel with evolutionary humanism; the issues are separate and “while evolution falls if the antiquity of the Earth falls it does not necessarily stand if the antiquity of the Earth stands’’ (p 66). In fact, Young continues, the ancient Earth view was developed by Christians who affirmed both creation and the flood but who were forced by the facts to recognize the antiquity of our planet.\\nIn his second consideration, the scientific evidences against creationism and favoring long ages are presented. In support of his contention that the flood geology of recent creationists is ill-founded, Young cites examples from many aspects of earth science such as stratigraphy, geochemistry and sedimentology. He asserts that the problems confronting flood geologists, when recognized, have been inadequately addressed. They either have attempted to answer the problem but failed, as in the case of radiometric dating, or they have merely given the illusion of solving problems through spurious proofs. He further asserts that many of the best evidences cited by creationists for catastrophic deposition of the geologic column (e.g., polystrate trees and fossil graveyards) can be explained as well, if not better, by long-age models.\\nAccording to Young, creationists have not solved the problems confronting their model and they have been similarly unsuccessful in attacking uniformitarian models. Their arguments are weak due to a basic lack of geological knowledge and improper reasoning.\\nHis third area of consideration is philosophy and apologetics. Young challenges the creationists’ claim that catastrophism alone can explain the geologic column. He insists that despite their insistence that uniformitarian thinking is ungodly and inadequate as a basis for historical geology, “creationists are really uniformitarians who have falsely interpreted the evidence of geology” (p 136).\\nThe final chapter analyzes the relationship between science and faith and between truth as revealed in nature and in Scripture. Young affirms that both natural and written revelation emanate from one God of Truth; as such there can be no conflict except in our interpretations. There will be tensions in matters of faith because we do not know all the facts nor do we interpret them aright; but tension in the matter of the antiquity of the earth is inexcusable because we have clear natural revelation that conflicts only with certain faulty exegeses of Genesis. Creationists would do well to examine both their science and their understanding of Genesis and see that this is so.\\nIt is difficult to review Christianity and the Age of the Earth with objectivity for, whatever the merits of the book, it is itself decidedly weighted in its presentation. In the preface Young states his worthwhile objective: “to examine some of the evidence of nature that relates to the age of the earth’’ (p 10); yet, the reader is not given the opportunity to evaluate that evidence for himself.\\nDiscussion of the scientific data is mostly confined to the middle third of the book, the rest being historical observation and philosophical conjectures. The data are generally accurate and referenced (with the exception of all text-figures), but the presentation is not impartial. To begin with, the tenor of the text clearly disparages both the belief of recent creationists and their persons as well. For instance, creationists are labeled as “the equivalent of Miller’s ‘anti-geologists’’’ (p 14), and those who hold to flood geology are generally “Christians who are not engaged in scientific endeavors” (p. 64) or who “have looked only at those rocks” favoring their a priori beliefs whereas “geologists have looked at all the rocks’’ (p 148).\\nThe presentation of the creationist’s case seems slanted also. Time after time Young cites Whitcomb & Morris’ The Genesis Flood, a book 22 years old, to show the weaknesses of flood geology. For example, in the case of fossil reefs, he reproves Whitcomb & Morris for not explaining how reef-like blocks of limestone could be deposited over fine-grained sediments. Their view is “totally unsupportable’’ and the “only realistic interpretation of the evidence is to say that the reef structures grew in place on an ancient sea floor” (p 85). But, although Young refers to a 1975 article by Nevins claiming that some so-called reefs were not true reefs at all, Young does not address Nevins’ data; he just shows that Whitcomb & Morris’ model for reef emplacement is ill-supported.\\nAgain, his chapter on radiometric dating records only weak creationist arguments for a short chronology, but in another chapter he notes in passing that Gentry has done work with serious implications for radiometric dating (p 151). The nature of that data or why it “is indeed problematic” for standard dating methods is neglected. If only the facts provided by Young are considered his conclusions seem well supported, yet one feels that there is probably more to be said for the flood model than Young has presented.\\nAnother difficulty is Young’s occasional use of interpretation in the place of data. For instance, he refers to “varves” rather than laminated couplets (p 90), to the “obvious terrestrial derivation” of some rocks (p 79), and to claims that certain cross-bedded sandstones from the Colorado Plateau could not be flood deposits because these “ancient desert sand stone[s]” (p 91) required a very long and dry period for their deposition. There may be sound reason for these interpretations, but they are not facts. Regarding, for instance, the so-called ancient desert sandstones, there is strong disagreement among uniformitarian geologists (e.g., Marzolf 1969, Freeman 1976) as to their depositional environment, and Young should so inform his readers. Picard (1977), for example, disagrees with some of the alternate depositional environments proposed for the Navajo Sandstone, but, unlike Young, he makes clear that his preference for eolian deposition is an interpretation, not a fact.\\nIf Young may be faulted for providing a polemic rather than the even handed evaluation anticipated, his book may not, on that account, be lightly dismissed. To begin with, Young is somewhat unique among geologists holding an ancient-Earth view in that he also holds a very high view of Scripture. “The Bible is true, it is infallible, it is without error no matter what our theories of geology may be” (p 151). Furthermore, he is a practicing geologist who has published in his discipline and has also addressed, in print, the difficult issue of the relation between geology and the Genesis narrative (Young 1977). Young therefore represents an informed, Christian viewpoint that merits consideration.\\nThe problems presented in Christianity and the Age of the Earth are real problems that have yet to be resolved with great satisfaction. Some are less serious than Young believes, others are indeed problematic, but none may be ignored. His perceptions merit attention and response.\\nREFERENCES \\nFreeman WE. 1976.

The material on geo and cosmic chronology is presented in brief outline form and is supplemented by an extensive bibliography. In the narrative portion, the author discusses the various evidences for a 4.5 billion-year-old universe and lists the different methods used to develop this date. Twenty-four different methods for dating and their conclusions are briefly listed. It is hoped that the readers of Origins will find this format useful as a reference tool for their own research. The Editors invite your suggestions to assist us in determining other areas that should be considered. \\nScientific creationism that is neutral with respect to religious issues has no need to defend a particular viewpoint regarding time. Proceeding only on the basis of inductive logic, it is free to pursue any interpretation that may seem to be suggested by available data. The data related to chemical evolution probabilities, thermodynamic considerations, spontaneous origin of life, genetics, and paleontology lead naturally to the conclusion that life and the life support system are products of intelligent design and creative ability. But at present there are no data that independently suggest inductively either a 6-day creation week or placement of such an event within the last 8000 years.\\nIn contrast with neutral scientific creationism, apologetic scientific creationism utilizes deductive logic in an effort to relate satisfactorily available scientific data to viewpoints derived from religious sources. Some individuals would insist that only neutral scientific creationism is truly \"scientific.\" However, apologetic scientific creationism can be defended as truly \"scientific\" to the extent that it does not go beyond sound principles of logic, data collection, and data evaluation. Efforts to explain data concerning the natural world within the constraints of the first eleven chapters of Genesis, if carried out in a sound scientific manner, would be classified as apologetic scientific creationism.\\nIn certain areas apologetic scientific creationism may have an advantage over neutral scientific creationism and non-theistic science in that it operates from a larger data base and may develop scientifically sound interpretive models that would not have been accessible by pure inductive logic. This advantage is illustrated by a comparison between a reconstruction of an event based on both the testimony of a reliable eyewitness and analysis of the consequences, and a reconstruction based on only analysis of the consequences. These two reconstructions may be evaluated on the basis of which one provides a better account of the available after-the-event data.\\nOn the basis of the principle that truth is consistent, irrespective of the means by which it is apprehended, one can say that when rightly understood, natural science and authentic historical or religious source material agree, each complementing and supplementing the other. Accordingly, apologetic scientific creationism can be an instrument for arriving at a more correct understanding of specifications obtained from a religious source, as well as of data obtained from investigation in the natural sciences.\\nIt may be appropriate to digress at this point and state my conviction that in a pluralistic society such as the United States only neutral scientific creationism is appropriate for inclusion in public school science curricula. A limited amount of apologetic scientific creationism would be appropriate in a public school sociology course that aims to acquaint the student with the various streams of thought in modern culture.\\nGeo and cosmic chronology are major concerns of creationist literature, usually from an apologetic viewpoint. The major purpose of this essay is to provide the reader with convenient access to the principal areas of evidence that must be taken into account by any scientific treatment of geo and cosmic chronology. For each of these areas I have endeavored to provide an introduction to the pertinent literature. Limitations of time and interest have prevented me from providing an adequate bibliography for some of the areas that are included in this outline.\\nRadiation Cooling of the Earth (1)\\nSerious attempts to determine the scale of geochronology on a scientific basis began in 1862 when William Thomson, who later became Lord Kelvin, estimated that planet Earth could have cooled from a molten state to its present temperature configuration within between 400 and 20 million years (m.y.). This constraint was an irritation to Charles Darwin who sensed that it did not provide sufficient time for his model of biologic evolution. By 1897 Lord Kelvin had narrowed the range of uncertainty in his estimate to between 40 and 20 m.y. By including the contribution of heat presumed to be available from radioactive material, the geophysicist, Arthur Holmes was able in 1947 to extend this estimate of cooling time to between 2 and 4 billion years (b.y.).\\nMineral Content of Seawater (2)\\nThe astronomer Edmund Halley suggested in 1715 that planet Earth might be \"much older than many have hitherto imagined,\" and proposed that the salinity of the ocean might provide a basis for an estimate of its minimum age. By 1898 sufficient information on the rates at which the major rivers carry salt into the ocean  became available to permit John Joly to estimate that the present salinity of the ocean could be attained within 80 to 90 m.y. In the early 1940s this estimate was reexamined and extended to between 150 and 250 m.y. on the basis of processes by which salt is now known to be recycled from the sea back to the land. By postulating slower input from rivers in the ancient past, Arthur Holmes was finally able to suggest an age of the Earth between 1 and 7 b.y. on the basis of ocean salinity.\\nEarth-Moon Separation (3)\\nAs the principles of celestial mechanics were developed it became evident that tidal friction causes both Earth and Moon to slow down in their rotations until they each maintain the same face toward the other (no further tidal energy dissipation). During this process the separation between them gradually increases as required to conserve angular momentum. On the basis of his study of tides throughout the world Lord Kelvin came to the conclusion that the Earth-Moon system had been in existence less than a billion years. G. H. Darwin estimated that the present Earth-Moon separation has been achieved in 57 m.y. More recent calculations indicate that, beginning with close proximity to Earth, the Moon would reach its present separation distance in between 1 and 4 b.y.\\nDenudation of Igneous Rocks (4)\\nThe previously mentioned early efforts to obtain an age estimate for planet Earth are significant only for their historical interest. They depend on highly uncertain initial assumptions concerning a molten state of the planet, a fresh-water ocean, and a tightly bound Earth-Moon system. Another interesting attempt to obtain an age for the Earth is based on the assumption that all sedimentary rocks have been produced by erosion of igneous rocks, at present rates. The uncertainties in these rates and in the volume of sediments involved lead to estimates in the range between approximately 400 million and 3 billion years.\\nComet Frequency (5)\\nThe existence of comets has been taken to indicate that the Solar System has not been in existence longer than a few million years. This conclusion comes from recognition that because of evaporation, radiation pressure, and solar wind effects very few comets survive as many as ten trips around the Sun. Since there is only speculation concerning the manner in which the Solar System has acquired cometary material, and there is absolutely no data with respect to the inventory of this material at any time, one should not expect the frequency with which comets appear to give a reliable indication of the scale for Solar System chronology.\\nCosmic Dust Density (6)\\nThere is sufficient cosmic dust in interplanetary space to produce the phenomenon known as Zodiacal Light. In the order of 10-100 thousand tons of this dust are captured by Earth each year. Since this dust is constantly swept up by the planets, driven out of the Solar System by radiation pressure, and pulled into the Sun as a result of the Poynting-Robertson effect, its present existence has been taken as evidence that the Solar System has been in existence no longer than approximately 2 b.y. It can be shown that all particles smaller than one centimeter in diameter would be removed from the space between Earth and the Sun within 10 m.y. The credibility of maximum Solar System age estimates based on the density of cosmic dust suffers from our ignorance concerning the distribution of this material in the past, and particularly from our ignorance concerning the amount of such material that may be swept up as the Solar System moves through its galaxy.\\nSynchronous Orbits of Satellites (7)\\nThe Moon is in a synchronous orbit, i.e., it makes precisely one rotation on its axis for each revolution about the Earth, with the result that it always shows the same face toward Earth. Any elastic object orbiting in a force field that causes deformation will approach a synchronous orbit due to conversion of rotational energy into heat by internal friction. The synchronous orbit of the Moon may be taken as evidence that the Earth-Moon system has been in existence for many hundreds of millions of years, presuming the Moon was once rotating more rapidly than at present.\\nAll planetary satellites that have been adequately observed (telescopic observation of Jupiter and Saturn, space probe observation of Mars, direct observation of the Moon) are in a synchronous orbit. Most of these satellites are marked by craters from meteoroid impacts that would have changed the rotation rate of these satellites. Calculations have been made of the amount of time that would be required for the Martian satellites to reach a synchronous orbit after the last significant perturbation by meteoroid impact. The greater the orbit radius the weaker the tidal forces will be, and the longer the time required to achieve a synchronous orbit. For the outermost satellite of Mars, Deimos, the estimated minimum synchronization time is 3 m.y. if the structure is compacted sand, and 100 m.y. if it is solid basalt.\\nSynchronous Orbits of Planets (8)\\nThe planets experience tidal forces that reduce their motions to synchronous orbits with respect to the Sun. The motion of Venus is within -8% of perfect synchronism (retrograde spin with -243/225 spin/orbit periods in Earth days). Mercury has a commensurate orbit with a spin/orbit period ratio of 2/3 (58.6/88 in Earth days). A spin/orbit period coupling of 2/3 is a resonant state that is stable and is a special case of synchronous orbits. A mass distribution of Mercury and/or the Sun that does not have perfect spherical symmetry (dipole and higher terms in the gravitational field) could prevent a transition of the spin/orbit ratio from the 2/3 state to the 1/1 state.\\nMore amazing is the discovery that Venus is in a synchronous relationship with respect to Earth. Venus turns the same face to Earth at each inferior conjunction. The most reasonable explanation of this relationship requires gravitational coupling between Earth and Venus over a time period in the magnitude of billions of years. The lack of a synchronous relationship of Earth with respect to Venus is explainable as the consequence of the diurnal cycle necessary for the maintenance of organic life and established at the beginning of the creation week described in the first chapter of Genesis. In summary, one can say that the observed characteristics of the inner planet orbits indicate that the Solar System has been in existence for a billion years, or more.\\nExtraterrestrial Erosion (9)\\nRocks on the surface of the Moon are found to be highly eroded. They are pitted, have rounded edges, and are often surrounded by a sloping bank of fine material that can be described as soil, while the buried portion may have relatively smooth surfaces bounded by sharp angular edges. The factors that produce this erosion are expansion and contraction associated with rapid extreme changes in temperature, the \"sandblasting\" effect of micrometeoroid bombardments, and sputtering produced by the solar wind.\\nFresh-looking craters with sharp edges are found superimposed on highly eroded, \"old,\" rounded-off craters, some of which are so eroded as to be scarcely discernible. In the highland areas of the Moon craters are found in a saturation distribution (further meteoroid bombardment would not produce a major change in the crater density, obliterating previous craters as rapidly as new ones are formed). But in the mare areas the crater density is only 1 /10 to 1/50 as great. The evident interpretation is that since the mare areas were filled in by lava flow they have been exposed to meteoroid impact for a much shorter time than have the highland areas. The impact crater density on the Moon cannot be accounted for within a 5 b.y. time span unless the meteoroid impact rate is assumed to have been much greater during the early history of the Solar System than it has been during recorded Earth history.\\nThe totality of this evidence leads to the conclusion that the Moon has been in existence as a solid object for a time in the order of at least one billion years.\\nSimilar features of crater distribution and erosion have been revealed in the televised pictures sent from Mercury and Mars by space probes. The erosion features seen on Mercury are probably due to the same processes that have been operating on the Moon. Mars is experiencing strong aeolean erosion at the present time. It appears to have had an episode of severe fluid erosion under climatic conditions vastly different from those that can be accounted for under present circumstances.\\nLight-Year Scale (10)\\nAstronomers have good reasons for believing that they are now observing galaxies and quasars that are tens of billions of light years distant from Earth. If the current estimation of distance for these objects is correct, the universe must have been in existence for at least tens of billions of years.\\nGalaxy Clusters (11)\\nGalaxies are known to be grouped in clusters. At the present state of our knowledge concerning the mass of matter contained within galaxies, the gravitational forces that can be expected to act between members of a cluster are not sufficient to hold the cluster together. With the individual galactic motions that have been observed, the known galactic clusters can be expected to dissolve within less than 100 b.y. On the basis of this argument some galactic clusters have been considered to be no more than 2-4 b.y. old.\\nSpiral Galaxy Structure (12)\\nThe Milky Way and its neighbor, Andromeda, belong to the Spiral Galaxy classification. It is thought that the spiral arm features of these galaxies would be obliterated after between one and three full rotations of the galaxy about its center of mass, since the angular velocity of revolution increases the closer a star is to the galactic center. On the basis of the rotation rates that have been observed, the lifetime of spiral galaxies has been estimated to be in the order of 300 m.y. Accordingly, our own galaxy would not be more than 300 m.y. old. It has been suggested that spiral arm galactic structure is not due to an initial star distribution, but rather is the result of gravity waves that cause the stars to bunch together in a cyclic manner as they revolve about the galactic center of gravity.\\nStar Clusters (13)\\nMany of the stars within galaxies are themselves grouped into clusters. It is expected that perturbing gravitational influences from nearby stars and star clusters will gradually pull these clusters apart. Detailed consideration leads to the estimate that star clusters are no more than 3-6 b.y. old.\\nBinary Stars (14)\\nWithin our own Milky Way galaxy it is possible to observe that many of the stars are gravitationally coupled in pairs that revolve about a common center of mass. It can be expected that a high proportion of binary stars is to be found only in a relatively young galaxy, for the perturbing influences of nearby stars should slowly pull the binary stars apart. On the basis of the expected mean lifetime of a binary star system our galaxy has been estimated to be less than 10 b.y. old.\\nStellar Dynamics (15)\\nWith the knowledge of thermonuclear reactions man has acquired since World War II, and with the aid of electronic computers, it is possible to predict the detailed history of a large mass of hydrogen gas that will experience nuclear fusion under gravitational confinement \\x97 i.e., calculate the history of a star. Astronomers can observe numerous stars that have the characteristics associated with each state but one in the theoretical life history of a star. The stage for which no definite example has yet been found is the extremely rapid transition (lifetime measured in months) to the White Dwarf stage.\\nIf the correspondence between real stars and the theoretically determined life history of a star is not merely fortuitous, one can confidently state that an average star such as our Sun has a life of approximately 10 b.y., provided it is maintained as an isolated system without replenishment of fuel (hydrogen). According to this model, the observed distribution of star types places the age of our galaxy, as well as the age of the universe, at not less than 10 b.y.\\nResidual Radioactivity (16)\\nThe accidental discovery of radioactivity by Henri Bequerel in 1896 initiated a series of developments that have provided man with his most precise and most reliable tools for investigating geo and cosmic chronology. The most crucial steps in this development were the discovery of spontaneous atomic transmutation by Madame Curie in 1898, and the discovery of isotopes by Sir J. J. Thomson in 1913. Instrumentation and laboratory techniques developed since World War II have made possible spectacular advances in geo and cosmic chronology.\\nAn infinitely old object would not be radioactive, for any radioactive isotopes it may have contained originally would have transformed to stable daughter isotopes. The presence of uranium in minerals from Earth, the Moon, and meteorites indicates that these components of the Solar System have been in existence less than 20 b.y. The present ratio of uranium-235 to uranium-238 further indicates that Earth and the Solar System have not been in existence longer than about 5 b.y.\\nExtinct Radioactivity (17)\\nUranium-235, which is the basis of the contemporary nuclear energy technology, is present as only 0.72 atom percent of relatively rare uranium. The half-life of uranium-235, 704 m.y., is the lowest among unsupported radioactive nuclides that are known to exist in significant quantity throughout the Solar System. The next lower half-life among the nuclide possibilities is 170 m.y. (within a factor of two) niobium-92. There is 90 percent confidence that niobium-92 has been observed at (1.2 ± 0.7) × 10-10 percent isotopic abundance in association with stable niobium-93. No evidence for natural occurrence of 100 m.y. samarium-146 has yet been found. Diligent search with the most sophisticated techniques has detected 83 m.y. plutonium-244 at approximately 10-16 weight percent in a sample of the rare earth bastnaesite. Since plutonium is chemically similar to cerium, it is most likely to be found in a high-cerium-content mineral such as bastnaesite. Search for other unsupported radioactive nuclides with half-life less than 80 m.y. has been diligent but unfruitful.\\nAll nuclides that are stable or have half-lives greater than 80 m.y. have been found in Earth, Moon and meteorite material. In Solar System material there is both fission-track and daughter-product isotope evidence for the prior existence of extinct 100 m.y. samarium-146, 83 m.y. plutonium-244, 15.9 m.y. iodine-129, 15.4 m.y. curium-247, 6.5 m.y. palladium-107 and 740,000 year aluminum-26. The conclusion from this evidence is that at least some components of Earth and other members of the Solar System have been in existence as solid objects for no less than 300 m.y. \\x97 the time for a 90 m.y. half-life nuclide to reach 1/10 of its initial concentration. Since there is good reason for expecting that in a creation of elementary matter plutonium-244 appears in the ratio of 0.013/1 with respect to uranium-238, the data on the present availability of natural plutonium-244 indicates that the matter from which the bulk of the Solar System is constructed has been in existence in the order of 5 b.y. Similar consideration regarding niobium-92 yields the same conclusion.\\nCosmogenic Radioactivity (18)\\nAtomic nuclei that have been ejected from stars and acquired immense amounts of kinetic energy are known as cosmic rays. (The relatively low energy atomic particles emitted by a star are known as \"solar wind\"). These cosmic particles have the capability to shatter atoms which they may strike. Some of the atom fragments thus produced are unstable atoms of a simpler construction than the target atom that was shattered. (Spallation is the scientific name for this process). Unstable atoms produced in this matter are described as having cosmogenic radioactivity.\\nThe half-lives of the principle cosmogenic radioactive products range from 5.7 day Mn52 to 740 thousand year Al25, 1.6 m.y. Be10, and 3.7 m.y. Mn53. Some 1.28 b.y. K40 is also produced in this manner. After exposure to a constant cosmic ray flux for a time equal to about four half-lives, a cosmogenic radioactive nuclide reaches an equilibrium concentration at which the number of new atoms formed within a given period of time is equal to the number that experience radioactive decay during the same time.\\nThe land and water surface of Earth is protected by the atmosphere from primary cosmic radiation. In meteorites and in material that has been secured from the Moon we have access to objects that contain cosmogenic radioactivity. The cosmogenic nuclides from 5.7 day Mn52 to 740 thousand year Al26 and 3.7 m.y. Mn53 found in these objects are in almost all cases in equilibrium with the present cosmic ray flux. This implies that the meteoroids and the surface of the Moon have been exposed to cosmic rays for at least 15 m.y., that the intensity of cosmic rays at present is very close to the average intensity over the past 15 m.y., and that the intensity of cosmic rays probably has not varied by more than a factor of two during this time. A short burst of radiation at some time in the recent past could adjust two cosmogenic nuclides to be in equilibrium with the present cosmic ray intensity, but it is inconceivable that as many as eleven could be simultaneously adjusted in this way.\\nCosmic Ray Exposure (19)\\nThe shattering of atoms by impact from cosmic rays produces both stable and unstable nuclides. The stable spallation products accumulate continuously as long as there is exposure to cosmic radiation. In many cases stable cosmogenic nuclides can be clearly distinguished from primordial matter. In such cases the concentration of a cosmogenic nuclide indicates the amount of exposure to cosmic radiation. The time of exposure, or cosmic ray exposure age, is readily obtained by dividing the amount of exposure by the exposure rate \\x97 the cosmic ray intensity. Within the experimental uncertainties, independent cosmic ray exposure age determinations with nuclides such as He3, Ne21, Ne22, and Ar38 are usually in agreement.\\nAs a primary cosmic ray particle passes through a solid it disrupts the crystalline arrangement along its track. In certain minerals it is possible with appropriate etching techniques to make these tracks visible in a microscope. The density of these cosmic ray tracks provides an independent measure of the total exposure to cosmic radiation, and the cosmic ray exposure age. If the mineral has not experienced heating or shock that erases damage patterns by realignment of crystal structure, the cosmic ray exposure age determined by track analysis may be expected to be in agreement with that determined by stable cosmogenic nuclide analysis.\\nCosmic ray exposure ages for meteorite and lunar material that has been studied are scattered over a range from one million to one billion years, with strong grouping at several points over this range. The range over which these exposure ages fall has been taken to indicate that at various times portions of the lunar surface have experienced turnover due to volcanic activity and meteoroid impact; and that meteorites have been formed by the breakup of larger objects at various times in the history of the Solar System.\\nRadioactive Decay Sequences (20)\\nThe possibility of using radioactive elements for determining chronology was recognized by Lord Rutherford in 1904. Substantial radiometric dating was not achieved until many years later, after techniques had been developed for quantitative analysis of isotopes. At the present time as many as ten independent techniques may be available for determining radioisotope age of a mineral specimen.\\nAmong the various radioisotope age determination techniques there is potential capability for indicating the time at which the matter of which a specimen is composed, experienced events such as nucleogenesis, solidification, heating, remelting, shock, mixing with other material, exposure to water, and exposure to high energy radiation. Because a given sample may have experienced two or more such events all the various radiometric age determinations that may be performed on it should not be expected to be in agreement. Disagreement between independent radiometric age determinations (discordance is the technical term) may be taken as an indication that the sample has a complex history, and may provide useful insight into the chronology of events that the sample has experienced.\\nThe many cases in which chemically and physically independent radiometric age determinations are in agreement (concordant) within limits of precision and accuracy indicate that radiometric dating procedures may yield physically significant results, regardless of whether there may not be a one-to-one correspondence between a specific radioisotope age and real time. Discordant ages generally have a rational explanation in terms of metamorphic events that the sample may have experienced.\\nIt is well known that a radiometric age is equivalent to the corresponding real time age if the initial conditions are specified with sufficient accuracy and precision, the associated radioactive decay constant(s) has (have) not changed essentially during the time involved, and the sample has been chemically isolated during this time. The large number of cases in which essential agreement exists between diverse radiometric age determinations can hardly be fortuitous, and indicate that samples can be obtained which meet the requirements for conversion of radiometric age into real time. All the radiometric age data that have accumulated for minerals from meteorites, the Moon and planet Earth lead to the conclusion that these portions of the Solar System have been in existence and contained solid material for 4.56 b.y. The available radiometric evidence indicates that the present crust of Earth does not contain rocks older than 3.9 b.y.\\nInherited Radiometric Age (21)\\nIf a radiometric age can be satisfactorily converted into real time there often still remains a problem in determining the nature of the event that initiated the time period. Radiometric dating techniques were developed in a climate that fostered a presumption concerning vast ages for the evolutionary development of living organisms, and that stimulated search for evidence supporting such ages. This situation gave rise to a naive, oversimplified, and unjustified assumption that radiometric \"clocks\" are set at zero in transport of mineral by igneous processes, and also in many sedimentary processes. According to this assumption a radiometric age of mineral that has replaced organic material, that has been injected into a fossiliferous stratum, or that overlies fossils gives a minimum real-time age for the association with the fossils involved. It would be both unfair and unkind to most of the individuals who have supported this assumption to describe it as \"the graveyard hoax\"; yet such description emphasizes an important consideration that is generally overlooked. Radiometric ages for the mineral components of the soil in a cemetery plot are not expected to date the burials made there.\\nThere is ample evidence that radiometric chronometer systems are often set to zero time in natural processes that transport or metamorphose minerals, as popularly assumed. It is not so well recognized that the inheritance of previously established radiometric age characteristics through metamorphic and transfer processes is also well established in the scientific literature. Situations are known in which even fission track and potassium-argon age characteristics have survived through a subaerial volcanic event. The survival may be anywhere between total and zero. A potassium-argon age of 465,000 years has been reported for volcanic material overlying trees that were buried by the eruption and have a carbon-14 age of only 225 years (McDougall et al. 1969). It has become recognized that the radioisotope characteristics of intrusive and volcanic material may be related more to the crustal material through which the magma was ejected and to the characteristics of successive zones in the magma chamber than to the time at which the transfer took place. There also is evidence that the radioisotope age characteristics of sediments may be related more to the source from which the material was derived than to the time at which sedimentation occurred. Extensive references to the literature on inherited radiometric age are appended to this paper.\\nRadiation Damage (22, 23)\\nRadioactive decay produces structural and electronic damage tracks in the host mineral. These damage tracks can be quantitatively analyzed to determine the total radiation exposure. A quantitative analysis of the amount of radioactive material available for producing the observed damage tracks readily leads to a computation of the irradiation time. The result is a radiometric age based on the evidence left by the radiogenic products, rather than on an assay of the products themselves. The evidence may be trapped excited electron states produced by alpha, beta or gamma radiation; or it may be crystal lattice dislocation produced by alpha particles, recoil of alpha-emitting parent nuclei, or fission products.\\nThe excited electrons are detected by observing the optical radiation produced when the mineral is heated sufficiently to free the trapped electrons and allow them to return to their ground (lowest energy) state. The technique involved is known as thermoluminescence or electroluminescence dating. Since the excited electrons slowly return to the ground state at normal temperatures, this technique has a relatively short time range. Although a 300,000 year range has been claimed (Göksu et al. 1974) other authorities limit its usefulness to about 4000 years (Michels 1973). This method of dating further suffers in lack of precision (22).\\nThe crystal lattice dislocation tracks produced by radioactive decay can be seen with a microscope after suitable etching. Where high concentrations of radioactive material have existed regions that contain alpha-particle damage tracks can be seen without resort to etching techniques, as in pleochroic halos (more correctly termed radiohalos). The density of these halos can be related to the concentration of radioactive material at their center to obtain a crude estimate of the minimum exposure time involved in producing the halo. Microprobe analysis permits relatively precise evaluation of radiogenic daughter to radioactive mother ratios in the halo nucleus. These ratios can readily be expressed in terms of a radioisotope age.\\nRadiometric ages obtained from tracks produced by parent nucleus recoil, alpha-particles, or fission fragments often are in agreement, or at least consistent, with ages obtained from daughter/parent ratios. Discordant but consistent situations arise when there has been total or partial annealing of radiation tracks by elevation of temperature, or migration of either parent or daughter atoms as a result of heating or contact with water.\\nThe existence of isolated polonium radiohalos in uraniferous fossil wood (Gentry et al. 1976) indicates that radiohalos may be formed as a result of prolonged deposition of radioactive material at a halo center site, and are not always dependent on an initial concentration of radioactive material.\\nChondrite Structure Features (24)\\nRadiation damage track investigations have turned up some remarkable evidence concerning the history and formation of meteoroids. Meteorites that have been classified as chondrites are made up of units called chondrules that are cemented together in a matrix to form the meteorite body. Some of these chondrules from inside the meteorite body have been found to be marked on their surfaces by micro-meteoroid impact pits, and to contain in a thin layer of their surface solar wind atom implants and damage tracks from the low energy cosmic radiation produced by the Sun. Identical phenomena are found on the surface of rocks obtained from the Moon. (Ablation during passage through Earth\\'s atmosphere removes such features from the surface of meteorites). Some chondrules have sharp fracture edges. This evidence strongly indicates that chondrites have been formed from an accretion of smaller meteoroid bodies which had been in existence long enough to acquire substantial exposure to solar radiation and cosmic dust.\\nSummary\\nThe picture that emerges from all the data that relate to cosmic chronology appears to be one of dynamic physical processes operating over extended periods of time, during the last 4.5 billion years of which discrete entities of the Solar System have been in existence.\\nTheological Issues\\nIt would not be appropriate to conclude this presentation without some consideration of related theological issues.\\nAny interpretation that is made of the available inspired testimony must satisfactorily accommodate the various lines of evidence concerning geo and cosmic chronology in accord with the basic hermeneutic principle that the books of nature and the Scriptures should be consistent with each other.\\nIt is possible to interpret the book of Genesis to require that all matter in the Solar System came into existence ex nihilo by fiat creation less than 10,000 years ago. This interpretation requires that all the features of mineral, meteoroid, planetary body, and planetary satellite age were the immediate expression of deliberate design on the part of the Creator, and have no relationship to actual age. We should recognize that God has the prerogative to produce a creation in this manner, and that doing so would be less extraordinary than producing the total complex of organic life on this planet within four 24 hour days.\\nIt also is possible to interpret the inspired testimony concerning creation as an eyewitness-style account using language of appearance to describe creative activity that within six consecutive 24-hour days equipped this planet with the total complex of its organic life and established the physical circumstances on which this life depends. According to this interpretation our planet may now contain matter that was in existence as a consequence of creative activity prior to the Genesis Creation Week, matter that was brought into existence during Creation Week, and a relatively minute amount of matter that came into existence in connection with Christ\\'s miracles (specifically His feeding of the multitudes).\\nLet everyone be persuaded in his own mind as to which interpretation he should favor, giving appropriate respect to the considerations that may lead others to choose differently.\\n\\xa0\\nREFERENCES\\n(1) Radiation Cooling of Earth\\n\\nJeffreys, Harold. 1952.

Tkachuck', 'doc': 'THE AGE DATING OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS\\nbyRichard D. TkachuckGeoscience Research Institute\\nTwo seemingly unrelated papers when juxtaposed provide some interesting insights into the problems of dating biological materials. The paper by Weiner et al. [1] describes an analysis of aspartic acid racemization in collagen removed from the Dead Sea Scrolls. In most of the natural world, L-amino acids are incorporated into proteins. Upon death of the organism, a slow racemization of the L-forms to the D-forms takes place. Finally an equilibrium is reached where an equal abundance of both is observed. Under constant laboratory conditions this racemization takes place at predictable rates. It the assumption that the laboratory conditions approximate field conditions over the long haul is valid, it should be possible to determine the age of an organic sample. This method was used by Bada [2] to date human fossil remains found in Sunnyvale, California, at 70,000 years. (A few years earlier a sample from Del Mar, California, was dated at 48,000 years by Bada).\\nIn the work of Weiner et al., racemization data was collected from two different sites of the same manuscript. Several different manuscripts were examined in such a manner. An interior site was chosen which showed little morphological change, while the other site which was along the edge showed morphological change in the collagen form. A sharp boundary between the two regions indicated that the edges of samples became wet sometime in the past. In one case, sample areas were only 5 mm apart. When the various samples were examined for the D/L ratios, significant differences were observed between the two portions of the same scroll fragments. It is suspected that water acts on the collagen to change its physical characteristics to that of a gel. In the gel state, it appears that racemization takes place at a much more rapid rate. Thus relatively minor alterations in the environment of the sample can drastically affect its apparent age.\\nThe paper by Bischoff and Rosenbauer [3] reexamines the Del Mar and Sunnyvale materials which Bada had dated. The skeletal remains were of modern affinities and the dating by Bada has caused some consternation among anthropologists who feel that this is much too early a date for modern man in the new world. Basing their analysis using uranium series dating age for Del Mar was 11,000 years and Sunnyvale was 8300 years.\\nIn conclusion, it can be seen that there are still unresolved difficulties in the age-dating of fossil materials and that caution is urged before the acceptance of a particular interpretation.\\nFOOTNOTES \\n[1]Stephen Weiner, Zina Kustanovich, Emanuel Gil-Av, and Wolfie Traub. 1980.

BrownDirector, Geoscience Research InstituteBerrien Springs, Michigan\\nRelated pages | REACTION |\\nWHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT \\nThis article discusses the basic principles and assumptions of radiocarbon age dating. The author points out the difference between real time and radiocarbon age determinations which have to be adjusted to agree with Bristlecone Pine chronology or biblical chronology. Also, a variety of models for the past history of the earth that might affect the accuracy of radiocarbon ages is evaluated. Variation in the intensity of cosmic rays which produce C-14 is not considered by the author to be a significant source of discrepancy, since evidence indicates that in the past there has not been a significant change in the cosmic ray intensity. Changes in the geomagnetic field which diverts cosmic rays might make C-14 dates appear as much as 11,000 years too old. The influence of changes in the magnetic field of the sun on cosmic rays produces a negligible effect. Higher upper atmosphere water vapor content in the past would produce little effect, since a model based on our present knowledge of molecular relation- ships would allow for only limited changes. The author suggests that the most significant change in the relationship of C-14 dates to real time could come from a dilution of the C-14 by a significantly larger biosphere in the past. An increase of more than two orders of magnitude in this biosphere could make C-14 dates appear 51,000 years too old. \\nThe Radiocarbon Age Concept\\nThe radiocarbon \"date\" or age for a specimen is a statement of the length of time that would be required for a specimen from an idealized contemporary environment to lose by spontaneous radioactive transformation sufficient carbon-14 (C-14) to have the same C-14 concentration as found in the test specimen. Radiocarbon age is a convenient and useful way to express the concentration of C-14 in natural organic and sedimentary material. The idealized contemporary environment reference level is 1.18×10-12 C-14 atom per C-12 atom (one C-14 for 848 billion C-12 atoms), which is equivalent to an average of 13.6 disintegrations of C-14 per minute per gram of carbon.\\nThe better-equipped radiocarbon dating laboratories using the conventional gas or scintillation counting technique are capable of detecting concentrations of C-14 as low as 1.4×10-15 (one atom of C-14 per 700 thousand billion C-12 atoms). To reach a concentration this low by radioactive decay from the contemporary reference level would require in the order of 55,000 years at the rate C-14 now spontaneously converts to nitrogen-14 (N-14). Accordingly, the maximum age range of radiocarbon dating by conventional disintegration rate techniques is said to be approximately 55,000 years. Techniques under development for directly counting C-14 atoms by means of nuclear accelerators hold promise of extending this range to the vicinity of 70,000 years (Bennett 1979). \"Infinite age\" is commonly assigned to a specimen that has a C-14 concentration below the detection threshold of the procedures by which it was analyzed. In practice radiocarbon laboratories are reluctant to specify a radiocarbon age greater than 40,000 due to uncertainties with respect to contamination from younger C-14.\\nA radiocarbon age can have meaning in terms of real time only over time periods during which there has been no introduction of C-14 into the specimen and no loss of C-14 other than by spontaneous radioactive decay. Another way of stating the same restriction is to say that there has been no chemical contamination, that the specimen has been chemically isolated. Under this restriction a radiocarbon age will be directly equivalent to a real-time age if the C-14 concentration in the specimen was initially at the contemporary reference level, and if C-14 radioactive decay has not varied from its present rate. There are no theoretical considerations or experimental data that suggest there has been a significant variation in the decay rate (half-life) (Brown 1974). The initial C-14 concentration must be assumed on a speculative basis, unless calibration by a reliable independent dating technique is available.\\nConversion of Radiocarbon Age into Corresponding Real Time\\nWork that has been done to determine the initial C-14 concentration in the past and make possible a conversion of radiocarbon age into real-time age has been reviewed in Origins, Volume 2, Number 1 (Brown 1975a). Evidence is given there which strongly suggests that in the more remote ancient times the initial C-14 concentration was much lower than has been the case over the past three or four thousand years. Additional evidence of this nature has been presented in the Creation Research Society Quarterly (Brown 1975b).\\nSince this material was published additional analysis has been made of accumulation rates for over 280 peat and sediment features described in Radiocarbon, volumes 8-17 (1966-1975). For the time range represented by C-14 ages 0-4000 the worldwide average accumulation rate for the sedimentary features was determined to be 1.295±0.317 mm per C-14 year. For peat bogs the corresponding average accumulation rate was determined to be 0.726±0.125 mm per C-14 year. For the time range represented by C-14 ages 15,000 - \"infinite,\" the corresponding accumulation rates were found to be 0.333±0.166 mm per C-14 year and 0.203±0.091 mm per C-14 year, respectively. When comparing the 0-4000 with the 15,000 - \"infinite\" C-14 age, these results specify a sediment accumulation rate ratio of 3.89±2.14 and a peat accumulation rate ratio of 3.58±1.72. The magnitude of these ratios, particularly that for sediments, rules out compaction as a satisfactory explanation for the apparently lower accumulation rates in time greater than that which is associated with a C-14 age of 15,000. One must account for the apparent lower accumulation rates as an indication of less favorable conditions for erosion, sedimentation, and peat growth or as an indication of a lower C-14 concentration in the early biosphere.\\nA specimen that began its existence with a C-14 concentration lower than the standard contemporary reference level would reach the C-14 concentration it has at present in less time than is suggested by its conventional radiocarbon age.\\nFigure 1 depicts a first-approximation for the initial C-14 concentration, according to three models for converting radiocarbon age into a real-time age. The contemporary reference level is specified as \"100%\" in this figure. Curve A represents the situation as it would have been if the initial C-14 concentration had been essentially the same as the contemporary reference level throughout the full range of radiocarbon dating. Curve B represents the initial C-14 concentration required by the currently accepted Bristlecone Pine dendrochronology (Ralph et al. 1973). Curve C depicts a situation that would be compatible with the chronological implications of the first eleven chapters of Genesis, taking into account the demonstrated approximate equivalence between radiocarbon ages and real-time at least as far back as 3500 B.P. and the absence of detectable concentrations of C-14 in material that can confidently be considered to have been buried at the time of the flood (anthracite coal, deep-well oil, most natural gas, e.g.). The horizontal bars designated \"Flood\" and \"Creation\" span the time range between the dates for these events as estimated by a straightforward application of the data in the Masoretic text (left end) and the Septuagint text (right end).\\n\\nFIGURE 1. Models for Biosphere C-14 Level. The idealized contemporary reference level is specified as \"100%.\" A: Strictly uniform conditions model. B: First approximation for current Bristlecone Pine dendrochronology model. C: First approximation for biblical chronology model requirements.\\n\\n\\nFIGURE 2. Radiocarbon Age Conversion. First-approximation conversion of conventional C-14 age into real-time age for the models depicted in Figure 1.\\n\\nFigure 2 is a chart for first-approximation conversion of conventional radiocarbon ages into real time according to each of the models represented in Figure 1. This chart makes no distinction between the \"B\" model and the \"C\" model over the range for which dendrochronological calibration is indisputable. The B curve is a smoothed trend line for the MASCA (Museum Applied Science Center for Archaeology) radiocarbon age conversion data. For greater detail the MASCA charts and tabulations should be consulted (Ralph et al. 1973).\\nPossibly the first intensive effort to provide a scientific base for interpretations of radiocarbon ages as suggested by the C curves in Figures 1 and 2 was made in the early 1960s by Henry F. Pearl (1963). Other efforts include Whitelaw (1968) and Clementson (1974).\\nVariability of Initial C-14 Concentration\\nThe model depicted by line C in Figures 1 and 2 translates conventional radiocarbon ages from \"infinity\" to approximately 3500 into a real-time age range no more than about 1800 years. Some support for this model has already been cited (Brown 1975a, 1975b, and above). Are there reasonable factors that could account for so great a compression of the radiocarbon age range? The reasonableness of the following effort to answer this question may depend in part on the confidence of the reader in the historical authenticity of the first eleven chapters of Genesis.\\nInfluence of Cosmic Ray Intensity Variation on C-14 Ages\\nSince C-14 is cosmogenic, i.e., formed by interaction with primary cosmic radiation, there is a possibility that changes in the cosmic ray intensity have brought changes in the biosphere C-14 concentration, as has been the case with nuclear weapon tests. An encounter between a primary cosmic ray particle and an atom often results in the atom being broken up into smaller atoms. Some of these smaller atoms are unstable, i.e., radioactive. Cosmogenic radioactivity in meteorites and rocks from the moon provides a measure of cosmic ray intensity in the past. After exposure of a meteoroid or moon rock to a constant cosmic ray intensity for a time equal to about four half-lives, a cosmogenic radioactive nuclide formed therein reaches an equilibrium concentration at which the number of new atoms formed within a given period of time is equal to the number that experience radioactive decay during the same time. The half-lives for the more than 20 cosmogenic radionuclides found in meteorites and moon rocks cover the range from 5.7 days to 3.7 million years (Shedlovsky et al. 1967; Trivedi and Goel 1973). Within the uncertainty of experimental determinations, these nuclides (manganese-52, aluminum-26, beryllium-10, manganese-53, e.g.) are found to be in equilibrium with the present intensity of cosmic radiation. From these observations it is apparent that the present cosmic ray intensity is essentially the same as the average that has been maintained for longer than any period that can be covered by radiocarbon dating. The experimental data also indicate that any short-time variation of the galactic cosmic ray intensity about the average that may have occurred during this time has been within a factor of two (Forman and Schaeffer 1979).\\nA change in the C-14 concentration by a factor of two would shift the radiocarbon time scale by only 5730 years one half-life. Therefore fluctuations that may have occurred in the cosmic ray intensity cannot be expected to have produced a discrepancy of more than about 5700 years between any radiocarbon age and equivalent real time. In my judgment there is not a sound basis for assigning any C-14 age discrepancy to the cosmic ray intensity factor.\\nInfluence of Geomagnetic Field on C-14 Ages\\nOnly the cosmic ray particles that reach Earth\\'s atmosphere are effective in producing C-14 in the biosphere. The magnetic field of the Earth deflects a large proportion of the incoming cosmic ray particles so that they do not interact with the atmosphere. It has been reliably estimated that if the present geomagnetic field were to completely disappear the C-14 production rate would double (Kigoshi and Hasegawa 1966; Lingenfelter and Ramaty 1970). An eleven-fold increase in the geomagnetic field would reduce the C-14 production rate to one-fourth its present value. An increase in the order of 100-fold would be required to bring the production rate near zero.\\nSince ionizing radiation is harmful to organisms it is to be expected that when life was originally placed on this planet a mechanism for protection from radiation damage was provided. This protection could have been afforded by a capability for healing radiation damage to tissue, a capability that has largely diminished by the present time. It seems more reasonable to presume that such protection was provided, at least in a large measure, by a radiation shield that isolated the biosphere from cosmic radiation.\\nOne can postulate that prior to a catastrophic event such as the Genesis flood the geomagnetic field was strong enough to hold the production of C-14 in the atmosphere to a negligible level. Since the mechanism by which the geomagnetic field is maintained is not understood, there is little restraint against postulating that this field may have been 100-fold greater in the world that was destroyed during the flood episode. But there is no evidence (paleomagnetism of sediments and intrusives in Cambrian and Precambrian formations) that the geomagnetic field strength has ever been so great. With the evidence presently available, it seems to me wisest to suggest that the geomagnetic field was probably greater before the flood than it is at present, but possibly no greater than sufficient to hold the worldwide C-14 production rate to in the order of one-fourth its present value. A factor of one-fourth would reduce the real-time equivalence of the radiocarbon time scale range by two half-lives 11,460 years.\\nMagnetic field effects produced by the sun also influence the rate at which cosmic ray particles interact with Earth\\'s atmosphere. Solar magnetic effects are considered to be a primary cause of the observed fluctuations of radiocarbon age about the average trend that is indicated by the B curve in Figure 2 (Lingenfelter and Ramaty 1970; compare the curves in Ralph et al. 1973). There does not appear to be any need to consider solar magnetic effects in seeking an explanation for order-of-magnitude discrepancies.\\nInfluence of Upper Atmosphere Water Vapor Content on C-14 Ages\\nA magnetic field is not the only means by which the biosphere could have been shielded from the harmful effects of cosmic radiation. The destruction of the original surface features of our planet in the flood experience could have been accompanied by a reduction in the water content of the atmosphere that resulted in conditions more favorable to C-14 production. From Genesis 2:5, 6 it has appeared to many Bible students that in the preflood world moisture requirements of plants were met by a subsoil water supply and heavy dew. Heavy dew implies an atmosphere nearly saturated with water vapor (near 100% relative humidity) during most of a typical 24-hour cycle. Such a condition would provide a comfortable climate if the temperature remained cool.\\nOver the region in which most biosphere C-14 is presently produced 20 km to 75 km above sea level the barometric pressure varies from approximately 55 mm Hg to 0.025 mm Hg, and the temperature varies from -56ºC to -75ºC, respectively, with a temperature maximum of about +10ºC at the 47-53 km level (Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 1970). At these temperatures the saturated vapor pressure of water (or ice) ranges from 0.0138 mm Hg up to 9.2 mm Hg and then down to 0.00105 mm Hg. At the 47-53 km level the ratio of water molecules at +10ºC saturation to nitrogen and oxygen molecules would range between 7.5/1 and 15/1. At the 20 and 75 km levels the corresponding ratio is 0.0025/1 and 0.042/1 respectively. At sea level only 3.6% (ratio of 1/28) of the atmosphere molecules are H2O under conditions of complete water vapor saturation (100% relative humidity) at 27ºC (81ºF).\\nTo estimate C-14 production in a hypothetical preflood atmosphere, let us assume relative humidity near 100% at all levels and a temperature profile similar to that which is now characteristic of the atmosphere in the 20-75 km region. We do not have enough information to construct an atmosphere model that meets the specifications of Genesis 1:6, 7, and are confident that the present temperature profile would be incorrect for such a model, but offer the following as an indication of the limited influence atmospheric water vapor can have on C-14 production. Let us compare an atmosphere with a maximum ratio of H2O molecules to N2 + O2 molecules of 1/28 with an atmosphere for which this ratio ranges between 0.0025/1 and 7.5/1, 7.5/1 and 15/1, and 15/1 and 0.042/1. For a rough estimate the latter can be assumed to have a weighted average of 6/1, giving a comparison between atmospheres with water molecule ratios of 1/28 at sea level and 6/1 higher up in the biosphere.\\nNeutrons released by the breakup of nitrogen and oxygen atoms as a result of an encounter with a primary cosmic ray particle may convert nitrogen-14 into carbon-14, hydrogen-1 into hydrogen-2, nitrogen-14 into nitrogen-15, or oxygen-16 into oxygen-17. The probabilities for these reactions, expressed in the standard nuclear reaction probability units, are respectively: 1.82, 0.332, 0.075, and 0.000,18 barns. The reactions with other isotopes of nitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen are too infrequent to be of concern in this discussion. Given an equal number of encounters of neutrons (thermal) with nitrogen and hydrogen, the ratio of C-14 to H-2 production will be 1.82/0.332 = 5.5/1.\\nSince standard air contains 78% nitrogen molecules, the ratio of water molecules in the atmosphere mixtures we are comparing become 1/22 and 6/0.78, rather than 1/28 and 6/1. For a rough estimate it will suffice to use 1/22 and 8/1. In order to compare the nitrogen molecules with hydrogen molecules equivalent we should use the ratios 22/1 and 1/8, since each water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms, and each nitrogen molecule is composed of two nitrogen atoms.\\nWith the foregoing stipulations we have a C-14 to H-2 production ratio of 5.5/1 × 22/1 = 121/1 in an atmosphere that has the same composition as 100% moisture-saturated sea-level air. Of the C-14 and H-2 atoms produced under these circumstances 99.2% would be C-14 [1]. In 100% moisture-saturated air for the average conditions hypothesized at 20-75 km altitude this ratio is 5.5/1 × 1/8 » 0.7/1. Under such circumstances approximately 40% of the combined C-14 and H-2 production would be C-14. The reader should be cautioned again that the atmospheric model presented here is extremely crude; it requires impossible values of total gas pressure in the 47-53 km region, and unreasonably large H2O/(N2 + O2) ratios. A reduction from 99.2% to 40% is in the ratio 1/2.5 = 1/21.3, which would correspond with a 1.3 half-life compression of the real-time range of the C-14 age scale, only about 7500 years. A more realistic model for a water vapor saturated preflood atmosphere would prescribe a smaller C-14 age correction.\\nInfluence of Biosphere Carbon Inventory on C-14 Ages\\nThe most significant line of reasoning concerning possible mechanisms for a compression of the C-14 age scale is based on estimates of the amounts of non-radioactive carbon in which C-14 has been distributed. C-14 can be compared with red coloring used to make white cake into pink cake. The larger the amount of cake batter into which a given amount of coloring is placed, the less pink the cake will be. It has already been pointed out that the ratio between C-14 and C-12 in the contemporary reference atmosphere is 1/(848 billion). Since the beginning of the industrial revolution this ratio has progressively reduced as a result of burning fossil fuels (Wilson 1978; Nozaki et al. 1978). The combustion of fossil fuel introduces into the atmosphere CO2 that does not contain C-14 and restores to the biosphere carbon from a more luxuriant period in the past.\\nEstimates that have been made of the world carbon inventory are in general agreement (Borchert 1951; Rubey 1951; Revelle and Suess 1957; Bolin 1970; Fairhall and Young 1970; Reiners 1973; Woodwell et al. 1978; and Hall 1979). The estimate that developed out of the 24th Brookhaven Symposium in Biology in 1972 (Reiners 1973) is utilized in Table 1. The estimate for the total \"fossil\" organic carbon inventory given in Table 1 is taken from William Rubey (1951). The term fossil is here used within quotation marks to indicate that some of the buried organic carbon may be primordial rather than associated with organisms. According to the data given by Reiners, the total carbon inventory in the present biosphere is less than one five-hundredth of the total \"fossil\" carbon inventory. On the basis of the estimate given by Rubey, the ratio of total carbon inventory in the present biosphere to the total \"fossil\" organic carbon inventory is 1/176.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nPresuming that the fossil carbon was removed from the biosphere by the flood, one can postulate that the preflood biosphere contained in the order of 500 times more carbon than does the contemporary biosphere. If the same world inventory of C-14 as is now maintained were distributed in this preflood biosphere the level of C-14 activity would have been about 1/500 the contemporary reference level. Since 500 = 28.97 approximately nine C-14 half-lives or 51,000 years of the radiocarbon time scale can be accounted for in this way.\\nEven if one assumes that no sedimentary carbonates were formed during and after the flood and that all present \"fossil\" organic carbon was buried by the flood, the reduction in the active biosphere carbon inventory resulting from flood burials is 176-fold, according to Table 1. On this basis the apparent C-14 age of plant and animal material at the time of the flood would be 42,730 (7.46 × 5730), assuming that the world C-14 inventory at that time was the same as has been characteristic of contemporary times. Since the chronological data in the Bible places the flood approximately 5000 years ago, at the present time this material would have a C-14 age in the order of 48,000. The remaining difference between 48,000 and \"infinite\" (50,000 - 55,000 in practice) C-14 age can be accounted for by assuming that some sedimentary carbonates were formed during and following the flood. One only has to postulate that about 1/6 of the sedimentary carbonates were formed during and after the flood to account for a 45,000 reduction totally on the basis of carbonate precipitation and organism burial [2].\\nSummary of C-14 Time-Scale Adjustment Factors\\nThe physical possibilities for an adjustment of the radiocarbon time scale to chronological requirements implied in the Bible, as discussed in this paper, are summarized in Table 2. Since a scale reduction of only 45,000 C-14 years is required by the C Model depicted in Figures 1 and 2, it is apparent that this model does have a reasonable physical science base. Although the estimates summarized in Table 2 are at best only rough approximations, they seem to clearly establish that geomagnetic field reduction, upper atmosphere water vapor depletion, and biosphere carbon loss that are likely to have been associated with the flood can account for changes in the C-14 concentration that would be adequate for a conversion of radiocarbon ages into real time in a manner that is in agreement with the chronological boundary conditions given in the Bible. Table 3 suggests one way in which these factors might be combined to account for the total C-14 age range.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe model suggested in Table 3 requires a preflood biosphere carbon inventory nearly 130× greater than that of the contemporary biosphere. Many individuals do not consider so great a biosphere carbon inventory to be reasonable. It is unquestionable that a world with a biosphere containing this much carbon would be distinctly different from our present world. It is reasonable to presume that in the preflood world organisms were larger and more abundant and that the portion of the planetary surface capable of supporting luxurious growth was possibly two orders of magnitude greater than at present (e.g., see Table 4-2 of Whittaker 1970), but it should be recognized that if the 130× increase is to be accounted for entirely by carbon in organic compounds, an increase of much more than 1000× is required. I do not believe that sufficient certain knowledge concerning the preflood world is available to either eliminate or adequately model this possibility.\\nIn selecting the last two items of Table 3, 39.03×1012 metric tons of carbon was used for the contemporary biosphere reference, as for items 16 and 17 of Table 1. For the purpose of estimating C-14 concentrations this procedure probably places excessive emphasis on the deep ocean (Table 1, Item 10). With the presently available data on C-14 concentration the deep ocean should probably be assigned a weight factor of approximately 85% in comparison with the upper biosphere as a C-14 reservoir (Broecker 1974, p. 66). Accordingly the denominator in items 16 and 17 of Table 1 would be 0.85 × 35,000 + 4.03 = 33.8 rather than 39.03. This adjustment would permit use of slightly smaller fractions of \"fossil\" carbon and/or sedimentary carbonate for the last two items of Table 3.\\nConclusion\\nFrom the foregoing considerations it appears that data now available for the concentration of C-14 in the biosphere together with reasonable estimates for the active and fossil carbon inventory provide justification for confidence that C-14 age data for time prior to approximately 3500 B.P. are associated with a transition between the pre-biblical-flood biosphere and the contemporary biosphere.\\nFOOTNOTES\\n[1]High altitude rocket soundings have provided data which indicate that the present water vapor concentration at altitudes above 10 km is less than 20 parts per million (Harries et al. 1976; Scholz et al. 1970), more typically less than 5 parts per million (Evans 1974). The production of H-2 by neutron capture is negligible in comparison with the production of C-14 under these circumstances.\\n[2]39.03/(39.03 + 6820 + 13,180/6) = 1/232. 232 = 27.86. 7.86 + 5730 years = 45,027 years.\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nBennett, C.L. 1979.

NY: John Wiley & Sons. 464 p.\\nRadiometric age data must be taken into account in the development of a suitable model for the history of Earth or the solar system. A survey of creationist literature reveals that many of its authors have not under- stood radiometric techniques well enough to satisfactorily relate radiometric age data to their premises. Examples that bring discredit to efforts toward Earth history modeling from a creationist viewpoint are not difficult to find. Because of the extraordinary difficulty of obtaining adequate information for an understanding of radiometric techniques, these authors should not be criticized unsympathetically. The availability of Principles of Isotope Geology now makes it possible for a competent writer to readily obtain an adequate understanding of radiometric techniques.\\nPrinciples of Isotope Geology was designed for use as a textbook and is written with extraordinary clarity. The author is Professor of Geology at Ohio State University and is one of the world’s best-recognized authorities on isotope geology and radiometric dating.\\nThe theoretical foundation and practical techniques for each of the various radiometric dating methods, excepting the recently developed Samarium-Neodymium method, are explained with care. Although Samarium-Neodymium dating is not discussed, references to this method are provided into 1976. The assumptions and restrictive conditions that must be satisfied to interpret radiometric age in terms of real calendric time are fully explained for each method. The discussion of each dating method concludes with an illustrative application to a set of data from the original research literature.\\nThe book also traces the historical development of the scientific principles on which radiometric dating is based. Approximately one-third of the text is given to the geologic significance of variations in the stable isotope composition of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sulphur, strontium and lead. Since stable isotope geochemistry is closely related to radiometric dating, there is great advantage in having both topics treated in the same volume.\\nEach chapter provides an extensive list of references that can enable the reader to readily find access to the authoritative literature on any topic he may wish to pursue further. The text of all but two chapters concludes with a few problem exercises that enable the reader to test his comprehension of the preceding material. Data for these problems are frequently taken from investigations reported in the research literature. Answers are given for most of the problems. Chapters that treat specific techniques are summarized.\\nTwo minor comments may be of assistance to users of this book. The presentation on p 217 would have been improved by specifying the slope age of the thorium-lead isochron shown in Fig. 12:10(a). An appropriate value is 2.64 × 109 years. On p 306-307 it is stated that steady-state equilibrium of carbon-14 is maintained in the atmosphere and hydrosphere, and in living green plants, by “continuous decay” of carbon-14 balanced by continuous production of carbon-14 in the atmosphere and continuous absorption from the atmosphere. Radioactive decay of carbon-14 is a negligible factor in these equilibrating processes. In living plants uniform or equilibrium concentration of carbon-14 is maintained by continuous exchange with the atmosphere. In the atmosphere and upper hydrosphere essentially uniform concentration of carbon-14 is maintained by continuous transfer of carbon-14 to the deep ocean and sediments.\\nAn individual who is seeking for an interpretation of radiometric age data that is compatible with a short history of Earth’s present geologic features or of the solar system will not find it in this book. But he will find unsurpassed convenience of access to an understanding of radiometric age data that is essential for the development of credible models for Earth and solar system history, whatever the premises of these models may be.\\n                \\n                \\n                \\n                \\n            ', 'date': '1979-01-01', 'url': 'https://www.grisda.org/origins-06047'}, {'title': 'Radiometric Age and the Traditional Hebrew-Christian View of Time\\n', 'author': 'Robert H.

BrownGeoscience Research Institute\\nWHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT \\nTraditional Biblical interpretations indicate a period of about 6000 years since creation week. Other interpretations based on radiometric dating suggest that life has been on earth over half a million times longer. This article analyzes some of the scientific data related to radiometric age dating. Of special interest are the facts that: 1) Inconsistencies exist in several areas, 2) the practice of dating an organism or geologic event by dating the rocks associated with it may be unsound since the rocks may be older than the organism or event dated, 3) some radiometric dates are dependent on the size of particles measured, 4) some sequential series of radiometric dates showing increase in age with depth in the earth are due to the nature of the process of ejection from volcanoes and not an increase in age. \\nThe marginal entries in most of the older English Bibles allow less than 6000 years since the Creation described in the first chapters of Genesis. Outside the Hebrew-Christian tradition our world generally has been considered to be of vast antiquity. The Babylonian scholar Berossus (3rd century B.C.) placed Creation at 2,148,323 B.C., the first of the \"10 ancient kings\" (Adam in Genesis 5?) at 468,323 B.C., and the Flood at 36,323 B.C. [1]. The Greek philosopher Plato (4th century B.C.) considered that the Flood occurred about 200 million years ago [2]. Apollonius of Egypt (2nd century B.C.) proposed a mere 155,625 years for the age of the world [3]. The Hindu classics written in the middle of the first millennium after Christ describe the history of the world in terms of endlessly repeating grand cycles of 4.32 billion years duration, each containing one thousand subcycles 4.32 million years in length [4]. Chinese scholars as early as the 3rd century B.C. thought of world history in terms of endlessly repeating cycles and subcycles. I-Hsing (8th century A.D.) placed the beginning of the latest \"Grand Period\" or cycle at 96,962,464 B.C. [5].\\nWithin the last 100 years the dominance in European civilization of the traditional Hebrew-Christian viewpoint concerning the age of our world has been replaced by the \"scientific\" view that planet Earth has been in existence for about 4.56 billion years and has supported complex forms of life over the last 600 million years. The \"scientific\" view is presumed generally to be firmly based on unquestionable radiometric data.\\nThe \"scientific\" view of Earth\\'s age was developed in preliminary form many decades before the discovery of radioactivity. In 1778 Comte de Buffon cautiously broke with Hebrew-Christian tradition in proposing that planet Earth had been in existence more than 75,000 years [6]. In a lecture delivered to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1785, and in a book published ten years later, James Hutton placed the origin of Earth at a vastly remote and indefinite time [7]. In this lecture he set the horizons for geologic time with the classic expression \". . . no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end.\" Immanual Kant placed the original creation \"a series of millions of years and centuries\" into the past [8]. Erasmus Darwin, whose grandson wrote The Origin of Species, actively promoted the concept of evolutionary development of organisms over \"millions of ages\" [9], and the evolutionist, Jean Baptist de Lamarck, at the beginning of the 19th century spoke of time in \"millions of years\" [10].\\nDuring the development of geological science in the early 19th century the span of geologic time was placed in the three million to 1.6 billion year range [11]. These early speculations were based on estimates of sedimentation rates and the total sediment presumed to have accumulated during each of the various divisions of geologic time. The demands of evolution theory were strongly coercive toward estimates that supported the longest time span that could be contrived reasonably. Evolution theorists such as Charles Darwin and T.H. Huxley were uncomfortable with the limited amount of time provided by these early estimates [12].\\nThe 20th century development of radiometric dating produced a geologic time scale that appears to be firmly founded on sound physical science principles and precise measurements. By extending geologic time to over four billion years radiometric dating initially appeared to provide adequate time for a dust-to-man evolutionary development. But the understanding of biochemistry, molecular biology and genetics that has developed within the last quarter century has brought a realization that any phase of the presumed process of organic evolution (formation of the necessary biochemicals, development of primitive living cells, evolution of primitive cells into modern organisms) is unreasonable within the entire span of the radiometric time scale. Thus even if one considers the current popular interpretations of radiometric data to be correct, he must have faith that organic evolution has progressed from cell to man somehow [13] despite insufficient time provided by radiometric dating for the age of the earth.\\nIndividuals who are not acquainted with the research reports in the scientific literature are seldom aware that a high degree of interpretation and selection among available data has been necessary in the development of a radiometrically calibrated geologic time scale. Only data that fit into generally accepted paleontological and geological theory have been utilized in this development [14].\\nThe construction of a radiometric geologic time scale is based on the assumption that mineral samples may be obtained which contain only results of radioactive transformations that have occurred since the mineral was placed in its present surroundings. Another way to state this assumption is to say that radioactive \"clocks\" were \"set to zero\" (the accumulated results of all previous radioactive transformation were removed) when the mineral was either formed or deposited at its present location. According to this assumption the remains of an organism are at least as old as the radiometric age of the mineral that has replaced these remains, of a geologic formation that contains them, or of a geologic formation that overlies or penetrates the formation that contains them. Because it readily led to age interpretations that were consistent with the popular philosophical framework this assumption has not been analyzed as critically as it should have been.\\nIt is not reasonable to expect that naturally occurring physical and chemical processes would isolate radioactive elements and compounds or their stable end-products in absolute chemical purity. Igneous, erosion or solution processes should be expected to transport at least a portion of the daughter products that were initially associated with parent radioactive material at the site of origin. The various radiometric age characteristics at the relocated site should then be expected to reflect to some degree the original radiometric age characteristics, the nature of the transfer process, exposure to heat and fluid circulation since the transfer, and the time since transfer. Only in situations that provide radiometric data for several diverse minerals and radioactive systems can one expect to separate any of these factors from the others.\\nReference to significant disagreement between radiometric age data and conventional geologic age classification appears frequently in the professional literature. A recent paper that has received widespread attention lists 24 22 examples of Tertiary age (65 million years or less on the conventional geologic time table) that have rubidium-strontiurn (Rb-Sr) ages [15] ranging between 70 and 3340 million years [16]. Six Five continental areas are represented in this collection (Table 1). Each of these examples can be explained best on the basis of varying degrees of inheritance of source area radiometric age characteristics for material which has been transported by plutonic or volcanic processes.\\n\\nRecently deposited sediment on the floor of Ross Sea, Antarctica, has been found to have a 250 million year Rb-Sr age. The two major source areas for this sediment are the Transantarctic Mountains that have a radiometric age between 450 and 475 million years and West Antarctica for which the radiometric age is in the 75-175 million year range. The Ross Sea sediments are easily seen to have radiometric age characteristics that reflect a blend of the radiometric age characteristics of the source areas. Evidence that rubidium is incorporated into these sediments directly from sea water, with resultant lowering of the Rb-Sr age characteristics, adds to the difficulty of interpreting the radiometric age data in terms of relative contribution from the source areas, as well as with respect to time of transport [17].\\nAn explanation for the agreement between potassium-argon (K-Ar) age [18]and presumed geologic time can be found for at least some samples in the observation that finer-sized components of a mineral formation may have a younger K-Ar age than larger-sized components, with the average K-Ar age of all components fortuitously in agreement with the presumed geologic age [19]. The higher surface-to-volume ratio of the smaller particles evidently favors a higher percentage of argon loss than from the larger particles, with the consequence that the larger particles retain a K-Ar age closer to that of the original source area.\\nAn oil well in southwestern Louisiana that was drilled into formations which have a conventional geologic age in the 5-25 million year range (Miocene) furnished from the 5190 foot level shale that has a K-Ar age of 164 million years (m.y.) for particles less than ½ micron in diameter, 312 m.y. for ½-2 micron particles, 358 m.y. for 2-10 micron particles, and 372 m.y. for particles greater than 10 microns in diameter. The corresponding whole-rock K-Ar is 254 m.y. The radiometric ages for the sediments in which this well was drilled reflect the radiometric age characteristics of the source areas drained by the Missouri and Ohio river systems, not the time of placement [20].\\nThe validity of the geologic time scale is brought into question also by radiohalos, which are regions of radiation damage surrounding a microscopic inclusion of radioactive material. Coalified wood from Triassic and Jurassic sediments (225-135 m.y. conventional geologic age) has been found that contains radiohalos [22]. If one assumes an in situ decay in the inclusion centers of these halos, the lead-206/uranium-238 ratios present may be expressed in terms of uranium-lead ages [21] ranging between 236 thousand and 2.9 million years. There is no presently available experimental evidence which could exclude the possibility that essentially all the lead-206 in these halo centers was introduced (either directly or as parent polonium-210 or lead-210) together with the uranium, and thus did not accumulate from uranium since the inclusion was formed. There is evidence that the lead isotope ratios in these inclusions are related to the source area(s) from which the uranium was transported during the production of uranium-rich sediments in which coalified wood radiohalos are found, hence invalidating a real-time interpretation of the calculated ages given above.\\nThe original radiometric age characteristics of source material can reflect the primordial characteristics of this material, radioactive transformation since primordial creation, and also exposure to heat, chemical activity and nuclear radiation prior to relocation. Confidence that for many available mineral samples the radioactive transformation effects can be isolated from these other factors is the basis on which a 4.56 billion year solidification age [23] has been established for the Solar System. Individuals whose convictions concerning the interpretation of inspired testimony do not allow so great an age for inorganic material may classify the radiometric features from which this conclusion is derived as primordial characteristics that were introduced in a relatively recent creation [24].\\nThe popular concept that radiometric ages of geologic formations relate directly to their real-time age obtains much support from the observation that volcanic sequences, and volcanic-derived sedimentary sequences, usually exhibit a pattern of increasing radiometric age with depth. It is obvious that the upper material in a given undisturbed sequence was emplaced later than the underlying material. But the radiometric age differences between them does not necessarily represent the real-time emplacement interval. It has been established that the radiometric age profile of a volcanic sequence may be the consequence of: 1) chemical and isotope zonation in the magma chamber that furnished volcanic material, 2) circumstances that were progressively more favorable to resetting a particular radiometric clock (degassing of radiogenic argon, e.g.) as eruptions proceeded, and 3) crustal material incorporated by the magma as it moved upward [25]. There is evidence that fission tracks in crustal material may survive transport by volcanic activity [25a]; however, this is not the case with fission tracks in volcanic glass formed at the time of eruption.\\nIn accord with these considerations the lowest material in a volcanic sequence represents the upper portion of the associated magma chamber and may have erupted in a more viscous, lower temperature state than did material that erupted later and is placed higher up in the sequence. Crustal material that was broken loose and carried along with the first magma that reached the surface could have experienced less annealing (erasure) of previously developed fission tracks than crustal material that was incorporated during later stages of the eruption sequence. Gaseous and other lighter components would likely be enriched in the upper portion of a magma chamber as a result of gravitational differentiation. Thus there are two factors that could contribute to a diminishing content of radiogenic argon as an eruption sequence proceeds lower argon content of the lower portion of the magma chamber and increased degassing of the material that reached the surface at a higher temperature in the latter stages of the eruption sequence.\\nThe book of Genesis references two episodes of crustal deformation and reorganization on planet Earth that are outside the range of prediction or explanation based on the normal day-by-day and year-by-year operation of geophysical processes the original appearance of continents on the third day of Creation week, and the global destruction and reformation described in chapters 6-8. The radiometric age characteristics of many rocks and mineral specimens that are now accessible would be expected to have been altered in each of these episodes. This alteration compounds the difficulties in making historically correct interpretations of radiometric age data.\\nAlthough a fully satisfactory explanation of all radiometric age data undoubtedly awaits more information than is presently available, it is the hope of the author that the information brought together and the suggestions made in this paper will assist in the development of a basic understanding that is consistent with both radiometric data and the chronological stipulations in the Bible.\\nFOOTNOTES\\n[1]Stanley L.

JohnsGraduate Student in PaleontologyMichigan State University, East Lansing, MichiganandInstructor in ReligionColumbia Union College, Takoma Park, Maryland\\nWHAT THIS ARTICLE IS ABOUT \\nIn this sequel to an article that appeared in Origins 3:85-96, the author pursues further the matter of conflicting dates obtained by various lines of evidence. The controversy presented in this article centers around small unique glassy objects called tektites, whose implacement appears to have occurred less than 6000 years ago according to carbon-14 dating, while other dating techniques indicate that the same kind of object when found in the ocean appears to have been placed over one hundred times earlier. Dating of ocean sediments containing these unique objects by a number of techniques which appear to give consistent results does not agree with the dating of comparable terrestrial sediments. \\nSmall, glassy objects in a variety of shapes have been found scattered all across the surface of Australia and southeast Asia. Known as tektites, they were first thought to have originated from outside the earth\\'s atmosphere because of their aerodynamically sculptured surface. Though much of their surface patterns are strikingly similar to the surficial etchings on meteorites, yet the chemical composition of tektites is quite different. Having only a trace of nickel as opposed to meteorites, they are especially rich in silica (SiO2) and rarely are composed of less than 70% SiO2. Thus tektites are not the waste products from meteorite showers.\\nOn the basis of data on samples collected by five Apollo missions to the moon it is generally conceded that tektites were not formed from a shower of molten material (\"moon drops\") propelled toward the earth as a result of meteorite impacts on the lunar surface. Rather, it is now believed that they have originated from gigantic meteorite impacts on the earth itself [1]. It appears that drops of molten material were projected into a low orbit and then re-entered the atmosphere at high speed, finally resting over a wide area known as a strewnfield. Artificial tektites of the same chemical composition as Australian tektites (australites) have been fashioned at air speeds of 17,000 m.p.h. in a wind tunnel at the Smithsonian Institute. To the untrained eye the end product is indistinguishable from natural tektites. Tektites from the Ivory Coast strewnfield have a chemical composition very similar to (if not identical with) the altered rocks of nearby Lake Bosumtwi, which has the main criteria of a meteorite impact site [2]. Recently a probable meteorite impact site, Elgygytgyn Crater, was identified from satellite photos and is now proposed as the source for australites [3]. The australite strewnfield is pie shaped and the apex points in the direction of Elgygytgyn in northeastern Siberia.\\nAustralites have been dated concordantly at 700,000 years by two radiometric dating methods fission track and potassium-argon (K-Ar). This represents a major challenge to conservative Christians wishing to hold to a short Biblical chronology. But these 700,000 year radiometric ages are now under question by the use of another radiometric method, radiocarbon dating. In the 1960\\'s two independent teams of investigators [4], [5] located australites in situ (see ORIGINS 3:85-96). Since the publication of their findings, a third team working independently of the others has reached essentially the same conclusion: that the time of infall for the australites should be in terms of a few thousand years instead of the generally acknowledged radiometric age of 700,000 years [6]. These authors suggest an infall age of 6500 years based on a C14 date of 7300 years for wood fragments in the soil into which australites have fallen.\\nThese conclusions place geologists and geochemists in a quandary. For those who have made first-hand field observations of australites, the evidence is in favor of a geologically young age, whereas those who work with them in the laboratory are convinced that the time when the tektites fell is the time of their last melting when the radiometric clock was re-set approximately 700,000 years ago [7]. According to one way of solving the dilemma, the older age represents their actual age of formation somewhere in space and the younger age represents their terrestrial age. This hypothesis has been ruled out by the fact that no cosmic ray tracks have been detected in tektites, as in meteorites; thus limiting their hypothetical journey in the solar system to less than 300 years [8].\\nAnother solution is to suggest that approximately 700,000 years ago the australites landed elsewhere than their present location and were subsequently washed into place as part of transported sediments a few thousand years ago. After reporting C14 ages of 5700 and 5350 years immediately adjacent to an australite, Gill notes that, if they were transported, neither the tektites nor the buckshot gravel which are always associated together at Port Campbell, Australia, \"could have come far and both must have come gently because the edges are sharp on the australites, and the buckshot is not polished\" [9]. In a later publication Gill reaches the same conclusion: \"The good preservation of the Port Campbell australites is against long residence in the soil, or long transport from one formation to another\" [5].\\nMore recently an author in commenting on Gill\\'s conclusions notes that if the tektites were not transported, then the K-Ar age is under suspicion:\\nThe Port Campbell australites as a geographical group are all astonishingly fresh and undegraded by terrestrial processes, as far as is known, and there seems little possibility that more than one shower is represented at Port Campbell. Hence, it is very difficult to accept Gill and Baker\\'s conclusions, unless the K/Ar age date means something else than is commonly believed [10].\\nA 1976 study by a tektite expert confirms the fact that the dilemma has not yet been solved:\\nThe papers of Gill and of Lovering et al. supply clear evidence that tektites are found on top of recent Australian soils whose ages, as given by carbon dating, are less than 20,000 years. The evidence is strong that they did not reach this position by reworking from older sediments at a higher elevation. For example, a Czechoslovakian study shows that stream erosion will reduce glass objects of roughly tektitic character to about one-ninetieth of the original mass at a distance of 40 km downstream [11].\\nIt is noted that in Lovering\\'s study the nearest possible source for the tektites would be 15-20 km away. In commenting upon the 700,000 age for the flanges of tektites formed in their descent earthward, this expert concludes: \"It appears that we must reject the very recent dates for the Australian tektites: something must be wrong, conceivably the dating of the hardpan\" [12].\\nThe Smithsonian study which was published in 1976 builds an even stronger case for the young age of australite infall, yet even it is unwilling to take that gargantuan leap and suggest that the fission-track and K-Ar ages may be in error. The report ends with these pointed observations:\\nNo one who has seen the Port Campbell localities and examined the many perfectly preserved australites therefrom is likely to argue that these specimens are not being found essentially where they fell. The complete lack of solution etching, even on thin plates weighing as little as 0.03 gram, is a powerful argument against the australites having been subjected to terrestrial weathering, even in situ, for more than a few thousand years [6].\\nEvidence is against their having been transported as sediments, otherwise one would tend to find them concentrated in stream beds. They are found even on sand dunes, a fact which would rule out stream transport. They could not have been traveling through the universe over a period of 700,000 years and then come to earth 6000 years or so before the present (B.P.), otherwise the entry into the earth\\'s atmosphere at high speed would have erased the fission tracks, which are sensitive to heat, and would have driven off the excess argon, thus re-setting the radiometric clocks. The concluding statement of the Smithsonian report aptly summarizes the dilemma:\\nHaving reached an apparently irreconcilable impasse between the physical dating and the geographical dating of the australite fall, one can only turn to the third proposition something else is wrong. Perhaps this can better be stated as something some unsuspected factor has been overlooked [6].\\nTo date, a proposed young age for australite infall has not been overthrown.\\nThe last decade and a half have witnessed not only this epoch-making research come to light but also the discovery of tektites in deep-sea cores to the north, west and south of Australia. Because these marine tektites are never as large as their terrestrial counterparts, they are called microtektites, being the size of microfossils, such as foraminifera, which are less than 1 mm in diameter. Interestingly they retain the same general shapes as their larger relatives, ranging from spherical to tear dropped, disk and even dumbbell and spoon shaped [13]. These microtektites spread over a vast area of the ocean bottom are now undoubtedly linked with the influx of australites upon land because of the following salient facts:\\n\\nThey have identical refractive indices, which is a measure of the amount that visible light is bent passing from air into the glass, as their Australian counterparts.\\nThey have the same range of chemical composition as australites.\\nThe shapes of both are much alike.\\nThey are dated at identically the same age by the fission-track method 710,000 years.\\nOccasionally high-magnesium microtektites are found which would correspond with the less common high-magnesium australites [13], [14], [15].\\n\\nThe evidence both from petrography and geochemistry strongly indicates that Australasian microtektites belong to the infall responsible for australites [16], [17]. That being the case, a careful stratigraphic study of the deep-sea cores in which microtektites have been located should either deny or verify an identically young age for infall. Thus far nineteen Australasian deep-sea cores from widely scattered sites have yielded microtektites [18], [19]. For eight of these cores a detailed magnetic stratigraphy has been determined.\\nMagnetic stratigraphy results from the fact that magnetic particles become oriented in the direction of earth\\'s magnetic field as they fall out of suspension in the quiet water of ocean bottoms. Throughout geohistory the earth\\'s magnetic field has frequently reversed so that the dominant field was not northward but southward. The boundaries between normal and reversed polarity are usually quite distinct in ocean sediments. The most critical boundary in our study is the Matuyama-Brunhes (M-B) boundary, which was first calculated by the K-Ar method to have been formed 690,000 years B.P. [20], and more recently has been dated by fission tracks in volcanic ash [21]. Microtektites in large concentrations occur almost without exception in a very narrow stratigraphic range within 10 cm of the M-B boundary.\\nIt appears to be more than a coincidence that microtektites, which have been dated at approximately 700,000 years by the fission-track and K-Ar methods, should be found in a narrow magnetic boundary zone that has been dated both on land and in the oceans at approximately 700,000 years by the same methods. It is for this reason that geologists reject the obvious terrestrial age of 5000-24,000 radiocarbon years as being embarrassingly too young.\\nThe science of stratigraphy, which involves the correlation of cores drilled into the foraminiferal and radiolarian oozes of the ocean bottoms, has now achieved the reconstruction of climatic oscillation patterns on a worldwide basis. Such patterns can be developed irrespective of whether one accepts the validity of any of the dating systems, including C14, applied to the cores. The criteria which are commonly used to match patterns from widely separated regions are described below.\\n\\n1) Oxygen isotope ratios. The ratio of the heavier O18 isotope to the lighter O16 can be determined very accurately, and it is found that during times of the dominance of polar weather the ratio is higher. The current theory is that when increased amounts of snow accumulated in the far northern and far southern latitudes, the sea levels were lower and hence there would be a relatively higher ratio of O18 to O16 [22]. Conversely, the melting of the ice caps would release into the ocean the lighter O16 that had been incorporated into the snow, thus lowering the O18-O16 ratio. The oxygen isotope ratio taken from foraminifera is directly a measurement of sea levels and only indirectly a measurement of paleotemperature. While on land oxygen isotope ratios in some cases seem to be positively correlated with temperature, as, for example, those from a sequence of 87 tree rings in Alberta, Canada, which correlates nicely with weather bureau records [23]. Just this year an 1800-year continuous sequence of Japanese cedar rings has been reported showing oxygen isotope patterns that match with an 800-year sequence from the Greenland ice cap [24].\\n2) Foraminiferal curves. Foraminifera are one-celled organisms which have a calcium carbonate shell and are a major contributor to the deep-sea sediments. The percentage of polar species to temperate or tropical species can be plotted for the length of the core and a climatic curve developed that correlates nicely with the oxygen isotope curve.\\n3) Coccolith curves. Coccoliths are microfauna that contribute to the oceanic sediments, and, like the foraminifera, the ratios of polar fauna to temperate or tropical fauna can be plotted using the depth of the core as the Y-axis.\\n4) Calcium carbonate percentages. The amount of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in a given section of the deep-sea core can be accurately determined, and a plot of the percentages shows a good fit with the other factors related to climate. The reasoning is that during times of polar weather dominance the growth of marine organisms which are the major contributors of CaCO3 is inhibited.\\n5) Coarse fraction percentages. This is not the measure of the amount of CaCO3 but a determination of the average size of the calcareous clasts or fragments in the sediment. The theory is that during warm weather dominance the marine organisms grow larger and the percentage of coarse fragments would be higher.\\n\\nOther methods have been developed and sometimes show a good correlation with oxygen isotope curves, such as the percentages of ice-rafted debris [25] and radiolarians [26], as well as clay/quartz ratios [27], quartz/mica ratios [28], and the coiling ratios of foraminifera [29], [30].\\nOne of the most intensively studied cores of all the thousands of deep-sea cores retrieved to date is the Caribbean V12-122. When the top four meters of the core are evaluated on the basis of the oxygen isotope, CaCO3, coarse fraction and foraminiferal percentages, the resultant curves show fairly good parallelisms (Figure 1). Note that in this diagram as in all diagrams a fluctuation of the curve to the right denotes warm weather (W) dominance and to the left polar dominance (C).\\n\\nFIGURE 1. Four independent temperature curves for the Caribbean core V12-122 show similar fluctuations (W=Warm, C=Cold). The 3-m level has been dated at 127,000 years by Th230 and Pa231 [36] and has been correlated with Barbados terrace III which is dated at 125,000 years [37]. The fifth paleoclimatic curve is derived from two stalactites in New Zealand. (Re-drawn from references [45], [46], [33].\\n\\nNot only can paleoclimatic curves be developed for oceanic cores but also for terrestrial cores. One of the most problematic of all terrestrial cores has been that of Tenaghi Philippon, Macedonia, which was drilled through 120 meters of lake bottom and marsh sediments. Large sections are composed of peat. It would be difficult to compress the amount of time needed for peat formation into a short chronology, unless one were to postulate that this particular peat were the product of diluvial action; in other words, an allochthonous peat. Also, more than a dozen radiocarbon determinations have been made on the top few meters of the core and a reading of 47,670±2700 years has been obtained at a depth of 16.75 m [31]. Assuming a constant sedimentation rate of 25 mm/103 years computed from the upper 17 meters and extrapolating this rate to the base of the 120 m core, one would conclude that 342,857 years of time are represented. How can this be harmonized with a short chronology of just a few thousand years for post-diluvial time?\\nAlso of interest is correlating the climatic curve derived from this terrestrial core with various oceanic cores. To develop a climatic curve for land deposits one must use pollen as a temperature indicator. It has been discovered that the percentages of arboreal or tree pollen (AP) and of nonarboreal pollen (NAP), which is composed of grasses, herbs, and shrubs, are excellent climatic indices during historical times. Thus it is suggested that in pre-historic times the higher the ratio of AP to total pollen the warmer the climate would have been, and the higher the ratio of NAP to total pollen the cooler the climate. Thus a plot of AP and NAP percentages as a function of depth builds a climatic curve that can be cross-referenced with the deep-sea curves.\\nThe question is whether it is feasible to match terrestrial curves with the deep-sea. A comparison of the two sets of curves indicates that the resultant curves have a very close fit, considering that they are constructed using different parameters. The Philippon core can be matched with the deep-sea core Al 189, which was retrieved from the central part of the Mediterranean Sea (Figure 2). Another terrestrial core that extends even longer than the Philippon core is the 190 m Sabana de Bogota core from Colombia, South America. Its climatic curve constructed out of AP/NAP ratios has a good fit with the deep-sea curve from core V19-28 which is based on oxygen isotope ratios (Figure 2). Located not far off the coast of Ecuador in the Panama basin, core V19-28 has an ash layer at 13.2 m that has been dated in the range of 225,000 to 250,000 years by four different methods, including K-Ar [32].\\n\\nFIGURE 2. Correlation between two terrestrial pollen curves and two marine climatic curves from adjoining ocean basins is demonstrated. The Philippon core is dated with radiocarbon and V19-28 is dated stratigraphically by a distinct ash marker. AP=Arboreal Pollen, NAP=Nonarboreal Pollen. (Drawn from information in references [47], [32], [47], [48] respectively.)\\n\\nOxygen isotope curves can not only be derived from marine cores but also from terrestrial speleothems. A curve based on two stalactites from Waitomo, New Zealand, and dated by C14 dating is compared with the Caribbean V12-122 curve, indicating that matching can be done on a worldwide basis (Figure 1) [33]. Short segments of speleothem oxygen isotope curves from North America that have been dated by Th230/U234 match nicely with cores V12-122 and V19-28 [34].\\nAre such synchronizations of climatic curves mere coincidences? Hardly the case. If these curves were analyzed from the standpoint of probability theory there is only a very slight possibility that even two of the cores could be matched purely on the basis of chance alone. The probability that more than two cores could be coordinated if the curves were not climate dependent would be so small that it can be safely said such curves are indeed controlled by a common variable such as climate rather than by chance processes.\\nCorrelation between widely separated curves can be achieved by noting faunal boundaries, relationships to magnetic reversals, and the presence of volcanic ash layers. Extinctions of certain deep-sea organisms occur at the same interval in matching cores on a worldwide basis. The most convincing example of this is the global extinction of the coccolith Pseudoemiliania lacunosa which occurs at the same interval on matching oxygen isotope curves from seven cores, including V28-238 and K708-7 (see Figure 3) [44]. One would not expect such precision if the deposition patterns were catastrophic and non-uniform.\\n\\nFIGURE 3. The possibility of worldwide correlation is shown by comparing paleoclimatic curves from six marine and two terrestrial cores which span most of the Brunhes magnetic era during which the earth\\'s magnetic field showed normal polarity. The M-B, or Matuyama-Brunhes boundary, marks the transition from reversed to normal polarity. The transition form glacial-type conditions to warm weather is denoted by \"Terminations.\" The Pseudoemiliania lacunosa extinction occurs about midway in the Brunhes and serves as a worldwide stratigraphic marker. (Re-drawn from information in references [48], [50], [41], [52], [47], [47], [45], [35] respectively, left to right.)\\n\\nThe best way for such cores to be matched is by postulating a fairly uniform rate of deposition. If the rate is apt to vary at certain segments of the core by a factor of more than 2 or 3 either below or above the average rate for the whole core, then the curves would not show a close fit. Thus it can be concluded that the sedimentation rates have varied from each other on an average less than a factor of 2 for any significant portion of the cores in Figure 2.\\nIf the rates have been fairly uniform in order to produce a good fit for all these curves, then based upon the present rates of sedimentation the cores would depict a chronology many times longer than the traditional Biblically oriented chronology of 4300 to 5000 years for post-diluvial time. How does one solve this time problem if he wishes to maintain a conservative creationist approach to the subject? In probing for a solution, it is imperative that we first match these shorter core lengths with much longer sequences that extend to the M-B boundary. If that can be accomplished, we can take the tektite-determined age for the M-B boundary as a reference point for dating all deep-sea deposits that are above it.\\nWhat we have done is to select cores from widely scattered geographical areas to determine indeed if climates have fluctuated on a worldwide basis during the period of time which geologists have assigned to the Pleistocene. Of the eight cores represented in Figure 3 three extend to the M-B boundary. Of the other five, two are the longest terrestrial cores with a continuous pollen record Sabana de Bogota of northern Colombia and Tenaghi Philippon of northern Greece. There is a very good match between the Bogota core and the North Atlantic K708-7, and another fine match between the Philippon core and the West Pacific V28-238, showing that terrestrial and deep-sea cores indeed can be correlated. Again it would be most difficult to argue that such matching is purely the product of chance. The sediments of these cores most likely accumulated in situ and provide a fairly reliable picture of temperature at the moment of their deposition. Otherwise, if they were not in situ, or autochthonous, then the temperature curves would show a scrambled picture due to catastrophic activities.\\nThe most intriguing aspect of the cores is the variety of dating methods that have been applied to them. The most commonly used method, the C14, exceeds its usual limit of 50,000 years at a depth of less than one-tenth of the way down to the M-B boundary. Core RC11-209 yields a radiocarbon date of 11,600±600 years at a depth of only 11 cm, which would give a sedimentation rate of 1 cm/103 years [35]. Extrapolating this average rate to the M-B paleomagnetic boundary which occurs at 6.9 m in this particular core, the result is a figure of 690,000 years. It should be noted, however, that generally C14 extrapolated rates do not harmonize so precisely with paleomagnetic data, which are based largely on K-Ar and fission-track dating of terrestrial lavas.\\nOther dating methods that have been used to determine the placement of the M-B boundary either through extrapolation or interpolation are uranium disequilibrium methods, fission tracks, K-Ar, obsidian hydration, and amino acid epimerization. The first three are radiometric, and the last two involve geochemical reactions with many variables. Two of the uranium disequilibrium methods involving Th230 and Pa231 have been applied to the Caribbean core V12-122 and yield concordant sedimentation rates of 2.35 cm/103 years [36]. It should be noted that uranium disequilibrium methods have not always yielded consistent results. This would date the end of the next-to-the-last polar dominance, known as Termination II, at 127,000 years (Figure 1). A recent report has correlated the high warm climatic peak that occurs immediately after Term II with a raised coral reef, which is called Barbados III and is dated at 125,000 years by Th230/U234 [37]. The correlation is accomplished by an oxygen isotope analysis of mollusks from the raised coral reef and by a comparison with oxygen values from deep-sea cores, such as V28-238, which suggest a warmer climate than present and thus higher sea levels for that episode of reef growth. Actually there are three Barbados terraces, the other two being dated at 82,000 and 105,000 B.P. by the same method. These three terraces can be easily correlated with the three successive warm fluctuations just above Term II seen especially well in the Philippon and Bogota curves (Figures 2, 3).\\nVolcanic fragments in deep-sea cores have been dated by two methods; the fission-track method generally yields concordant results with the paleomagnetic age [38], [39], while the K-Ar results from a core that has microtektites are discordant with the paleomagnetic age [40]. Two other dating methods that as yet have not achieved the stature of the radiometric methods because of non-constant rates of chemical change are obsidian hydration and amino acid epimerization (racemization), the former having been applied to several Pacific cores [41], and the latter to cores V12-122 and V28-238 which are dealt with in our study [42], [43].\\nIf we simply take at face value the above-mentioned dating methods that have been applied to deep-sea cores, it confronts us with a strong case for the reliability of their conventional age interpretation. Thus it is important that some concrete, verifiable explanation be advanced in order to maintain a short chronology based upon Biblical data.\\nSince the first paleomagnetic boundary is worldwide and occurs at consistently the same location on the paleoclimatic curves, this can be utilized as a useful time marker. If the microtektites can be positively linked with the same event as australite infall and if radiocarbon dating serves to limit the age of infall to about 5000 or 6000 radiocarbon years ago, then we are forced into dating the M-B boundary at 5000 or 6000 radiocarbon years ago.\\nThis tentative conclusion is valid only to the degree that our techniques of correlation are scientifically sound. Like a steel chain, correlation is no stronger than its weakest link. What we have done is to encircle the earth with our stratigraphic \"chain\" in the following way: first, link the australites on land with the deep-sea microtektites as part of the same infall of tektites; then the microtektites with the M-B boundary, which is usually placed at 690,000 years; the M-B boundary from cores in the Australasian area with the M-B boundary in cores around the world; and finally connect the deep-sea cores with the terrestrial.\\nIf we assign an age of approximately 5000 B.P. for the M-B boundary, then the chronology for all Pleistocene paleoclimatic curves above that boundary would have to be compressed 140-fold from the conventional age of about 700,000 years. The most problematic Pleistocene core, that of Tenaghi Philippon, would likewise have to be reduced 140-fold. The C14 age of 47,670 at 16.75 m must be reduced accordingly to 340 years. Such a drastic reduction is not possible in light of the fact that C14 ages can be correlated with Egyptian chronology at least 3800 years into the past; thus at most there can be a 12-fold reduction if the figure of 3800 years is taken as the minimum time for major disagreement between C14 age and real time, as the evidence seems to indicate. This takes care of only the upper one-seventh or 17 m of the core, leaving more than 100 meters below. If we compress the C14 age at the 17 m level to the minimum allowable (3800 B.P.), then the age for the bottom of the core would be placed at approximately 26,600 B.P. (7×3800), which far exceeds the maximum age of 5000-6000 allowed by microtektite evidence. Therefore, the C14 stratigraphy at Philippon does not allow the compression of the Pleistocene time-scale to the degree demanded by C14 stratigraphy of australites found in situ in southeast Australia. It seems that we are confronted with two incontrovertible, yet incompatible, pieces of evidence.\\nDilemmas such as this serve a much-needed purpose in forcing us to grapple with the problem and to begin earnest painstaking effort at working toward a solution. Further research is urgently needed to either eliminate or confirm any of the above. Let this study be a challenge to creationists to probe into the \"uttermost parts of the sea\" and the \"recesses of the deep\" (Psalm 139:9; Job 38:16) to find adequate answers. In pursuing the footsteps of the Creator even into ocean depths, who knows whether a totally new solution may be uncovered that at present is overlooked! Only time will tell.\\nSUMMARY\\nIf further research continues to validate the youthful age of australite infall, then six apparently interlocking dating methods applied to deep-sea cores must undergo complete revision, resulting in a drastic reduction of Pleistocene chronology and a greatly increased sedimentation rate for all but the uppermost deposits at least 140 times above present rates. An acceptance of the australite infall age of 5000-6000 years B.P. determined by C14 and its worldwide application through paleomagnetic and paleoclimatic correlation has implications that would challenge virtually every radiometric and non-radiometric dating method applied to cave and sedimentary deposits. Thus the present dating methods based upon fission tracks, K-Ar decay, uranium-series disequilibrium (protactinium and thorium), amino acid epimerization, obsidian hydration, and paleomagnetism may stand or fall depending upon future studies into the vast shower of tektites and microtektites in the Australasian region.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1]E.A.

Brown', 'doc': 'C-14 AGE PROFILES FOR ANCIENT SEDIMENTS AND PEAT BOGS\\nbyR. H. BrownDirector, Geoscience Research InstituteBerrien Springs, Michigan\\nIt is sometimes proposed that the correlation between C-14 ages and depth as found in peat bogs and sediments demonstrates the validity of the C-14 dating technique. The comprehensive study presented below shows that such a conclusion is not warranted, since, in the great majority of cases, a linear relationship between depth and C-14 concentration does not exist.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nIn the development of the radiocarbon dating technique, it was recognized that calibration against an independent method of dating past events was necessary for conversion of radioactive carbon measurements into real time. After the development of this technique Dr. Willard Libby was able to demonstrate an approximate one-to-one correspondence between radiocarbon age and real time over a range extending from the present into the early part of the second millennium B.C., provided that the specimen received its carbon from the biosphere during a relatively brief interval of time and was effectively isolated chemically since that time (Libby 1955). Hl. de Vries, H. E. Suess, M. Stuiver and Elizabeth Ralph, utilizing dendrochronological techniques, subsequently led out in the development of refinements for converting C-14 ages into real time (See Olsson 1970). The work of C. W. Ferguson to extend conversion of C-14 dates over an additional three millennia to beyond 7000 B.P. (\"before the present\") using bristlecone pine wood is well known (Olsson 1970). Excellent conversion charts and graphs covering the range from A.D. 1800 to 5350 B.C. have been published recently by the University of Pennsylvania (Ralph et al. 1973).\\nThere is need for a basis on which to interpret radiocarbon ages in excess of 8000 B.P. other than by uncertain extrapolation. Furthermore, the presently available conversion system covering the 4000 to 8000 B.P. range rests on an insecure foundation due to the unique problems of bristlecone pine dendrochronology (insensitivity of growth ring sequences) and the reliance on C-14 dating to establish a master ring chronology which in turn is used to calibrate C-14 ages. Bristlecone pine dendrochronology presently supports the concept that prior to 1000 B.C. the relative C-14 level in Earth\\'s atmosphere was higher than the value that has been maintained with little variation over the past three millennia.\\nThe investigation reported in this paper was undertaken in the hope of making some progress toward a better understanding of the relative C-14 activity in the biosphere during prehistoric times and toward an improved perception of the real time significance that may be attached to C-14 ages.\\nPEAT AND SEDIMENT PROFILE OBSERVATIONS\\nPeat bogs (Figure 1) and sediments that involve organic material contain information concerning C-14 activity in the biosphere that covers the entire range of radiocarbon dating to \"infinite age.\" Unfortunately, this information is available only in a relation between two dependent variables. The three-dimensional relationship between radiocarbon age, feature depth and real time can only be seen in projection on the plane in which a C-14 age versus feature depth profile may be displayed. Real time is a hidden variable that extends normal to this plane. Lacking direct data concerning the relationship between either feature depth or C-14 age and real time, we can hope that a study of the empirical relationships between these two dependent variables will enable us to draw some useful and soundly based conclusions concerning the manner in which either of them have related to real time.\\n\\nFIGURE 1. Section through an ancient peat bog near the town of Sydney Mines, Nova Scotia, Canada. The peat is the darker and thicker layered material which forms the main part of the picture; it rests on lighter colored lithified sediments.\\n\\nIdealized relationships that may be expected between C-14 age and feature or formation depth are illustrated in Figure 2. In plotting these profiles, I have chosen to present C-14 age on the ordinate axis to emphasize that it is a dependent variable. Plots of C-14 age versus depth can be visually classified as A-type, B-type and C-type. Under strictly uniform conditions an A-type linear profile would be produced. Real-time-dependent changes in the relative C-14 activity of the biosphere or in the rates at which sediments and bogs accumulate could produce profiles of either the B-type (convex toward the depth axis) or the C-type (concave toward the depth axis). Samples of A-, B- and C-type profiles that have been reported in the literature are shown in Figures 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Variants of the C-type are illustrated in Figures 6 and 7. Each point represents the measured value and ± one standard error.\\n\\nFIGURE 2. PROFILE TYPE ILLUSTRATION. The departure of the extreme age point from a linear relationship is given by d. The C-14 age range over which the deeper portion of the profile departs from linearity is given by g.\\n\\n\\nFIGURE 3. SAMPLE A-TYPE PROFILE. Torren\\'s Bog (See Table 1).\\n\\n\\nFIGURE 4.

Plöner See (See Table 1).\\n\\n\\nTo make the analysis of a large number of features as objective as possible, a quantitative description of feature profile is necessary. The ordinary mathematical description of curvature would be useful only for profiles that are a straight line or a segment of a circle. A shape factor designation that has been found useful describes the profile in terms of the departure of the extreme end point (maximum age) from a linear relationship. As depicted in Figure 2, we set d equal to the amount by which the C-14 age for the extreme end point departs from a linear relationship. The C-14 age range over which the extreme age portion of the profile is non-linear is represented by g. This construction assumes that a straight line can be satisfactorily fitted to the data points for a more recent portion of the feature.\\nThe profile shape factor S may then be defined as a logarithmic function given by Equation1.\\n\\nData for the features that have been included in this study are presented in Table 1. This listing contains all significant localities that have well-established profile trends to or beyond 9000 B.P. as given in Radiocarbon, volumes 8-16 (1966-1974; volume 16, number 3 is not included), and selected features from volume 5. Also included is a summary of data for the Venice coastal region that were published in Nature, volume 244 (1973). Since a subjective element is involved in curve plotting and determination of appropriate values for d and g, individuals who may wish to check this data should not expect to always agree precisely with the author\\'s selection of shape factor. Cases for which significant uncertainties exist are indicated in Table 1. An effort has been made to bias shape factor determinations toward zero (straight-line type profile) while being open-minded toward non-zero possibilities so that any conclusion reached will be trustworthy.\\nANALYSIS OF COMPOSITE PROFILE CHARACTERISTICS\\nThe profile shape factors from Table 1 are plotted in Figure 8. In this plot, shape factors have been grouped within ranges 0.25 shape factor units in width. Thus all shape factors between +1.00 and +1.24 are plotted in the first column to the right of +1. Those between +1.25 and +1.49 are plotted in the next column. All profiles for which -0.24 < S < +0.24 have been classified as A-type; and all profiles visually judged to be satisfactorily described by a straight line have been assigned a shape factor of zero and arbitrarily plotted between -0.25 and +0.25. According to this convention any profile for which -0.22 < (d/g) < +0.28 is considered to be A-type, i.e., departure of the extreme age point from a linear relationship is within approximately one-fourth the C-14 age range of the curved portion of the extreme age section of the profile.\\n\\nFIGURE 8. PROFILE SHAPE FACTOR SUMMARY. Number of profile shape factors failing within a given integral range 0.25 shape factor units in width. Profiles visually judged to be best represented by a straight line (A-type) are arbitrarily plotted between -0.25 and +0.25.\\n\\n·\\xa0\\xa0 Peat× Sediment¯ Median for range of uncertainty( ) Questionable, may be A-type\\nTable 1 contains 98 features. Of these 22 or 22.4% have A-type profiles, 13 or 13.3% have B-type profiles, and 63 or 64.3% are C-type. The average shape factor for these profiles is 0.60 (within the third column between 0 and +1 of Figure 8), which corresponds to an average d/g value of 0.82. Since the features for which this average has been computed do not all have an identical C-14 age range nor inflection at the same C-14 age, a quantitative interpretation of this average is uncertain. The value 0.82 is large enough to positively rule out compaction as the primary cause for the predominance of C-type profiles.\\nIt seems to be clearly established that the predominant tendency is for ancient peat bogs and sediments to have a C-type profile. The various possibilities for profile development are given an idealized representation in Figure 9. A constant relative C-14 level in the biosphere and a uniform rate of accumulation will produce a perfect A-type profile, as shown in the upper left corner of Figure 9. Opposing changes in the C-14 activity level and the rate of accumulation can also fortuitously combine to produce an A-type profile, as indicated at the right of the second row and in the center of the third row of Figure 9. A C-type profile is seen to be the result of an increasing rate of formation, an increasing level of C-14 activity in the environment, or a combination of increase in both factors.\\nFIGURE 9. PROFILE INTERPRETATION GUIDE.\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nExplanation in terms of an increasing rate of formation accumulation for the 64% tendency toward C-type profiles found in this study requires conditions that were relatively unfavorable, on the average, for peat bog growth and sediment accumulation (erosion) over the time covered by C-14 ages ranging between approximately 5000 B.P. and in the order of 30,000 B.P. The requisite conditions are a warm, dry climate or an arctic climate. Such conditions are not in accord with prevailing concepts concerning glaciation and ancient climate (Flint 1971); nor are they in accord with deductions concerning the probable consequences of a recent world-wide flood. These considerations, combined with recognition of the extremely steep early portions of those peat bog and sediment profiles that extend to the 30,000 and 40,000 B.P. regions, suggest explanation predominantly in terms of an increase in the relative C-14 level of the biosphere. This explanation also contributes to a rational basis for harmonizing C-14 ages with the chronological implications of the first eleven chapters of Genesis.\\nThe existence of A- and B-type profiles for periods which are predominantly characterized by C-type may be accounted for as the consequence of local situations in which the initial rate of bog growth or sediment accumulation was so rapid as to counteract or overbalance, respectively, the effect of increasing C-14 activity on the feature profile. Such conditions may be expected during a period of cool pluviatile climate, particularly when vegetation is being reestablished.\\nThe suggestion that the specific C-14 activity in the biosphere was increasing as a general trend during prehistoric time is reinforced by Figure 10. In this figure over 10,000 radiocarbon age determinations that were reported between 1950 and 1965 are plotted versus centuries of C-14 age. Although it may be argued that the C-14 dating results available by the end of 1965 contain a representative sampling of the entire age range, it also should be recognized that accessibility and archaeological interests probably have favored a disproportionate collection of recent and intermediate dates. With due allowance for such possible bias, Figure 10 indicates plateaus in the availability of C-14 dates over the C-14 age ranges of 30,000-14,000 and 12,000-6,000.\\nFIGURE 10. FREQUENCY OF SAMPLES AS A FUNCTION OF C-14 AGE. Data from \"Radiocarbon Measurements: Comprehensive Index, 1950-1965,\" E. S. Deevey, R. F. Flint, I. Rouse, eds., Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, 1967. Plot courtesy Dr. H. C. Sorensen.\\nThese plateaus could indicate periods of rapid increase in the specific C-14 activity of the biosphere. During such periods the average specific C-14 activity of organisms at death would be constantly increasing, with production of a smaller number of specimens with a given initial activity level than would be the case under a constant level of C-14 activity. For such specimens a ±50 year \"window\" in present measurement of residual activity would correspond with only a few years or possibly months during growth. Accordingly, the representation in Figure 10 could indicate rapid increase in the biosphere C-14 activity level during the period corresponding to 30,000-14,000 C-14 years, less rapid increase in this level over the period corresponding to 12,000-6,000 C-14 years, and approximate constancy of this level over the past 3,000 years (as confirmed by historical and dendrochronological calibration). Transitions would occur during the intervening periods.\\nA rapidly increasing C-14 activity level in the supporting environment also accounts for the anomalous C-14 ages associated with the Chekurovka mammoth 26,000 for hair and 5,610 for overlying peat (Radiocarbon 8:320, 321); the Fairbanks Creek musk ox 24,000 for scalp muscle tissue and 17,200 for hair (Radiocarbon 12:203); the Union Pacific mammoth 11,300 for most recently formed ivory and 5,000 for wood fragments in the surrounding gravel (Radiocarbon 8:172, 173); and the Ferguson Farm mastodon 8,900 for bone collagen and 6,200 for gyttja from within skull cavities (Radiocarbon 10:216).\\nThe data covered in this report do not support the 10% decrease in biosphere C-14 activity level required by the currently accepted bristlecone pine master chronology between 5500 B.P. and 2500 B.P., unless it can be established that there has been a preponderant tendency for increased rates of sediment accumulation and bog growth over the past 5,000 years. This conclusion gains greater force on a detailed examination of the individual profiles listed in Table 1 (the g region of one-half the C-type profiles listed begins between approximately 5000 and 10,000 B.P., with one-fourth beginning below and one-fourth beginning above this range).\\nA general trend of increasing biosphere C-14 specific activity levels over the range of real time covered by C-14 ages between 40,000 and 5000 B.P. is strongly indicated, if not well established, by this study. Consequently C-14 ages in the prehistoric range should be expected to be progressively in excess of the real time involved.\\nFurther refinement and expanded development on the suggestions contained in this report should prove fruitful. For example, it would be desirable to determine the average profile trends for various geographical regions and for various portions of the C-14 age range.\\nREFERENCES\\n\\nFlint, R. F. 1971.

The Journal of Physical Chemistry 76:3603-3612.\\nThe “Anderson experiment,” which has evoked a great deal of general interest, has also been the subject of special discussions among creationists, because of the problems presented by the carbon-14 dating technique for believers in a short Biblical chronology. An analysis of Dr. Anderson’s report follows.\\nUnder certain circumstances the experimental arrangement used by Dr. Anderson yields data that slightly disagree with what one would expect for random, non-related events such as radioactive disintegrations. If C-14 nuclei in plant and animal tissue are interrelated to the extent which might be suggested by Dr. Anderson’s data, the correction implied is inadequate to bring C-14 ages of 20,000 to 50,000 into harmony with a total elapsed time of less than 10,000 years since creation week. To accomplish this would require the C-14 disintegration rate to be increased approximately 500%. The largest apparent increase reported by Dr. Anderson in this article is less than 1%.\\nThe phenomenon presented by Dr. Anderson is extremely subtle. It is scarcely discernable visually in a graphical presentation of his count data (Figure 1 of cited reference). Only refined, highly-sensitive statistical analysis provides unquestionable evidence that his data does not fully conform to expectation for random, non-related events.\\nAn experimental arrangement such as that used by Dr. Anderson always gives normal count statistics for a bulk sample of material containing C-14. Anomalous behavior is only observed for mono-molecular layers of an organic molecule (stearic acid). The stearic acid used in this experiment has been synthesized so that at least some of the organic molecules contain one or more C-14 atoms. The concentration of C-14 in this stearic acid is so high that a few square centimeters of a mono-molecular layer produce in the order of 2000 times as many C-14 disintegrations per minute as is produced by one gram of normal contemporary carbon. Since one square centimeter mono-molecular layer of pure carbon would weigh approximately 50 billionths (5 × 10-8) of a gram, the stearic acid used in Dr. Anderson’s experiments has a C-14 concentration in the order of 40 billion [2000 ˜ (5 × 10-8) ] greater than that found in pure carbon from contemporary natural plant and animal tissue. If the anomalous data obtained in Dr. Anderson’s experiments are due to a proximity effect whereby one C-14 atom decay influences other C-14 atoms to decay, this effect would be expected to be much less apparent with the C-14 concentrations that occur in natural material.\\nIt should be emphasized that the experimental arrangement used by Dr. Anderson gives expected counting statistics for the usual multi-molecular layer samples, for samples that are not adsorbed to a substrate, and for mono-molecular adsorbed layers on a metal (aluminum) foil which is either grounded or maintained at a negative potential with respect to the counting apparatus. Anomalous counting data is obtained only for mono- molecular adsorbed samples that are electrically biased with a positive potential or that are insulated to allow attainment of a positive potential as a result of radioactive decay electron loss. None of these specialized circumstances associated with anomalous counting data would be expected in the natural history of an organic or carbonate specimen which one might want to date.\\nTo what may the anomalous counting data provided by the “Anderson experiment” be due? Possibly, probably in the judgment of this reviewer, to a complex effect of electric field configuration on the effective counting geometry for the unique physical arrangement of this experiment, i.e., to subtle effects of the electric field configuration on backscatter electrons and on the paths followed by the lowest energy beta particles emitted by C-14 decay.\\nSatisfactory accommodation of C-14 data to the requirements of Biblical testimony can probably best be achieved through models based on postulates concerning changes in earth’s magnetic field, atmosphere, and biosphere that may have been a consequence of events associated with the flood.\\n                \\n                \\n                \\n                \\n            ', 'date': '1974-06-01', 'url': 'https://www.grisda.org/origins-01099'}]}\n"

      "['Dinosaur fossils are widespread in Mesozoic sediments, but are absent from the overlying Cenozoic sediments. There is debate over the cause of their extinction. The best-known explanation is that a 10-km  diameter asteroid struck the earth near present-day Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula at a site called Chicxulub. This impact is calculated to have produced a cloud of dust and gases that blocked the sun and caused a severe cooling that killed the dinosaurs. Another explanation for dinosaur extinction is that extensive volcanism of the Deccan Traps in India generated atmospheric gases that caused climate change and killed the dinosaurs. Extensive volcanism has been linked to the end-Permian and end-Triassic mass extinctions, and is considered a likely contributor to the demise of the dinosaurs in the end-Cretaceous mass-extinction. Previous discussions of these two potential mechanisms have focused on fossil patterns and event simulations, but have not attempted to model the link between dinosaur habitat suitability and the relative climatic effects of the volcanism and impact scenarios.This paper compares inferred dinosaur habitat requirements with simulations of the Deccan volcanism and the Chicxulub impact. Simulations show that a solar dimming of >15% would destroy all suitable habitat for dinosaurs and directly cause their extinction.In the simulations, volcanism from the Deccan Traps would not produce changes in climate sufficient to completely destroy the dinosaurs. The extended duration of the volcanism would have produced up to a 5% solar dimming, which could reduce average temperatures by up to about 9.7 oC. This would leave at least some suitable habitat in the tropics where dinosaurs could survive.The Chicxulub asteroid impact would generate large amounts of SO2 and CO2, which would be injected into the atmosphere. In the simulations, SO2 would block the sunlight sufficiently to cause solar dimming of >15%, cooling the atmosphere within five years to temperatures below freezing  for 3-16 years. This would completely destroy all habitat suitable for dinosaurs and cause their extinction. According to these calculations, the impact hypothesis, but not the volcanic hypothesis, is sufficient to explain the extinction.Comment. The global nature of dinosaur extinction calls for an explanation that is global in nature. Volcanism and extraterrestrial impacts may be part of that explanation, but there are reasons to question the standard scenario of extinction due to impact. A major problem is the selectivity of the extinctions. What kind of event would be catastrophic enough to destroy every dinosaur on earth but leave survivors among the crocodilians, frogs, snakes, birds, mammals, flowering plants, and many other groups? None of these groups would have any chance of surviving 3-16 years of continuous sub-freezing global temperatures as proposed in the paper.Abrupt changes in fossil types occur throughout the fossil record. In five cases, at least 75% of the species in one layer are absent in the overlying layers. These abrupt changes in fossil content are interpreted as mass extinctions. Two of these mark major boundaries in the geologic column. The end-Permian mass extinction marks the boundary between Paleozoic and Mesozoic layers, and the end-Cretaceous mass extinction marks the boundary between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic layers.Controversy surrounds the causes of the “big five” mass extinctions. The three causes most widely discussed are: extraterrestrial impacts, especially for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction; huge volcanic flows ; and sea-level changes. Each of these proposed causes has some support and some problems, and none of them has achieved consensus status.An alternative explanation is that all three factors were involved in the global catastrophe described in Genesis 7-8, In this scenario, mass extinctions, including the one associated with extinction of the dinosaurs, are not discrete events separated by millions of years, but are part of a continuous process of sequential destruction of habitats. Abrupt changes in source areas, perhaps associated with effects of rapid plate subduction, extraterrestrial impacts, or volcanic outflows, could produce the abrupt changes in fossil content commonly interpreted as mass extinctions. Much research remains to be done in order to develop a satisfactory explanation of the geologic column, but advances are being made as more data become available and more scientists analyze the evidence from a biblical viewpoint. Regardless, models that support instantaneous to very rapid mass extinction, such as the impact scenario, fit better with a short chronology approach than models entailing protracted and gradual deterioration of ecosystems over thousands to tens of thousands of years.', 'New observational data on the phenomenon of rapid bedrock erosion became recently available after the well documented events that affected the Oroville Dam in February 2017.\\r\\nThe Oroville Dam, located in northern California, USA, confines a large water reservoir  with a retention capacity of about 4 km3. The lake level is controlled through a main spillway, consisting of a concrete chute nearly 1 km long and about 50 m wide that slopes for over 200 vertical meters down to the Feather River . An emergency spillway, designed to be active in cases of extremely high lake levels, is located to the side  of the main spillway, and consists of a linear concrete weir separating the lake waters from the wide valley flank that leads down to the river bed .\\r\\nThe Crisis in February 2017\\nExceptional rainfall in the Winter of 2017 caused significant inflow into the reservoir and required activation of the main spillway to control the lake level. On February 7, an irregular flow behavior was detected in the middle part of the main spillway chute. Water discharge was interrupted to investigate the cause of the anomaly, revealing that the concrete chute was severely damaged over tens of meters. A large section of concrete had been washed away and water had already created an erosional path to the left  of the chute . However, because of increasing lake levels caused by exceptional rainfall, discharge on the damaged spillway was reactivated on February 9, with outflow rates varying between of 1120 and 1820 m3/s. In spite of this renewed outflow, the lake level kept rising, reaching more than 901 feet on the night between February 11 and 12, and causing overflow at the weir of the emergency spillway for the first time in the history of the dam .\\r\\nErosion downhill of the emergency spillway occurred faster and more effectively than expected, with the threat of possible collapse of the weir and consequent catastrophic release of large volumes of water. This risk prompted a mandatory evacuation of the Oroville area , on February 12. Decision makers managing the crisis had to significantly increase the outflow rate at the main spillway (to 2800 m3/s) to bring the lake level below the threshold of the emergency spillway. This would imply further erosion and damage at the main spillway, but it was estimated that the new incision next to the spillway would deepen in a \"controlled\" manner, preventing sheet erosion or another lateral breakout towards the dam. The strategy worked, and on the night between February 12 and 13 the overflow at the weir of the emergency spillway stopped . As the lake level kept decreasing, discharge at the main spillway was also gradually reduced until, on February 27, the outflow was finally halted to begin the subsequent phases of surveying, cleanup, and repair.\\nRemarks and Implications\\nThe extent of erosion attained in just a few days at the main spillway is remarkable. The concrete spillway chute was destroyed and torn away in its middle to lower section. Next to the chute, a canyon was incised, several tens of meters deep and several hundred meters long . Overflow from the emergency spillway removed soil cover and caused significant bedrock incision in just one day .\\r\\nThe bedrock in the area affected by erosion is part of the Jurassic Smartville Complex, and consists of low grade metavolcanics of mafic composition, with sheeted diabase intrusions. The tabular nature of the volcanics and of the subsequent sheeted intrusions confers a distinctively layered aspect to the unit. Layers dip at a relatively high angle to the east, against the slope of the valley . The planar discontinuities of the layering and some fractures favored plucking of blocks as the main mechanism of erosion under solicitation by hydraulic flow, as demonstrated by the abundance of planar faces on the angular blocks in the debris pile and on the jugged surface of the eroded bedrock .\\r\\nWeathered bedrock  is certainly less competent than the fresh lithology , and spatial variations in thickness of this top level might have played a role in determining the points where extensive erosion was initially concentrated. However, significant fresh bedrock erosion took place both at the main spillway and downhill of the emergency spillway .\\r\\nThe debris generated by erosion at the main spillway  accumulated at the foot of the new canyon, rapidly creating a system of coarse-grained, boulder-rich bars at the confluence with the Feather River .\\nAt the beginning of the crisis, there had been fears that the service spillway, initially damaged in its middle section , would be affected by back-stepping erosion and collapse, thus attacking the dam itself. In fact, this happened at first , but most incision seems to have concentrated in the narrowed flow cross-section of the newly cut canyon next to the chute, with relatively minor headward propagation of erosion .\\r\\nThe initial cause of the damage at the main spillway, as well as the extent and mechanisms of subsequent erosion will be thoroughly investigated by engineers and geologists. Here appropriate technical and professional publications are to be expected.\\r\\nThe maximum flow or discharge rate attained in the bedrock incision at the main spillway – 2800 m3/s, reduced by the proportion of water that kept flowing over the chute – is comparable to smaller Icelandic glacial outburst floods , which have rates of 103 to 104 m3/s, and some orders of magnitude lower than a megaflood with rates of ≥ 106 m3/s.\\nThis event of observed erosion provides the rare opportunity to analyze the formation of a canyon and test models used to account for large-scale erosional features of the landscape. After all, the idea is still widespread that deep river canyons  formed over prolonged geologic time by slow and gradual fluvial incision; in contrast, there are observational data that suggest the possibility of canyon formation during high-energy and rapid erosive events. Most importantly, the observation of bedrock erosion and formation of depositional bars over short time scales in a relatively localized area is a powerful miniature representation of what could be expected in the context of non-uniformitarian, large-scale water flows.\\r\\n', ' In Utah and northern Arizona is a unique geological landscape feature, called the Grand Staircase. Imagine a staircase with each step a thousand feet or more high, and many miles wide. That is the Grand Staircase. Each step is a cliff composed of one or more geological formations. The group of formations forming each step begins in Utah and continues to the south until it ends in a cliff. The oldest rocks in this sequence, the Paleozoic rocks seen in the walls of the Grand Canyon, form the lowest step. Each higher step has younger rocks, and its cliff is farther north. The youngest rocks, those forming the highest cliff, don’t extend farther south than the northern part of Utah. How was this staircase formed? A river erodes the land into a valley. The river valley may be deep and narrow, or it may form a wide flood plain, but a river always has a riverbank on each side. The Grand Staircase is like a valley with a riverbank  on only one side. There is much evidence that the Grand Staircase must have been carved out of the landscape, not be rivers, but by a massive, catastrophic flow of water across southwestern United States. THE TASK Previous publications have discussed the concept that a biblical worldview can be applied in ways that suggest scientifically testable hypotheses, and thus lead to productive research. The source of these ideas may come from outside of conventional science, but the ideas and hypotheses can be fully testable by standard scientific research procedures, as exemplified by a number of research projects cited in these references. The following is an example – a case study of what it means to apply that method in geological research.One of the first principles to recognize is that science does not often prove things, and this applies with double force in study of ancient history. Bible believers are often tempted to want proof of creation or the flood. Science does not offer that proof . Valid application of science involves defining hypotheses, and then seeking to test them; to see if these ideas are useful in interpreting the evidence. Of the hypotheses that have been proposed, we want to know which seems to best explain the available evidence.In southern Utah and northern Arizona is a magnificent landscape feature called the Grand Staircase  and we will discuss hypotheses in regard to how this feature was formed. The staircase is a series of giant steps, actually cliffs, dropping down across southern Utah, all the way to the Grand Canyon. At each step a portion of the rock layers forming the geological column ends in a generally southward-facing cliff. The question we will address is what geological processes formed this series of steps? Why do each of these groups of rock formations suddenly end in a cliff?For those who are not geologists we will review several geological processes pertinent to study of the Grand Staircase. Readers who already know the basic geology may wish to skip down to the heading “Methods of Study of the Grand Staircase.”Each rock formation was formed when sediment, such as sand, mud, or pebbles was carried, usually by water, and deposited in a sedimentary layer, or calcium carbonate was precipitated to form limestone. A “formation” is a discrete unit of rock with identifiable characteristics that can be traced and mapped over a recognizable geographic region. Some formations are uniform in composition, e.g., sandstone , or mudstone , but more often they are a combination of more than one type of sediment. These are deposited one formation above the other, with each formation accumulating through some unit of time. The entire set of formations forms the layer cake structure called the geological column . A representative sample of the geological column can be seen in Utah and Arizona.The Grand Canyon was carved through Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks. Those Paleozoic formations extend to the north, under the several formations in southern Utah forming the Triassic portion of the regional sequence of layers . These Paleozoic and Triassic formations, or equivalent formations, extend to the north under the Jurassic and Cretaceous formations. Together, the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous form what is known as the Mesozoic part of the sequence of layers. Farther north there are Cenozoic formations on top of the Paleozoic and Mesozoic rock formations. This entire series of formations composes a time-sequence, like a history book; the lower layers are the oldest, and the upper layers are sequentially younger. This chronological sequence is real, whether one believes it formed in a few thousand years, or in hundreds of millions of years.After these formations were deposited, they were at some time eroded to form the landscape we now see. The features of our landscape always have a geological reason for their characteristics. For example, sandstones and limestones are quite resistant to erosion, and typically erode into cliffs, while softer rocks like mudstone or shale erode into softer hills, slopes and valleys. This landscape-shaping erosion occurs largely through the energy of flowing water, such as streams, rivers, ocean waves, or ocean currents.Ocean waves cut their way through the rock along the shore, moving the shoreline back, and sometimes taking our prime shorefront real estate with them. Rivers carve channels, with a river bank on each side of the channel.Notice that a river leaves a bank, or cliff, on each side of the river channel. We seldom see truly catastrophic water erosion, but experiments and a few geological features indicate the unimaginable power of water moving rapidly on a large scale. As water erodes the landscape it may carve cliffs, with a more erosion-resistant layer forming the cliff, or at least the top of the cliff.In conventional geological theory the major share of erosion through geological history occurred by processes we can observe on the earth today, whereas a biblical worldview implies that some significant portion of erosion events included erosion on a catastrophic scale far beyond our experience. Conventional scientists use their naturalistic paradigm as a basis for developing hypotheses, and a biblical worldview can be used the same way . With these concepts in mind, let us return to the Grand Staircase.METHODS OF STUDY OF THE GRAND STAIRCASE The first step in this project was to find what is known of the geology of the Grand Staircase. Geological maps provided basic information on the rock formations involved, and the nature of their exposure across the Staircase. Other literature on these formations was studied and much travel through Arizona and Utah over several decades provided personal acquaintance with the geology of the region. With this background in mind, the next step was to photograph the geological maps of Utah and Arizona and enter these photographs into Adobe Illustrator. Then color overlays were made, forming bands of color corresponding to the distribution of specific rock formation outcrops across the landscape. Each color band shows the distribution of the set of rock formations composing one of the steps in the Grand Staircase .THE GRAND STAIRCASE The lowest step includes primarily the Paleozoic in the walls of the Grand Canyon, with the Kaibab Limestone forming the top of the cliff.The next step is called the Chocolate Cliffs . The top of this cliff is formed by the erosion-resistant Shinarump Conglomerate. Above that, several red Triassic formations make up the Vermillion Cliffs. The next cliff, the White Cliffs is formed by the Triassic/Jurassic Navajo Sandstone . The Navajo Sandstone in this cliff is primarily white, but in other places it is red, forming part of what is locally called the red-rock country in Utah. The Grey Cliffs are Cretaceous grey shales and other relatively soft rocks. Consequently the Grey Cliffs are not as sharply defined as the other cliffs. Above the Cretaceous Grey Cliffs comes the Cenozoic Claron Formation in the Pink Cliffs.The sequence of cliffs shown in . These are shown in the photographs in . The question we are pursuing is how did this staircase form? What type of water action would be expected to carve such a series of steps?HOW DID THE STAIRCASE FORM? Our first question is whether the steps are primarily the result of erosion of formerly widespread deposits as usually interpreted, or whether these rock formations were originally deposited only where they now appear, with each set of formations only deposited part way south through Utah. If the latter was the case it could explain why the formations did not go farther south, but ended at different places along the way. If they were deposited that way we would expect the formations to get thinner toward the south, until they pinch out, as in .But they are not like that. Some formations get a little thinner, but others get thicker toward the south. The overall effect is not a thinning toward the south, as would be expected if they were not deposited farther south. Each group of formations just continues until they end in a cliff as in . South of each cliff face they were eroded away. The evidence indicates they must have continued much farther south before they were eroded back to where the cliff now is. The dotted lines in . How does that type of erosion happen?We will come back to that question, but first consider what is the size of this staircase feature. .Much of this territory is included in Grand Staircase National Monument. However, the Grand Canyon is just a giant gash across an uplifted part of the landscape, and the same Paleozoic formations continue south  until they end at the lowest step in the staircase – the Mogollon Rim in central Arizona. .In reality there is even more to the Grand Staircase. If we follow the upper cliffs indicated by the colored bands, they go north and then to the east through northern Utah. Above them are two more levels of rock formations, the Uinta and Green River Formations . The Grand Staircase actually is a series of cliffs, one above the other, beginning in northern Utah and dropping down, one step at a time, all the way to the Mogollon Rim across central Arizona, and this staircase also extends into part of western Colorado . This area includes most of what is called the Colorado Plateau.This northern part of the picture does not appear to be quite as clear, because of irregular features in central Utah that complicate the nature of the steps. These include the San Rafael Swell, the Circle Cliffs, and the Teasdale Uplift. But these are not as disruptive to the staircase pattern as they may appear at first. These features are just uplifted areas, like bubbles, that pushed the rock formations up, accompanied by erosion that removed the central areas of each bubble. If we could just flatten these out – iron out the wrinkles in the landscape – the picture would be clearer. Fortunately we can do that with the help of Adobe Illustrator, as in .Without these wrinkles the steps go consistently up as we proceed north, to the upper step in northern Utah, with the middle Mesozoic red rock country extending through the central area of Utah. There are also several mesas composed of remnants of Cretaceous rocks that were not removed by erosion.PROPOSING AND TESTING HYPOTHESES Conventional thought among geologists generally follows the philosophy of Methodological Naturalism, and uses that as a basis for developing hypotheses to explain the phenomena they are studying. Can we use our biblical worldview in the same way, as a basis for developing hypotheses to explain, e.g., the erosion of Utah and Arizona to form the Grand Staircase? Our logic can be clarified if we follow Chamberlain’s recommendation of multiple working hypotheses, and define two or more hypotheses for the shaping of the Grand Staircase, basing some on the concepts of conventional geology and others on a biblical view of earth history. Then our research can seek to open-mindedly compare the hypotheses, and search for data with the potential to test between them. That is a valid and constructive approach to a scientific question. There is another side to that. As Thomas Kuhn suggests, a new idea, no matter how good it is, may never have a fair chance to succeed unless a few persons believe in it enough to diligently seek to develop and apply it in their research. So let us do what he suggests, and proceed with these hypotheses.1. Landscape formation, including the Grand Staircase, in one catastrophe, at end of a global flood.2. Series of such catastrophic erosion events, at end of the flood.3. One catastrophe later, possibly in association with glaciation.4. A series of such catastrophic erosion events, perhaps in association\\xa0with glaciation rather than at the end of the global flood.5. Erosion by fluvial processes  and rain, as occurs today,\\xa0over ~ 5 million years.6. Erosion by fluvial processes, somewhat more extreme than normal,\\xa0but still over millions of years.For our purposes we can simplify these into two working hypotheses:Working hypothesis one : the erosion of the Grand Staircase occurred by processes similar to those we observe today, over millions of years. Since this erosion occurred sometime after the Green River Formation was deposited, there was no ocean in Utah at that time. There was the enormous Lake Bonneville, which drained catastrophically, but that is to the west of our study area. So the erosion of the Grand Staircase would have to be the result of fluvial  processes. But there is a significant problem with that explanation. A river cuts a channel or a wider flood plain with a bank on each side , and does not carve a series of steps as in the Grand Staircase.Thus river erosion does not seem to be a likely process for carving the steps. This conclusion is supported if we add the primary river drainages to the map . The rivers do not follow the steps in any way that seems likely to have cut the steps. In fact in a number of cases the river drainages cut right across the large landscape features.However, we must consider this possibility carefully. It could be suggested that river erosion formed the staircase pattern as the Colorado Plateau region was gradually uplifted. The first proposed step in this process would occur after a partial uplift of the region. Rivers then meandered widely across the landscape, according to this explanation, eroding much of the region down to a stable base level. Then several hundred feet of further uplift resulted in a somewhat smaller region again being eroded down to a new stable base level. If this happened several times, it could be proposed, this could result in the staircase as we see it now. If this occurred, it would involve meandering rivers fairly uniformly eroding several thousand square miles at each step in the process, followed by an episode of uplift and then a repeat of the erosion process. Is this repetitive uplift and erosion process likely? Can we find evidence of these meandering river systems in the plateaus of the Grand Staircase? There is a paper describing one Miocene river in northern Arizona that is no longer a river. Is there evidence for the multitude of such paleodrainages that would be required to form the Staircase?There is another significant challenge for this scenario. The process would have to erode away any evidence of the southern “bank” of the river valley or flood plain where this occurred, leaving only the south-facing cliffs that would have formed the northern bank of the system. Is there any evidence, or a likely hypothesis for the disappearance of the southern flank of such an ancient river system? This scenario must be considered, but I suggest that the evidence presented here suggests that a different process is required to explain the Grand Staircase./ Arizona landscape to look like if it was eroded by fluvial  processes. If the Grand Staircase had been carved by river systems there should be an evident relationship between the rivers and the shape of the landscape, but the actual cliffs do not show such a relationship to the existing river systems. The evidence we have looked at does not seem consistent with working hypothesis one – forming the cliffs by river erosion, as it occurs in the modern world.. The drainage on top of the mesa is toward the south .There are wide valleys there with dendritic drainage patterns within each of these valleys. They don’t drain over the northern edge of the mesa, but drain to the south. If we look at the mesa wall from the northeast  these valleys appear as hanging valleys .It appears as if the valleys were formed before the rock formations forming the mesa were eroded away from the area north of the mesa. Then the drainages on top of the mesa continued to drain to the south. This also is consistent with the other evidence discussed above, that questions whether river-related processes provide adequate explanations for the origin of these landscape features.Now consider working hypothesis two : The rock formations covered Utah and northern Arizona as indicated by the dotted lines in . Then catastrophic water flow  on a massive geographic scale flowed over the Colorado Plateau with the energy and erosive processes to rapidly erode back the formations, moving the cliffs or scarps back to the north, one after the other . If the water flowed from the north, headward erosion began cutting at the south, proceeding back to the north, with the southern area eroded more deeply to form the lowest of the steps. Or the erosion could have followed a different pattern, but whatever the specific pattern, the Grand Staircase was cut into the landscape by one or more of these catastrophic events. If this occurred, careful research may possibly find evidence for the direction and pattern of water flow that produced the existing landscape.The hypothesis that best fits the evidence is large-scale water flow that shapes the landscape features, often cutting channels across these features, and rivers only cut the final touches into the landscape , as in . In this hypothesis the southward drainage system on Black Mesa was established when the mesa still extended farther to the north. I propose that the catastrophic erosion removed the former northern extension of the mesa, leaving the hanging valleys as remnants of the original drainage pattern.The southern edge of the series of cliffs in the Grand Staircase is very irregular. Is this contrary to the explanation I am suggesting? Was the erosion of the steps controlled by structural features like faults and folds? There is a series of faults and folds that are a prominent feature of southern Utah geology. However, these features are all north-south trending geological structural features, as shown in cross-section in .In the western part of the staircase are three major north-south faults, and in each case the sediments are raised up on the east side of the fault. Then farther east from these are three prominent monoclines, which in each case are folded up toward the west. These dramatic features are shown in . Since they are oriented north-south, they could not be the cause of the staircase, but actually cut across the steps in the staircase. The faults and folds are irrelevant to the origin of the staircase pattern. The staircase cliffs have only been shifted in north-south directions by these structural features, but not formed by them.On the east side of the Cockscomb monocline the Triassic and Jurassic formations that make the cliffs to the west have gone underground, but the cliff topography continues to the east as two prominent cliffs in the Cretaceous formations. The lower of these cliffs is continuous with, and contains the same rock formations as the Straight Cliffs on the east side of that area . It can be suggested that the same large-scale water flow that formed the Grand Staircase also carried the cliff pattern across these Cretaceous formations.AN ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATION Another explanation for the cliffs of the Grand Staircase is presented by Schmidt.6 Using geological observations in the Colorado Plateau he concludes that each of the steps has eroded back  at rates of 1 to 9 kilometers per million years. He bases this on careful logic and observations, so it cannot be just brushed off. However, his conclusion is based on, and dependent on two assumptions that are not directly stated in the paper, but are clear from his presentation of data and interpretations. One assumption is that the scarp retreat process occurred through processes consistent with what is generally active today . But the evidence I have presented above raises doubts about the adequacy of these modern fluvial processes to explain the origin of the enormous staircase-like series of cliffs, which drop down consistently in one direction.The other assumption is his acceptance of the radiometric time scale, which is the basis for his time calculations. That time scale is not consistent with a Bible-based worldview, but there is nothing in my analysis of the staircase phenomenon that can address the time issue. If we leave aside for now the question of time, the physical evidence described above still strongly suggests that his model is not adequate to explain the evidence, no matter what the time scale.How could Schmidt and his colleagues be so wrong? Are they practicing careless science? I see no evidence of that. The existence of two such radically different models for formation of the Grand Staircase can only be understood if we consider the dominant role of worldviews in our approach to such scientific questions. If a geologist is fully convinced that the conventional, naturalistic explanation of earth history is correct and the only viable scientific approach , that philosophy rules their scientific thinking on the big questions of history. To consider the possibility that biblical catastrophism could suggest explanations worth a second thought is not generally going to happen. Only someone with personal confidence that the God of the Bible knows more about geology than we do will take seriously a geological model that is initiated or encouraged by a biblical worldview. Even if such a model is absolutely correct, it will not succeed unless there are logically thinking, properly educated persons with the determination to develop the model and apply it in research. Have I proved my conclusions about the origin of the Grand Staircase? No, certainly not, but I predict that working hypothesis two will be found to be going in the right direction, and clearly is most consistent with the data. Even though our discussion of the origin of the Grand Staircase arose from a religious perspective, it resulted in these testable hypotheses – testable by careful study of the geomorphological evidence. I suggest that this project illustrates how a biblical worldview can be an effective platform for scientific thinking and hypothesis development and testing. An alternate worldview, applied consciously and deliberately as we have done in this project, can lead to constructive, even better hypotheses. I propose that there are many geological or biological questions to which this worldview, applied consciously and deliberately, can lead to better understanding, or at least to deeper testing of the concepts being studied. The hypotheses that we propose may be supported by such research, or the research may lead to better hypotheses that can also be tested. Either way will result in improved scientific understanding, as our alternate hypotheses provide the incentive and some suggestions for further research. W. M. Davis, a prominent geologist encouraged the pursuit of what he called “outrageous hypotheses,” since most really new ideas in geology will seem outrageous at first. He may not have been willing to accept my hypothesis on the Grand Staircase as a legitimate outrageous hypothesis, but I propose that his concept can be appropriately expanded as I am doing.Some individuals may be reticent to approach research in this way, because they have seen some biblically-oriented scientific research that was done in a shallow way. Actually there has been shallow research done on all sides of the philosophical spectrum, so that is not an adequate reason for avoiding a novel approach. Quality research has also been done in all of those quarters. Careful work, testing multiple hypotheses, is essential and will lead us in the right direction.This paper presents a preliminary analysis and suggests hypotheses for testing. This is not a finished conclusion, but proposes an idea that can lead to extensive field geology research, and also experimental modeling, on the question of scarp retreat and the erosional history of the Grand Staircase – an opportunity for productive research that would probably not occur if our biblical worldview did not lead us to think it provides constructive insights. I will not be the person to pursue this research, considering what stage of my career I am in. I hope someone does take up the awesome opportunity for research presented by the Grand Staircase, and seeks better explanations for its origin.', 'The hypothesis of a large meteorite impacting the surface of the Earth at the end of the Cretaceous was introduced almost four decades ago. In the ensuing years, the geologic community gathered a large body of data in support of this hypothesis, elevating it to the status of a universally accepted fact of Earth history. However, competing models and lively discussions are still unfolding over the dynamics and environmental consequences of this large impact. This short article attempts to a) summarize the evidence that led to the acceptance of the hypothesis; b) assess current areas of uncertainty related to the impact hypothesis; and c) consider ways in which this event is relevant for creationist thinking.History of the hypothesis and geologic evidenceThe original physical evidence that led Alvarez et al. to suggest the impact hypothesis was an anomalously high content of the heavy element iridium in thin clay deposits stratigraphically placed at the so-called K-Pg boundary , the contact between Cretaceous and Paleogene rocks. Iridium is much more abundant in meteorites than in the rocks of Earth’s crust. Therefore, Alvarez et al. concluded that all the extra iridium found in the clay boundary layer must have come from the impact of a large extraterrestrial bolide, the dust of which settled after being projected and dispersed through the Earth’s atmosphere. The theory gained strength because the iridium anomaly was detected at the K-Pg boundary in many localities around the globe, a prediction of the impact hypothesis. It was also noted that K-Pg boundary clays were enriched not only in iridium but also in other noble metals more abundant in meteorites than on Earth’s crust. Furthermore, numerous tiny spherules of glass and other minerals were discovered in the boundary layer and interpreted as droplets of melt and vaporized rock, ejected after the impact and solidified during fallout. K-Pg boundary deposits were also found to contain shocked grains, which are small mineral granules showing features diagnostic of shock-induced deformation . Such shock features were expected to form in crystals of target rock hit by the impactor and ejected from the crater area. Finally, a surprisingly large amount of soot, a form of elemental carbon produced in the burning of flames, was also detected in some boundary clay deposits, leading to the suggestion that the impact had ignited global wildfires.In their 1980 paper, Alvarez et al. had already made an estimate of the size of the asteroid (~10km), predicting a diameter for the impact crater of about 200 km. However, ten years after the publication of their paper no crater structure had yet been found. It seemed that the thickness of ejecta deposits  decreased away from North-Central America, an area where there was also evidence of tsunami-related deposition thought to have occurred near the impact site. Therefore, the crater had to be located somewhere between North and South America. Eventually, Hildebrand et al. localized a subsurface circular structure in the Yucatán Peninsula  of matching size, expected stratigraphic position , and with the right type of impact-related rocks and deposits to be identified as the impact crater. This structure was given the name of Chicxulub Crater. Finding that the last missing piece of the puzzle fulfilled former predictions helped to settle the case in favor of the impact hypothesis.Developments and open questionsSince its discovery, the Chicxulub Crater has been studied with geophysical methods and wells have been drilled to better characterize the structure and its deposits. It appears that the crater is a multi-ring structure, with large concentric fault systems and tilted blocks around its rim, and a central uplift where deep crust and even upper mantle material was upwarped by several kilometers. Impact-related deposits include impact melt, melt-bearing breccias, and large uplifted blocks of granitic basement with pervasive evidence of shock features. The thickness of these deposits varies, but can reach up to several km within the crater. Uncertainties remain about the specific dynamics that generated the multi-ring structure during the impact, the reason for asymmetries observed in the structure, and the lithology and horizontal and vertical distribution of different impact-related deposits in the crater.The study of the ejecta deposits has also significantly advanced after the discovery of the Chicxulub Crater. Their thickness, composition, and sedimentology seem to correspond well with the location of the impact at Chicxulub. Proximal deposits are thicker  and generally indicative of more energetic deposition, whereas distal deposits are thin  and deposited through settling . Early reports had already suggested the possibility of tsunami-related deposition caused by the impact in proximal areas. However, high-quality geophysical data have revealed the truly astonishing proportions of sedimentation processes triggered by the event. For example, in the Gulf of Mexico, a region close to the impact site, the boundary layer can be very thick  and is traceable all across the basin. It appears to consist of debris flows and turbidites generated by earthquakes and tsunamis, causing significant erosion and resuspension of unconsolidated sediment. Not all the sediment in this boundary deposit, considered the most voluminous event deposit known to date in the geologic record, was derived from the impact crater. A substantial component was sourced from slope instability and erosion of shelf platforms close to the impact site.However, a dissenting interpretation of the ejecta deposits has been strongly advocated by Gerta Keller  and colleagues. This alternative view suggests that some of the deposits usually interpreted as forming rapidly by sediment gravity flows related to the impact formed instead over a prolonged period of time after the impact. Therefore, they do not represent the actual K-Pg boundary. The evidence in support of this view is based on detailed sedimentological and paleontological analyses, showing a more complex picture than usually assumed. It includes the presence of distinct and multiple spherule layers, occurrence of burrowing and sedimentary structures in the boundary deposits requiring a certain amount of time to form, and erosion and reworking at the K-Pg boundary that may impede precise age attribution. If the Chicxulub Crater predates the K-Pg boundary, it could be possible that a different, subsequent impact caused the iridium anomaly, and some possibilities for multiple impact scenarios have been discussed in the literature, although they have not gained much traction. Most importantly, if the impact precedes the K-Pg boundary by a substantial amount of time, it cannot be the direct cause for the remarkable disappearance of many groups of fossils  observed across the boundary. The link between the impact and patterns of extinctions observed in sedimentary layers spanning the K-Pg boundary has always been the most controversial aspect of the hypothesis. Many paleontologists believe that the distribution of different groups of organisms in the layers below and above the K-Pg boundary was not caused by the impact, and favor more gradualistic models of extinction caused by progressive deterioration of environmental conditions, perhaps aggravated by the impact. The most commonly invoked alternative as the cause for mass extinction is large scale volcanism recorded in the Deccan Large Igneous Province , which also spans the K-Pg boundary.Modelling and reconstruction of the environmental effects of the impact is also an area where considerable differences in view have emerged. The original scenario proposed by Alvarez et al.  of ejected dust obscuring the sky for years and shutting down photosynthesis was found to overestimate the dust load in the ejecta plume, but variants of the “impact winter” hypothesis are commonly discussed in the literature. The hypothesis of global wildfires was also reconsidered, because levels of charcoal in the boundary layer are low and soot probably derived from the ignition of organic matter in the target rocks rather than from burning forests. Models also show that the thermal radiation caused by reentry of ejecta particles in the atmosphere was probably not sufficient to cause global wildfires. Other suggested effects in the aftermath of the impact include acid rains and absorption of solar radiation by sulfur aerosols produced by the vaporization of sulfur-bearing sediments in the impact target rocks.Finally, an important focus of research on the impact hypothesis has been the characterization of the type of impactor, based on geochemical signatures left in the ejecta deposits, with the consensus seeming to indicate a carbonaceous chondrite.Implications for creationist thinkingPhilosophical implications: The impact hypothesis has been instrumental in breaking the mold of gradualistic thinking in geology, spurring a new way of looking at geologic data, with renewed openness to and interest in large scale and catastrophic processes. Although this trend had already been signaled by the acceptance of Bretz’s megaflood hypothesis, the exponential growth of publications addressing catastrophes in the Earth systems was certainly favored by a change in the cultural milieu where the impact hypothesis of Alvarez et al. played an important role. Creationist thinking is sympathetic to the development of catastrophic models, because a short chronology requires a great amount of geologic activity to occur over a short amount of time and because the biblical account mentions a short but globally cataclysmic flood. Therefore, creationists have benefited and will continue to benefit from the development of neocatastrophist hypotheses, with increased possibilities for common interests in research projects and collaborations with secular scholars.Geological implications: A first consideration about the impact hypothesis is that its development and corroboration attest to the reliability of the discipline of stratigraphy. It was stratigraphy that led geochemists in their search around the world for a peak in the concentration of iridium, a peak that, in most disparate places, was where the work of stratigraphers had previously located the K-Pg boundary. This impressive example of the power and high resolution of stratigraphic correlation counters the arguments of those who are skeptical about the reliability of stratigraphy and about the value of the geologic column as a framework to spatially organize rock units.Secondly, impact-related processes and deposits are an open window to the remarkable signature of catastrophic events in the rock record and have the potential to revolutionize the gradualistic interpretive approach. In sedimentology, impact-related deposits provide an example of rapid  basin-scale deposition of hundreds of meters of sediment. and basin-scale erosion and remobilization of unconsolidated sediment. In structural geology, crater formation requires extreme rock weakening, to the point of fluidization, offering instructive scenarios for crust and mantle softening that could help model plate tectonic processes within a catastrophist framework. Cratering also offers an example of almost instantaneous formation of faults and tectonic features. In igneous geology, models have shown that large impacts can produce massive amounts of melts almost instantaneously, leading to the suggestion that impacts might even have been responsible for the emplacement of some large igneous provinces. At the same time, not everything in the geologic record of impacts is massive or disruptive. For example, some distal ejecta layers are only mm thin and often found sandwiched in relatively undisturbed fine grained marine deposits. Therefore, impact deposition epitomizes well the formidable complexity of the geologic record. The same event that accounts for hundreds of meters of sediment and complete disruption in one area is expressed elsewhere by a perfectly identifiable thin layer within hundreds of meters of unrelated rocks.Finally, the physical evidence attributed to the impact is a prime example of how the rocks have a story to tell. There are indeed large shocked blocks of basement and tens of meters of breccia in the subsurface of the Yucatán Peninsula, tiny spherules forming thin layers can be found near or at the K-Pg boundary in several locations around the world, and an anomalously high concentration of iridium can be globally detected in a very precise stratigraphic interval. These observations, and many others more, can be placed together in a coherent picture. in spite of all the uncertainties and limitations intrinsic to the practice of historical sciences. The reconstruction of what occurred might not be exactly right in all of its aspects, but the rocks are indeed there to challenge and alert us that something did happen.Biblical implications: Perhaps, the most obvious question for creationists is where does the timing of the impact event fit within the framework of Earth history presented in the Scriptures. Historical narratives in the Bible do not contain a description of an impact event. Consequently, we should be cautious when advocating for a specific position in the absence of explicit biblical references. The Bible does mention the global flood of Genesis as a time of major geologic activity, with the chiastic structure of Genesis 7:11 indicating the involvement of both endogenic and exogenic forces. Among the latter, signified by the “opening of the windows of heaven,” one could fit collisions of extraterrestrial objects. Indeed, in the creationist literature large meteoritic impacts on the Earth are most commonly associated with the flood event.Theological implications: The destructive and catastrophic nature of a large impact event has the potential to raise questions about God’s interaction with the creation and about the nature of His character. One could ask if meteoritic impacts are contingencies allowed to occur within a complex created universe or if they are a direct expression of God’s plan.In particular, if God oversaw the unfolding of the impact event during the Genesis flood, was that accomplished through direct or secondary causation? Was there design and divine intent in the specifics of the location, energy, and timing of the impact? Answers to these questions can be placed on a spectrum between the two extremes of hyperdeterminism, where every minimal detail of geological phenomena has a predetermined purpose, and a naturalistic-like “closed system” view, where God is excluded from any further interaction with the world after the setting in motion of its laws. More significantly, one could ask how the God of love, the giver and protector of life, could be so intimately associated with an utterly destructive event. In searching for answers to these difficult questions, the Genesis narrative clearly describes how the flood and its geologic processes occurred after the entrance of evil into the world and as a consequence of the total corruption of God’s original creation. The textual evidence powerfully presents the flood as the “undoing of creation.” Therefore, God’s action can be seen as a withdrawal of His sustaining, ordering, and life-giving power, an expression of how things dissolve when we reject His presence. And yet, at the acme of the chiastic structure of the Genesis flood narration, we are told that “God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the animals that were with him in the ark” (Gen 8:1). It is hard to imagine a way short of God’s miraculous protection that could preserve a human-made wood vessel and its passengers in the midst of such cataclysmic forces, of which the Chicxulub impact might have been just a small component. However, instead of taking our everyday existence as a granted necessity of nature, we should recognize behind its sustenance the same miraculous grace and mercy that carried the ark and its occupants through a perilous journey.Ronny Nalin, PhD, ', 'Iceland is a volcanic island in the North Atlantic Ocean, slightly below the Arctic Circle. The island is situated on a mid-ocean ridge at the boundary between the North American plate and the Eurasian plate. In Iceland, we find evidence of horizontal movements, in which two plates spread apart as the crust dilates with intrusion of new magma. Iceland, however, is also associated with a mantle plume  that has maintained volcanism high and vigorous . Spreading creates some sort of symmetry in the buildup of the island  with the youngest rocks situated on the ridge and the older rocks away from the ridge on both sides .\\r\\nThe rocks forming the island are mostly stacks of solidified lava flows. The lava flows are inclined towards the spreading ridge, exposing a continuous sequence of lava flows that date from the middle Miocene to the present. In the oldest part of the sequence, found in the glacially carved fjords of eastern and western Iceland, the lava flows are intercalated with sediments and deposits with plant remains of large trees not found in Iceland today . Continuing upwards in the sequence, we find volcanic products and sediments that are linked to the Ice Age  , and then on top of the sequence at the ridge we find young lava flows and sediments formed after the Ice Age .\\r\\nThe earliest volcanism in Iceland is regarded as being mostly of so called flood basalt type, that is, large outpourings of magma from fissures, forming lava flows that covered widespread areas , . Around the world, we find several provinces with flood basalts that indicate events of great turmoil in earth’s mantle in the past. Some of these lava flows in these provinces have volumes 100’s to 1,000’s of km3. These events are difficult to explain in conventional uniformitarian terms, but fit well into catastrophic creationist models e.g. ,  that place this volcanism in conjunction with the biblical Flood and its aftermath. Flood basalt volcanism has only recently caught the attention of scientists, and ongoing volcanic activity in Iceland could help in deciphering the effects of such colossal volcanism. For example, the eruption of Laki in 1783-84, which is regarded by many geologists as a small flood basalt eruption, created a lava flow field of about 15 km3 in 8 months (common sizes of modern eruptions are <0.1 km3), and released about 120 million tons of sulfur dioxide , triggering temperature drops in Europe of about 1-3°C , . The cooling resulted in bad winters and summers leading to poverty and famine in Europe and the death of thousands of people , while famine and fluoride poisoning of the surface waters in Iceland caused the death of over 50% of the livestock. The 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano was observed to trigger algae blooms under the ash plume , while elevated levels of sulfuric acid, HCL, HF, and metal concentration were measured in snow and precipitation in the Holuhraun eruption in 2014-15 . Furthermore, although not an observation from Iceland, volcanic emissions of CO2 can result in artificial radiocarbon ages  caused by excess CO2 concentrations in the volcanic grounds . These examples demonstrate that the secondary effects of volcanic eruptions can be many, and we expect the environmental pressure of the flood basalt volcanism around the world in earth’s past history to have been enormous, something that creationists should explore in light of the volcanism associated with the biblical Flood and its aftermath.\\r\\nIceland has a wide variety of volcanic products, created in volcanic events ranging from effusive lava outpourings to explosive eruptions . Considering that the largest glaciers in Europe are found in Iceland, some of the volcanic eruptions in Iceland occurred and will occur under glaciers .\\r\\nWhen magma erupts under water/ice it fragments generating tephra and volcanic breccia, which reworked and remobilized in the water form volcanic sediment deposits . Later, these deposits are modified and hardened by hydrothermal alteration and become what geologists call hyaloclastites. Thus, hyaloclastite deposits preserve evidence of transport by currents and gravity flows indicative of relatively rapid formation within the watery environment of these subglacial eruptions. The process of alteration in the hyaloclastites was thought to require a long time but took only a few years to happen in Surtsey Island that emerged from the sea in an eruption in 1963-67 . Therefore, subglacial eruptions may be a good analogue to very dynamic, high-energy watery environments with rapid sedimentation, reworking, transportation and hardening of sedimentary deposits.\\r\\nAnother interesting phenomenon observed in Iceland is the generation of large volumes of meltwater with geothermal activity and volcanism under glaciers. These meltwaters can burst in high-energy catastrophic flooding events. Outburst floods from eruptions in the glacially covered Katla volcano are estimated to have reached flow rates >200,000 m3/s  . The force of such raging waters carve canyons in hours and leave vast sedimentary flood plains. The canyons of the touristic Gullfoss and Detifoss waterfalls, and the “sandur” deposits  in south Iceland are a witness to these glacial outburst floods.\\r\\nTherefore, Iceland provides insight into several geological processes of great relevance to creationists working on developing models for processes that might have occurred during or after the biblical Flood. Going from plate tectonics, the ice age, flood basalt volcanism and its secondary effects, to catastrophic erosion and sedimentation, all these themes are displayed in an unspoiled environment immersed with natural beauty.\\r\\nBjarnason, I., 2008, An Iceland hotspot saga, Jökull, 2008, 58, 3-16.\\r\\nDenk, T.; Grímsson, F. and Kvacek, Z., 2005, The Miocene floras of Iceland and their significance for late Cainozoic North Atlantic biogeography, Botanical Journal of Linnean Society, 149, 369-417.\\r\\nGeirsdóttir, Á., 2011, Chapter 16 - Pliocene and Pleistocene Glaciations of Iceland: A Brief Overview of the Glacial History, Jurgen Ehlers, P.

Geologists who enjoy reading this “book” have found that it consists of two “volumes:” the first, named Precambrian, is mostly devoid of macroscopic fossils. The second, named Phanerozoic, contains layers and sediments providing a rich archive of past forms of animal and vegetal life. The Phanerozoic “volume” is further subdivided in three “sections,” called Paleozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic, each consisting of several “chapters”  .\\r\\nThis article focuses on the Paleozoic interval of the geologic record. Estimates from global compilations of maps suggest that about 20% of the surface of the Earth is covered by Paleozoic rocks . These rocks are usually well preserved, although mineralogical modifications  and physical disruption  are common. Therefore, Paleozoic rocks represent a substantial and accessible part of the rock record and attempting a comprehensive synthesis of their main characteristics in a blog post is an impossible task. This overview concentrates on selected topics about Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks, fossil patterns, and tectonics. The article will close with some suggestions on the significance form a creationist perspective of salient features and trends in Paleozoic rocks.\\r\\nPaleozoic Sedimentary Rocks\\n1) Global Stratigraphic Signal. There is a great variety of types represented in Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. However, when looking at the macroscale, certain types of rocks show a specific frequency increase within the Paleozoic or some of its intervals. This non-random pattern of stratigraphic distribution  is often observed on a global scale. Examples include: Cambrian sandstone composed almost exclusively of quartz , found across most of the North American continent and documented on other continents ; peaks in abundance of carbonate deposits in the lower and mid-Paleozoic , including  globally distributed facies such as stromatolites  and flat-pebble conglomerates  ; widespread marine black shales, rich in organic carbon, common in the lower Paleozoic and upper Devonian-Mississippian ; abundant reef-like deposits in the Silurian and especially in the Devonian ; immense coal deposits in the Pennsylvanian and Permian ; and extremely wide and thick accumulations of evaporites in the Permian .\\r\\n2) Widespread Marine Deposition over the Continents. Lower to mid-Paleozoic sedimentary rocks are remarkable in documenting large-scale flooding and establishment of seas over continental interiors. This is perhaps best seen in the North American rock record, where up to four major successive continent-wide flooding phases can be observed in Paleozoic deposits . The topography of the submerged continents must have been very subdued because the layers deposited over the flooded landscape generally show extremely high lateral continuity and flat basal contacts . In some cases, even thin beds only a few cm thick can be followed laterally for tens of kilometers .\\r\\n3) Upward Increase in Terrestrial Deposits. If it is true that the lower to mid-Paleozoic is dominated by marine deposits even over continental landmasses, terrestrial deposits become substantially more represented in the upper Paleozoic, from the Pennsylvanian upward . In addition, the style of fluvial deposition also appears to differ, with predominantly sheet-like sandy deposits in the lower Paleozoic being complemented from the mid-Paleozoic upward by mud-rich deposits, interpreted as more typical of meandering rivers .\\r\\n4) From Low to High Frequency Cyclicity\\nWhen tracing rock units along the vertical direction, it is common to see repetitions of certain types of deposits . The cyclical pattern in these rock types reflects changes in the environments of deposition, such as variations in water depth and sediment supply. These changes in rock types, often marked by discontinuity surfaces between packages of layers, are observed throughout Paleozoic sedimentary deposits. However, in the upper Paleozoic  a marked increase in the frequency of these sedimentary cycles is observed on a global scale . Broadly speaking, lower to mid-Paleozoic relatively monotonous deposits are overlain by cyclical successions more intensely punctuated by discontinuities and alternations of different rock types.\\r\\nPaleozoic Igneous Rocks\\n1) Volcanic Rocks. It is difficult to systematically address global trends in volumes and types of volcanism during the Paleozoic, because of limitations due to the incomplete nature of the rock record. Notably, while basaltic rocks of the ocean floor offer a continuous record of submarine volcanism for the Cenozoic and part of the Mesozoic, only slivers of Paleozoic oceanic crust are preserved. However, Paleozoic rocks do contain a record of some notable episodes of volcanic activity. For example, Upper Ordovician deposits from North America and Europe contain a cluster of ash layers attributed to some of the largest explosive volcanic eruptions ever recorded in the whole Phanerozoic . Large igneous provinces , which are regions preserving immense volumes of lava effused within a very narrow stratigraphic interval, have also been documented for the Paleozoic. They include Cambrian, Devonian, and Permian examples, the most spectacular being the Siberian Traps in Russia, where an estimated volume of over 2 million km3 of magma were mobilized at the very end of the Paleozoic .\\r\\n2) Plutonic Rocks. Plutonic rocks form from the solidification of magma at depth in the Earth’s crust and constitute the core of the continents. The study of plutonic rocks, therefore, helps to understand the timing and process of formation of the continents. For example, it would be interesting to know how much of the continental crust formed or was recycled during the Paleozoic. Limitations in dating and the incompleteness of the rock record hamper these types of reconstructions. However, some clues can be obtained in indirect ways. Zircon, for example, is a mineral that forms during the crystallization of magma and is very durable and resistant. Even if the original intrusive rock hosting a zircon is eroded, the detrital zircon may survive and be included in younger rocks. Studies looking at the age distribution of detrital zircons indicate that the Paleozoic was one of several intervals with significant crystallization or recycling of crust . Another way to assess the Paleozoic production of plutonic rocks is to look at their preserved surface area compiled from geologic maps. It appears that Paleozoic plutonic rocks are more abundant on the Earth’s surface than their Precambrian or Cenozoic counterparts . This confirms that the Paleozoic was an interval of significant magma emplacement and crystallization.\\r\\nPaleozoic Fossil Patterns\\n1) Diversity Trends. The most remarkable aspect of the Paleozoic rock record is the abundance of macroscopic animal fossils when compared with underlying Precambrian rocks. This major transition has been called the “Cambrian explosion” and occurs in lower Cambrian strata, where fossils of most animal phyla first appear . An equally important interval is what has been called the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event , referring to a remarkable increase in diversity of marine fossil groups in the Lower to Mid-Ordovician . The Cambrian explosion is unique for the sudden appearance of a large number of new animal body plans, but the GOBE shows the greatest increase in diversity of fossil forms within already known body plans. As a result of these two important stratigraphic intervals, Paleozoic marine faunas can be broadly divided in two groups : the Cambrian fauna  and the overlying Paleozoic fauna  . These faunas are punctuated by several turnovers at specific stratigraphic levels , where the coordinated disappearance of certain groups is observed .\\r\\n2) Ecological Trends. Along with increased diversity, the GOBE seems to mark a shift to marine faunal assemblages representative of greater ecological complexity . Cambrian layers contain mostly invertebrates that lived on the surface of bottom sediments, but overlying strata include planktonic organisms, fish, burrowers, and suspension feeders that stood taller above the bottom because they were erect. Another important transition is observed in mid-Paleozoic strata, where the fossil record ceases to include only marine organisms and begins to document terrestrial organisms. Macroscopic fossils of land plants first appear in the Silurian and become more common in the Devonian , terrestrial invertebrates  first appear in the Devonian , and a few tracks and remains of land vertebrates first appear in the Devonian  but become common in the Carboniferous. Notable groups completely absent from Paleozoic layers are dinosaurs, mammals, birds, and flowering plants.\\r\\nPaleozoic Plate Tectonics\\nReconstructions based on paleomagnetism and distribution of major orogenic belts seem to indicate that the initial Paleozoic con. Interestingly, whereas most of the margins of these continents show lowermost Paleozoic patterns of sedimentation typical of passive, extensional margins, a remarkable tectonic shift is observed in the Upper Cambrian to Ordovician, where most of these continental margins show evidence for the onset of large scale active convergence . An intriguing aspect of Ordovician plate tectonics is that none of the widespread convergent margins seem to involve collision between continents but only accretion of microcontinents and volcanic arcs, a condition not seen in any other part of the Phanerozoic . A sustained trend of convergence is consistently documented by orogenic belts along continental margins throughout the Paleozoic, resulting in the progressive amalgamation of the different continental masses. Paleogeographic reconstructions indicate that the continents were finally assembled into a supercontinent  by the Early Permian, a con.\\r\\nAnother feature of interest for Paleozoic plate tectonics is the suggestion of a Cambrian episode of significant true polar wander . This phenomenon implies the redistribution of continental masses with respect to Earth’s axis of rotation resulting in movements of tens of degrees of latitude  and representing a mechanism of plate motions faster than and different from classic plate tectonics.\\r\\nThe Paleozoic: A Creationist Perspective\\nThe existence of a discontinuity in terms of fossil content between the Precambrian and the Paleozoic makes it tempting for creationists to link this horizon to a major discontinuity in Earth’s history. This perception is reinforced when considering that the base of the Paleozoic is often expressed with a physical stratigraphic discontinuity  that marks a mechanical-erosional boundary and a significant shift in sedimentary and tectonic conditions .\\r\\nFrom a biblically informed perspective, a possible candidate to generate such discontinuity would be the global flood of Genesis 6-8. Some Paleozoic sedimentary patterns would fit well on a general level with the description of the biblical catastrophe, in particular the patterns of extensive flooding of continental masses and global signature in the style of sedimentation. Extensive plate rearrangements could also be hypothesized as part of the flood event, and the lowermost Paleozoic presents an interesting interval where both fast plate reorganization and change in predominant tectonic regime seem to be documented. Certainly, plate tectonics offer an important background mechanism to explain several Paleozoic trends. For example, the progressive assembly of Pangea might have controlled the Paleozoic trend in increasing terrestrialization observed both in the sedimentary and fossil record. Interestingly, this parallel increase in preservation of continental deposits and land fossils supports the suggestion of creationists that trends in appearance of fossil groups result at least in part from sampling of different habitats and ecosystems rather than biological evolution. The trend toward a supercontinent con. Finally, active plate convergence during the Paleozoic would account for the modal peak in Paleozoic igneous rocks, as continental collision settings tend to be favorable for the preservation of new continental crust .\\r\\nIn the modern history of creationism, the general consensus about where to place Paleozoic rocks in biblical history has followed an interesting trajectory. The majority of Scriptural geologists, in the first half of the 19th century, assigned the formation of Paleozoic rocks to the time between Day 3 of creation and the onset of the flood . The trend was decidedly reversed in the 20th century, when key . Price, H. Clark, H. Morris, and J. Whitcomb clearly interpreted the formation of Paleozoic fossil-bearing rocks as a consequence of the flood . In the past two decades, there has been renewed consideration among some creationists of the possibility that part of the Paleozoic might have been deposited before the flood .\\r\\nGiven the immensity of data archived in the Paleozoic rock record, any attempt at a synthetic model from a creationist perspective will have to find the delicate balance between an ability to see the bigger picture without overlooking important details. Before that balance is reached, an exciting work of study and discovery will continue to accompany us in our journey.\\r\\nRonny Nalin, PhD\\n\\nEndontes\\n41.

      "['When we think of the importance of nature for Christians, major ideas that come to mind include caring for the environment (for example, by reducing/recycling/reusing or through prevention of natural disasters, such as fires) and learning about the life of plants and animals, the structure of the earth, or other aspects of the creation. But what about fossils? Do we ever think that the study of fossils is important for Christians? Fossils: What They Are and Do Fossils are organisms of the past, or remains of their activities that have been preserved in the rocks. How can petrified plants, bones, or shells be important for a Christian believer? First, Christians, as most other people, are curious. Finding a fossil shell, bone, teeth, or leaf in a rock immediately draws our attention. Children are especially captivated by fossils, and some of them carry that interest on into their adult lives and become paleontologists. God reveals Himself in the Bible, and most significantly in the life of His Son, Jesus. But the Bible’s revelation indicates that nature is also full of lessons that can point to the wisdom and qualities of its Creator. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, the psalmist claims, “The heavens declare the glory of God” (Ps. 19:1); and the patriarch Job asserts, “But now ask the beasts, and they will teach you; and the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; and the fish of the sea will explain to you” (Job 12:7, 8, NKJV).1 How do we speak to the earth? How does the earth teach, and what does it teach us? How do we speak to the fish, and what do we learn from them? Paleontologists “speak” to the earth through scientific study of the fossils and the rocks that contain them. The fossils and rocks speak to us through analysis of their attributes, such as mineral content and physical structure. Indeed, we even speak to fossil fish, which are some of the most abundant fossils found in the rocks, millions of them in sedimentary rocks, often showing excellent preservation. By the study of their preservation and characteristics we ascertain what these organisms of the past were like, how they lived, and the qualities of the environment they inhabited. This applies to all kinds of fossils. Paleontologists also compare fossils with living counterparts in order to understand how the former lived, died, and were preserved. For example, multiple studies in modern habitats show that dead fish do not last long on the sea floor or the bottom of a lake.2 They are quickly scavenged by other animals or destroyed by microbial decay. If that also was the case in ancient environments, how then are there any fossil fish at all? For many paleontologists, the existence of fossil fish in the rock record is an indication that in the past some environments were different from what we observe in the present, or that some geological processes occurred differently and favored preservation over destruction of many specimens. Fossils and Faith People of the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim faiths believe that many of the fossils now found in the rocks were organisms living before or during Noah’s flood, the global catastrophe by water recounted in the Bible. Rapid and massive deposition of sediments must have occurred during that global catastrophic event, and millions of fish must have been buried, resulting in fossilization. The same may be said for many other aquatic organisms, as well as for terrestrial organisms such as reptiles, mammals, birds, and plants. Destruction and decay after death is the norm in modern and ancient times, and yet millions of fossils are in the rock record, strongly suggesting that most of those fossils might have been formed during a global catastrophe that brought about sudden death and burial. Some species survived, while others went extinct. Thus, the global Flood described in the Bible provides a good model for the occurrence of millions of fossils in the fossil record, and the study of the fossils gives us clues as to how the Flood must have occurred in terms of geological processes. This is one reason Christians believe that fossils are important. Fossils also tell us what ancient organisms looked like, at least from what can be inferred from their hard parts (shells, bones, teeth, wood, etc.). By carefully studying the characteristics of fossils, paleontologists learn that some of the organisms of the past were morphologically different from ones living today, whereas others were similar or equivalent to modern ones. People who believe that life arose on earth during millions of years beginning from simple forms and evolving into more complex and diverse organisms invoke these differences in the fossils and their occurrence at different levels of the rock layers to support their theory. If that theory is true, there should be millions of intermediate fossil forms as well as living intermediates among animals and plants. An informed Christian who has studied the fossil record knows that such is not the case: fossils do not show the gradual morphological variations expected in a slow, long pace of gradual change over long geological time. When paleontologists find a fossil frog, a fossil turtle, or a fossil fern, they clearly discern what kinds of organisms they are. There are no obvious intermediate or transitional forms in the fossil record. Some may argue that the bird Archaeopteryx, with amixture of reptilian and avian characteristics, could qualify as an intermediate form in the evolution of birds from reptiles. However, paleontologists believe that Archaeopteryx is in reality a bird with “mosaic” traits, not necessarily indicating an evolutionary lineage.This understanding is in harmony with the biblical statement that God created every living creature “according to their kinds” (Gen. 1:21, 24, 25). In the original creation there were no intermediate or transitional forms like those expected in the evolutionary model of gradual appearance of life. Instead, distinct forms of plant and animal life were differentiated into kinds that Adam could name without confusion. The same pattern of clarity is found in fossils. Christian researchers with a high view of the Bible find that the fossil record confirms the pattern of distinctiveness of life forms that Genesis asserts, and this is another important reason the study of fossils is relevant. In recent years several scientists have reported the occurrence of soft tissue and organic molecules in fossils that in some cases have been assigned ages of tens or hundreds of millions of years, based on radiometric dating. Examples are proteins, lipids, DNA, and vascular tissue found in dinosaur bones, shells, teeth, amber, and plants. Even functional bacteria have been found in sediments purportedly millions of years old. Yet scientists know that it is impossible for complex organic molecules to be preserved and survive for millions of years. These molecules become unstable and degrade, especially in the presence of water. How are they then preserved in fossils that allegedly are millions of years old? There are good reasons to believe that these fossils are only a few thousand years old, not millions. The discovery of preserved organic molecules in fossils is a strong indication that fossils are not as old as radiometric dating and the evolutionary theory suggest. This is another excellent reason for Christians to study fossils. Learning More About Fossils Some Seventh-day Adventist institutions have realized that fossils provide an excellent resource for teaching about the history of life, earth history, the biblical account of Creation, and the Flood. Universities in many countries—Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, South Korea, the United States—as well as many schools, have prepared displays in which aspects of the fossil record are interpreted in light of the biblical worldview of Creation and the Flood. Other Christian institutions have also built museums and displays that feature fossils. Through these displays many students, teachers, and visitors can not only appreciate the beauty of fossils, but also explain them in a way consistent with the teachings of Scripture regarding Creation and the Flood. Many Christian students realize that the modern study of fossils yields quality information that challenges evolutionary theory and long ages for life on earth, and provides an excellent way to share their faith in God’s revelation. Fossils and the rocks in which they are contained are an excellent platform for discussing origins from a biblical perspective, especially in relation to the design and complexity of ancient life and the worldwide destruction caused by Noah’s Flood. Many questions regarding fossils, origins, Creation, and the Flood are still there for us to investigate, and the Geoscience Research Institute, where I serve as a scientist, is committed to supporting our students and institutions as they engage in the scientific study of the creation within a biblical worldview.', 'Two fossil arthropods from Cambrian deposits in Utah (the lower Cambrian Pioche Shale and the middle Cambrian Marjum Formation) have been found to have nervous tissue preserved. The fossils are both assigned to the genus Alalcomenaeus, which is believed to have been a small, bottom-dwelling predatory animal, reaching a maximum length of six cm (about 2 1/3 inches). It is classified as a member of an extinct group known as “great appendage arthropods,” which includes some other lower Cambrian arthropods such as Leanchoilia and Yohoia. Alalcomenaeus is well known from the Burgess Shale of Canada and is also reported from the Chinese Chengjiang fauna. The Alalcomenaeus nervous system closely resembles the nervous systems of modern arthropods in general organization. A ventral nerve cord extends the length of the body, with branches to the body segments. The “brain” region has branches to the four stalked eyes, the “great appendages,” and three pairs of ventral appendages. Preservation of nervous tissue is rare, so these fossils provide important information about the nature of the nervous system in Cambrian arthropods. Care was taken to exclude the possibility that the fossil traces might be remains of the digestive system rather than the nervous system. First, the fossil nerve cord was connected with the eye stalks, and second, it formed a loop around the location where the esophagus would fit. These are features of the arthropod nervous system and are not seen in arthropod digestive systems. Preservation of the nervous system in these fossils corroborates claims of preservation of nervous system tissues previously reported in several other Cambrian arthropods. Comment. This report is significant because it shows that complex nervous systems were present in Cambrian arthropods and because it shows evidence of rapid preservation of the fossils. There is no evidence that the arthropod nervous system developed gradually through some kind of evolutionary development. As expected from a creationist viewpoint, fossil and modern arthropods have similar nervous systems. Rapid preservation is evident from the state of preservation of the entire animals, including the eyes, and from the abundant well-preserved fossils in the layers associated with the fossils. The design of the nervous system points to an intelligence acting in the creation of these animals, and the evidence of rapid preservation indicates a catastrophic event that buried and preserved these extinct marine creatures.', 'What Are Fossils? Fossils are remains or other evidence of organisms that lived in the past and are preserved in the rocks. Common fossils include hard parts like bones, teeth and eggs of animals, wood, leaves and other parts of plants, shells, corals, and tiny shells of microfossils. Exceptionally, soft tissue of plants and animals may be found fossilized in permafrost (like Ice Age mammoths preserved in the Siberian tundra), insects and seeds preserved in amber (resin from trees), bodies of animals preserved by mummification, plant material preserved in peat, and other rare occurrences of fossilized soft tissue. Some fossils consist of impressions of body parts, for example, the mark of the skin of dinosaurs left on the preserved footprints, impressions of plant leaves and insects, etc. Some ancient molecules (DNA, protein, keratin, collagen, etc.) have been preserved in bones, shells and other fossils. Another type of fossils is called trace fossils or ichnofossils, in which no body parts are preserved, but evidence is preserved of the activity of the organism before it died. Common ichnofossils are burrows made in the sediment before it became indurated, footprints of vertebrates and invertebrates walking on soft ground, borings in shells and rocks, coprolites (fossil excrements), and root traces. The many different kinds of fossils occurring in sedimentary layers form what is called the fossil record. The fossil record is incomplete and biased. That means that many groups of organisms are rarely or never represented as fossils. Some kinds of organisms are much scarcer as fossils than when they were alive. Most animals that live today are insects or other land invertebrates, but they are very rare in the fossil record. The fossil record is biased in that animals with hard shells and skeletons are represented better than soft-bodied animals or plants (jellyfish, insects, algae, etc.). It is also biased in that land animals are poorly represented. Despite these limitations, paleontologists agree that the fossil record is adequate to study the past. How Do Fossils Form? Fossils occur in sedimentary rocks, namely rocks that formed by accumulation of small particles as sand or clay, or by chemical or biological precipitation of minerals like calcite or silica. The collection or set of fossils is called fossil record, which is a record of death in the past. In order for organisms to become fossils, three main conditions are necessary.  First, possession of hard parts like bones, shells or wood, though, exceptionally, soft parts may fossilize. Second, the organisms must be buried rapidly during or after death. What happens if rapid burial does not occur? Based on what happens in modern environments, dead organisms are scavenged by other organisms or decay and are destroyed by bacterial decomposition. The likelihood of preservation is extremely low without rapid burial following death. A third condition is determinant for fossilization: there must be an exchange of minerals between the buried parts and the sediment That exchange happens because of the presence of water in the sediment during burial. How Long Does It Take to Form a Fossil? The fossilization process cannot require millions of years. In fact, it may happen really fast. Observations in modern environments indicate that decay of fish, shrimp, jellyfish, sea stars, insects, etc. occurs in a few days or weeks after death, if they are not scavenged. If the three conditions for fossilization mentioned above occur, fossils may form relatively quickly. Paleontologists assert that organisms may become fossils in a span of time between a few hours to a few years. What Do We Learn from Fossils? Fossils tell us a story of life in the past. They may also tell us how an organism died, usually by rapid burial during a catastrophe. By examining the physical characteristics of the fossils, we may infer their original size, shape, method of locomotion, diet, and even behavior and ecological relations with other organisms and the environment in which they lived. The study of the enclosing sediment gives us important information to infer the environmental conditions in which the organisms lived or were transported and buried. For example, dinosaur footprints are common in many areas of the world, and the study of the prints and the sediment in which they occur gives us a glimpse about the size of these animals, their locomotion and behavior. Only in extremely rare instances fossils tell us something about their original coloration or the physiology of their internal organs. Do Fossils Occur in a Specific Order in the Geologic Layers? The geological record consists of layers, many of which contain fossils. These fossils do not occur randomly throughout the layers, but in a sequence that seems consistent in different localities across the planet. The sequence in which they occur may be interpreted differently depending on the worldview of the observer. One explanation is that the fossil record was formed by the catastrophic global Genesis flood, as written in the Bible. In a global flood, the lowest surfaces would be expected to be covered first with water and sediment. Since the lowest surfaces are the ocean floors, we would expect to find marine fossils to form before terrestrial fossils. As the ocean floors were covered with sediment, we might expect to find fossils of species from low-lying terrestrial areas, followed by fossils of species from higher elevations. This theory was first proposed by Harold W Clark[1] and is called the Ecological Zonation Theory. Several predictions of Ecological Zonation Theory are fulfilled in the fossil record. For example, the lowest layers with abundant fossils have only marine organisms, representatives of most of the body plans, or phyla, known from living organisms, as well as many types that are now extinct. The abrupt appearance of diverse types of marine animals at the bottom of the fossil layers is famously known as the Cambrian Explosion. Also, fossils of terrestrial organisms appear in a sequence that correlates reasonably well with increasing terrestriality (i.e., the degree to which an organism is fit for life on land). We would expect that species living in the first habitats to be destroyed would be least likely to have survived the flood and still be living. In general, this is what we find. These general patterns are consistent with Ecological Zonation Theory. However, there has been very little research on the theory, and much more research is needed. Does the Fossil Record Suggest Evolutionary Change? The fossil sequence shows us the sequence in which various types of organisms were buried, but it does not tell us how the fossilized organisms originated. The worldview of materialistic Darwinism and theologies such as theistic evolution attempt to explain the fossil sequence as a record of evolutionary change over long ages of time. Evolutionary theories explain some features of the fossil record, such as the sequence of first appearances of the vertebrate classes, and the gradually changing composition of fossil assemblages in some parts of the geologic column. On the other hand, it has been notably unsuccessful in explaining other features of the fossil sequence, such as the abrupt appearance of diverse animal forms in the Cambrian layers, a feature known as the “Cambrian Explosion.” The first fossils in the basal Cambrian layers show high complexity and diversity, something not predicted by Darwinian theory, but which fits well in the global Genesis Flood model. The pattern of abrupt appearance of fully formed and diverse species within groups is repeated on a less spectacular scale in other organisms such as dinosaurs, and flowering plants.Gradual evolution also fails to explain adequately the shortage of potential transitional links between the different types of organisms throughout the column. The majority, if not all, of animal and plant forms appear abruptly in the fossil record without known ancestors or intermediate forms. For example, bats, ants, dragonflies, cockroaches and many others appear in the fossil record without any apparent ancestors, and look much like their modern counterparts. This pattern of abrupt appearance does not fit models that invoke gradual evolution, and may fit better in a creation and global catastrophe model. Moreover, Darwinian theory fails to explain how changes in genetic information can produce new types of organs and body plans. Because of these failures, Darwinian theory is not a satisfactory explanation for the fossil sequence.', 'A recent article published by Olivier Lambert et al.[1] reports on the finding of a new fossil vertebrate in the Peruvian desert that has been named Peregocetus pacificus. The fossil was discovered in fine-grained sediments of the Yumaque Member of the Eocene Caballas Formation in the East Pisco Basin. From the very beginning of the article, the authors describe the fossil as a “cetacean”, a “protocetid cetacean”, a “four-limbed whale” and “the first indisputable quadrupedal whale record from the Pacific Ocean and the Southern Hemisphere.” Protocetids are a diverse group of extinct tetrapod vertebrates known from Europe, Asia, South and North America, and Africa, with long and strong fore and hind limbs that supported their body on land. It is thought that they also lived amphibiously as they have some traits that suggest they were adapted to amphibious life.The newly reported fossil consists of a partial adult skeleton of a protocetid “preserving the mandibles and most of the postcranial skeleton.” An examination of the skeletal parts of Peregocetus clearly suggests that this was a terrestrial animal with some capability to swim in water or walk in areas of shallow waters. The vertebrae and limbs are clearly designed to support the weight of the body on land. Tail vertebrae have bifurcated flat transverse processes, which are similar to those observed in terrestrial animals capable of swimming, like otters, and beavers. Since the finding of this fossil was first published in the scientific literature, numerous reports have come out in popular online magazines and science news with claims nearing the assertion that this is the perfect fossil link between a terrestrial artiodactyl the size of a large dog and fully swimming whales.[2] Other fossil protocetids have been found in Pakistan, so this specimen in Peru is remarkable because it is interpreted to show that land animals made their way from Asia to the Pacific coast of South America while in the process of gradually evolving into whales. Our experience in the study of fossils tells us to be cautious with these kinds of claims. First of all, the fossil skeleton found in Peru is, as the authors say, a terrestrial animal with amphibious capacity. Having traits indicative of amphibious lifestyle does not make a fossil an intermediate form. Several fossils of sea lions and seals have been found in rocks above the layers containing the Peregocetus pacificus.[3] Those animals are amphibious as well, and display a combination of adaptations for both terrestrial and aquatic lifestyle, as Peregocetus does. However,  we have modern species of sea lions and seals, showing that they represent a functional and stable body plan adapted to a specific lifestyle rather than intermediates in an evolutionary sequence. Because we don’t have a modern animal correlative of Peregocetus, some find it convenient to place it in an evolutionary sequence from land to water mammals instead of considering the alternative of functional design. But what about the presence of traits that seem to indicate a mixture of characteristics? Extinct animals often display mosaic traits, which are a combination of features typically found in different groups of animals. The bird Archaeopteryx and the amphibian Tiktaalik are two examples of mosaic fossils. The extant mudskipper (an amphibious fish) is also an example of mosaic animal. Rather than seeing these mosaic forms as transitional, they should be evaluated as representing specific combinations of behavioral/physiological adaptations. In the case of “transitions” from sea to land, the word “amphibious” applied to the mudskippers and Peregocetus must not be understood as a behavior or anatomy in evolutionary transition from one type of environment to another, but meaning a different and specific lifestyle that is independent of evolution. Having the capacity to swim does not make an animal a transitional form from land to water. Peregocetus was a terrestrial animal with the capacity to venture into the water. However, this capacity must have been somehow limited and very different from prolonged submergence or complex subaqueous motion. For the latter, mammals need to have a vertebral column with unfused vertebrae, as modern whales have. Peregocetus lacked such feature, showing fused sacral vertebrae. The article indicates that the first three caudal vertebrae “show unleveled anterior and posterior epiphyses, indicating that the tail was ventrally bent just behind the sacrum, leading to a tail not as horizontal as in fully aquatic cetaceans.” The concept of transition from land to a fully aquatic environment entails extreme changes in the behavior, anatomy and physiology of an animal. Many body systems would require a substantial overhaul with profound changes. The respiratory, circulatory, renal, and reproductive systems of fully aquatic animals would have to be very different from their putative land ancestors. How would the alleged transitional forms work? How would a transitional heart, kidney, or eyes and ears work? In a design perspective these adaptations are the product of intelligence. The genetic changes involved in going from a fully terrestrial or even amphibious animal to a fully aquatic animal like whales would have to be coordinated to a level that defies statistical imagination. A creationist perspective interprets Peregocetus as an extinct animal, like many others occurring in the sediments of the Pisco Basin, that has a unique combination of traits not commonly found in fossils. Its putative amphibious behavior needs not to be considered transitional in any sense. In the layers of the Pisco Basin, there are multiple fossil specimens of amphibious animals (sloths, sea lions, seals, crocodiles) that represent well documented stable body plans and ecological strategies. I suppose that if one assumes a priori the theory of evolution and the idea that cetaceans evolved from land animals, then finding a fossil like Peregocetus with a combination of land and aquatic traits fits the needs of the theory. But what if we don’t assume evolution? Then Peregocetus becomes just what it was: an animal that lived on land, derived from one of the many kinds that God created, that occasionally would venture into water to fish or bathe, and, in the case of our specimen, was carried over (alive or dead) by a water current until it sunk to the seafloor, to be buried in sediment.', 'Trilobites are the most abundant and diverse fossils found in the Cambrian Explosion. Their body fossils first appear at the base of Cambrian Series 2, which is the second of four divisions of the Cambrian sedimentary record. The abrupt appearance of phylogenetically diverse trilobites suggests a cryptic history of evolutionary development that left no record of body fossils in sediments below Cambrian Series 2, although some trace fossils from stratigraphically lower sediments are attributed to trilobites. This study analyzed inferred rates of evolutionary change based on the distributions of 115 morphological traits in 107 species of Cambrian trilobites. Most families of Cambrian trilobites were included in the study. Results showed that there was no evidence of unusual rates of change of traits in the fossil record of Cambrian trilobites. This was interpreted to show that the Cambrian Explosion, in which trilobite diversity originated, must have happened before the record of trilobite body fossils began, as it is not documented in the fossil record. The explosion of trilobite diversity was truly rapid, and probably was accomplished during the first stage of the Cambrian (Terreneuvian) rather than extending deep into the Precambrian. A modern-style marine biosphere must have existed during deposition of the lowest Cambrian sediments, followed by large scale evolutionary stasis in the rest of the Cambrian. Trilobites appear abruptly in Cambrian sediments, with 45 genera in 28 families and at least three orders appearing in the Cambrian Series 2 layers.1 No ancestors are evident in preceding layers. The usual explanation is that there was a long history of cryptic Precambrian trilobite evolution before the first fossils appear, with new types appearing gradually in the Cambrian. Paterson et al give a different explanation –trilobites appear in a burst of diversity and abundance that continues throughout the rest of the Cambrian layers. The abrupt burst of diversity indicates that the explosion had occurred before trilobites appear in Cambrian Series 2, not afterward as is commonly understood. The rapid and steady increase in diversity through the rest of the Cambrian suggests that no long history of gradual Precambrian development is needed. Instead, trilobites must have originated in the Cambrian but were not preserved until deposition of Series 2 sediments. The authors state: “We conclude that the Cambrian explosion was over by the time the typical Cambrian fossil record commences and reject an unfossilized Precambrian history for trilobites, solving a problem that had long troubled biologists since Darwin.” This does not seem to explain the problem of abrupt appearance at all – it makes the problem worse for evolutionary theory. It still fails to explain why trilobites appear abruptly in the sediments, with no evidence of evolutionary ancestors. The problem is worse now because the major burst of appearance of trilobite diversity is proposed to have occurred in a much shorter time than believed before, and still without any evolutionary ancestors. A better explanation may be that a diverse fauna of trilobites was created and the abrupt appearance of diversity is due to the abrupt onset of fossilization some time after the creation.', 'A new Lower Cambrian site in the Shuijingtou Formation of China’s Hubei Province has produced more than 100 genera of well-preserved fossils, representing at least 18 body plans.[1] More than half the species are new to science. Notably, the fauna includes numerous jellyfish, sea anemones, “mud dragons” (kinorhynchs), worms, and other soft-bodied taxa rarely preserved as fossils. The fauna is known as the Qingjiang biota, named after a nearby town and river. The newly discovered site is stratigraphically similar to the famous Chengjiang fauna, but strongly different in faunal composition. The degree of differences in the two faunas was unexpected, since the Chengjiang fauna has been extensively collected and studied. The uniqueness of the Qingjiang fauna is attributed to habitat differences – the Qingjiang site is interpreted as a more distal shelf habitat compared with the Chengjiang site. The Qingjiang biota may turn out to be the most diverse Cambrian fauna discovered to date. Discovery of this new fauna increases the diversity of animals in the “Cambrian Explosion,” a feature consistent with creation theory, but increasingly problematic for evolutionary theory. Rapid preservation is attributed to sediment gravity flows that transported some of the organisms downslope, burying them on top of other organisms living there. This is an interesting case where the faunas are different enough that scientists might be tempted to try to trace evolutionary ancestry from one to another, but their location in the same stratigraphic interval precludes that possibility. An interesting discovery is that the Qingjiang comb jelly has the same body plan as modern comb jellies This raises doubts about the recent interpretation of some Chinese fossils, referred to as “dinomischids” thought to show that comb jellies evolved from a polyp-like ancestor.[2] The ctenophore body plan was already in existence when the “dinomischids” were preserved. It is interesting to note that all Cambrian fossils are from marine habitats, close to or on the seafloor. During a global catastrophe, like the biblical flood, these communities would be highly susceptible to rapid burial by sediment gravity flows. Abrupt burial of the seafloor today would likewise bury assemblages of animals with disparate body plans, related ecologically but not phylogenetically. Segregation of species in different seafloor habitats appears to be a feature of both modern and fossil communities.']\n",

      "['\\nOctober 5, 2012\\nAlbert Einstein said his biggest mistake was in not predicting the expanding universe. He developed an equation in 1915 that described gravitational effects in terms of general relativity. Since everything in the Universe gravitationally attracts everything else, one would theoretically expect the Universe to collapse; however, we all observe that the Universe has not collapsed, so Einstein put an ad hoc repulsive force into his equation to make a steady-state universe possible. In 1929 Edwin Hubble suggested an expanding universe as another possibility. He observed an increasing red shift in light coming from more distant galaxies suggesting that everything in the Universe is moving away from everything else, and the further away it is the faster it’s moving apart. This seemed to point to some original explosion of matter from which we are still seeing the effects.The revolution in scientific thinking from a steady-state to an expanding universe took awhile to accept for philosophical reasons. An expanding universe pointed to a beginning for the Universe, a point in time before which science couldn’t explore, an effect without a cause, a Beginner to start things off at the beginning. Fred Hoyle and others preferred an alternative theory of continuous matter creation and ridiculed the expanding universe theory by calling it the Big Bang – a name that stuck. Eventually, however a predicted cosmic background radiation from the Big Bang was discovered in 1964 by Penzias and Wilson and the scientific community came to accept an expanding universe. Now, the three classic pieces of evidence for the standard Big Bang cosmology model are the red shift, the background radiation, and the observed relative abundances of the light elements assumed to have been created immediately after the Big Bang occurred.In the standard Big Bang model leptons (e.g., electrons) and quarks (constituents of protons) formed first. During the first three minutes, quarks grouped into protons and neutrons and the atomic nuclei of hydrogen and helium. After about 300,000 years the temperature of the Universe had decreased enough for electrons to attach to nuclei forming atoms. Then radiation was decoupled from matter and light was able to traverse large distances in the Universe. Finally, the atoms coalesced into stars and galaxies. Once a hydrogen star became massive and its interior became hot, the atoms were able to get close enough together to fuse into the heavier element helium. This fusion (that also occurs in hydrogen bombs) gives off tremendous amounts of energy that we see as starlight or sunlight and the process is governed by Einstein’s equation E=mc2. After all the hydrogen is burned to yield helium then carbon and the heavier elements up to iron, the star no longer has fuel to burn and it collapses. In the process of collapsing to a very dense neutron star, part of it also explodes as a supernova and the additional energy rapidly generates the heavier elements beyond iron up to uranium. The elements we find in our solar system and on the Earth are explained as the result of burning stars and supernova explosions and the atomic abundances seem to match well what would be expected from such processes.So how old is the Universe and the stars it contains? In the standard model, the Universe is about 14 billion years old and our Sun and Earth are about 5 billion years old. Some creationists are willing to accept this age for the matter of the Universe and solar system because they believe a gap may exist between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2 where God recently begins to create life on the Earth. Other creationists believe that the entire Universe is only a few thousand years old based on such verses as Exodus 20:11 that say, “For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth.” They explain the apparent age of the Universe as coming from God needing to create a working universe, or creating light in transit, or creating a universe where time behaves strangely due to general relativity. Both perspectives are held within the Seventh-day Adventist community.Although the standard model is widely accepted in the scientific community, it has its difficulties: (a) Science cannot yet explain why the Universe has more matter than antimatter. The standard model assumes that the early universe contained equal abundances of both, but now the Universe appears to consist almost entirely of matter. Perhaps some conservation laws were broken in the early Universe, but this doesn’t seem sufficient to explain the discrepancy. (b) The Universe needs to have a certain mass for it to exist as it does. The observed amount of mass is much less than theoretically needed, so unobserved “dark matter” has been postulated and a number of possible candidates for this dark matter have been suggested. (c) Evidence from “the edge” of the Universe suggests that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating, rather than slowing down. This seems to require some kind of repulsive force or “dark energy” similar to Einstein’s cosmological constant that he stated was his biggest mistake. (d) Perhaps the biggest difficulty is that cosmology is not standard science. Cosmology extrapolates further back in time and much farther away in distance than any of the other sciences. The Big Bang is a singularity where the laws of physics break down. Objectivity is lost because we are part of what we are observing. Non-intuitive theories are required to explain how the Universe works – general relativity for very strong gravitational fields where light bends and quantum mechanics at the atomic scale.A significant remaining question is: why does the Universe appear to be fine-tuned for its own continued existence and for the existence of life? For example, the mass of the Universe can’t be too great or it would collapse on itself, nor too small or it would expand forever without coalescing into stars and galaxies. Some have suggested that the mass must be exactly right to one part in ten to the fortieth power. As another example, the strong and electromagnetic forces must be finely balanced for the existence of both the light and heavy elements necessary for life. The fine-tuning is recognized in the scientific community and is accounted for by the anthropic principle or by multiverses. The anthropic principle states that the Universe must allow life to develop or else we wouldn’t be here to observe it. The multiverse idea suggests that many universes exist with different laws, and we happen to live in a universe where the laws make life possible. The creationist community would explain the fine-tuning as the result of God creating it to make life possible.Finally, if intelligent life exists on the Earth, does it exist elsewhere? The last few years have seen an extensive search for earth-like planets orbiting other suns besides our own, where the conditions would be right for other intelligent beings to exist. Hundreds of such planets have been discovered and possibly some have the right conditions to be inhabited. The Seventh-day Adventist community does in fact believe that other intelligent beings exist besides humans, and perhaps they could live on such planets.Ben Clausen, PhDGeoscience Research Institute\\n\\n', '\\nNovember 6, 2014\\nSeveral years ago my wife and I were hiking in Utah at Arches National Park. The area was desert, so it wasn’t easy to pick out the trail, but we saw these little piles of rocks. If there had only been a couple piles and the piles contained only a couple rocks, we wouldn\\'t have particularly noticed or at least would have thought it was just a natural coincidence. However, the piles contained several rocks, stacked on top of each other, and occurred on a line every 100 feet or so. The piles (cairns) appeared to be designed by humans, and we took them to represent trail markers.\\nThis article will describe evidence for what appears to be physical design on Earth, in the universe, and in the basic laws of nature. Some have used the examples of design as arguments for the God of religion as the intelligent designer; others have explained the design naturalistically. Some pros and cons of the arguments will be outlined along with cautions in using the arguments. Design in the universe is a reasonably good argument for an Intelligence behind nature; however, it is important to know the strengths when using the argument as well as some cautions. Each individual has a choice in how they interpret the evidence. As for me, I choose to believe that the God of the Bible is the Intelligent Designer and praise Him for his wisdom.\\nEVERYONE SEES DESIGN\\nEveryone recognizes design in nature. The question is how to interpret it: what is its source? what does it mean?\\nThe Greeks saw design in nature and used the golden ratio (that we can see in nature\\'s spirals such as the chambered nautilus) in building the Parthenon (Livio 2003).\\nThe founding fathers of science believed in a God of law and order and expected His creation to obey natural laws, to follow cause and effect relations, and to demonstrate design (Gingerich 1995). A number of these scientists used natural theology to demonstrate how intricately God had designed nature. A series of books was published in the early nineteenth century by William Pickering of London to provide evidence for the existence of God and examples of design by an all-wise Creator. They were titled the \"Bridgewater treatises on the power, wisdom, and goodness of God, as manifested in the creation\". William Whewell (1794-1866) wrote on: Astronomy and general physics considered with reference to natural theology. William Paley wrote on: Natural Theology: or, Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, Collected from the Appearances of Nature. His classic example is, \"The watch must have had a maker [who] designed its use, ... [and] every indication of contrivance, every manifestation of design, which existed in the watch, exists in the works of nature.\"\\nToday, a small but growing Intelligent Design group of scholars, with William Dembski as a leading proponent, find evidence for God in the design of the universe and in the design of living organisms. This group is providing rigorous criteria for making design inferences and elaborating the advantages of adopting intelligent design as a scientific research program. A number of them met at Biola University for a Mere Creation Conference, and eventually produced the book, Mere Creation: Science, Faith & Intelligent Design (Dembski 1998).\\nThis ability to see design is not restricted to those who are religious. Richard Dawkins (1987, p.1), the famous biologist and opponent of religion, says in The Blind Watchmaker that “Biology is the study of complicated things that give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose.” Stephen Hawking, the atheist physicist, says in A Brief History of Time that the beginning of the universe was designed for beings like us. In a later book, The Grand Design, he gives options for how this design could happen naturalistically. However, he still says, “Our universe and its laws appear to have a design that is both tailor-made to support us and, if we are to exist, leaves little room for alteration. That is not easily explained, and raises the natural question of why it is that way” (Hawking and Mlodinow 2010).\\nTHE WISH FOR DESIGN\\nEvidence of design for life counters the trend of the Copernican revolution where there is nothing special about this planet, and the Darwinian revolution that says there is nothing special about life. Being designed or planned for, not just some accident, gives an individual worth. Perhaps this is the reason for the disgrace attached to being an illegitimate child—one who is an accident and wasn\\'t planned. We want to have purpose.\\nEven though Steven Weinberg’s writings (1992) emphasize a lack of evidence for design, he points out some emotional reasons for wanting to believe in a Designer.\\n“It would be wonderful to find in the laws of nature a plan prepared by a concerned creator in which human beings played some special role. I find sadness in doubting that we will.” -- p.256\\n“The lessons of religious experience can be deeply satisfying, in contrast to the abstract and impersonal worldview gained from scientific investigation. Unlike science, religious experience can suggest a meaning for our lives, a part for us to play in a great cosmic drama of sin and redemption, and it holds out to us a promise of some continuation after death. For just these reasons, the lessons of religious experience seem to me indelibly marked with the stamp of wishful thinking.” -- p.255\\n“... religion did not arise in the minds of men and women who speculated about infinitely prescient first causes but in the heart of those who longed for the continual intervention of an interested God.” -- p.248\\n“I do not for a minute think that science will ever provide the consolations that have been offered by religion in facing death.” -- p.260\\nA DESIGNED EARTH AND SOLAR SYSTEM\\nThis Earth has a unique set of conditions necessary for life. According to Ward and Brownlee (2000) in their book, Rare Earth, planets with conditions necessary for life are rare in the universe. However, the on-going search for planets similar to Earth that could support life and for other intelligent beings (SETI) is engendered by the belief that although Earth is rare, it is not impossible to have such conditions elsewhere in the universe (Kasting 2010; Elkins-Tanton 2013).\\nHere are several examples of Earth’s unique features that make life possible: It rotates fast enough on its axis to give an equitable climate over much of Earth, but not so fast as to give a merry-go-round effect; The force of gravity on a much larger planet would be too great for humans to withstand its force but a smaller Earth with less gravitational attraction would not hold the atmosphere from escape; The molten nature of the interior of Earth creates a magnetic field that shields radiation from space; Earth has an abundance of the correct elements for life (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous), has the necessary atmosphere (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ozone), and has abundant water.\\nAnother frequently mentioned design feature of Earth is the need for plate tectonics to sustain life. A planet with moving plates makes possible the formation of continents and the recycling and concentrating of the elements and nutrients necessary for life at the surface of Earth by the processes of volcanism, erosion, and subduction.\\nThe unique properties of light in behaving both as a wave and a particle are important for life. Light can be reflected from a mirror and refracted, or bent, as it passes through a pair of glasses or a microscope lens. Light displays interference patterns as seen in the colors of a peacock wing or the hologram on a credit card. Some of the light spectrum is visible as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet, but most light frequencies are greater or smaller than those in the rainbow, just as most sound frequencies are smaller or greater than those from a piano. Beyond violet are sunburn-causing ultraviolet and the even more energetic X-rays. Below red is infrared felt as heat, microwaves used in ovens, and radio and TV waves. Light behaves as a particle of energy when it hits a solar panel, or in photosynthesis. It has mass and is bent in strong gravitational fields. It sets the speed limit for the universe, 300,000 kilometers/second. According to special relativity, this speed is a constant and everything else is relative. This high speed is the \"c\" in Einstein\\'s famous equation, E=mc2. When the mass \"m\" of even a very small atom is multiplied twice by the speed of light, it results in a very large amount of energy.\\nEarth\\'s fluid covering of air and water make life possible. The 20% oxygen and 80% nitrogen of Earth\\'s atmosphere are ideal. More oxygen would make fire control difficult, whereas less oxygen would be insufficient for life. Ozone, made up of three oxygen atoms, shields Earth from radiation coming from space. Air is \"strong\" enough to support an airplane and \"heavy\" enough to exert hundreds of pounds of pressure on our body surface. Water covers 70% of the planet. Its high heat capacity decreases Earth\\'s temperature fluctuations to a range acceptable for life. Unlike most substances, water expands on freezing; thus ice has a lower density than water and will float. If this were not the case, ocean basins would fill with ice from the bottom up. Water is as important for chemistry as light is for physics. It is a basic ingredient in biochemical reactions in our bodies, which are more than half water.\\nIn 1913 Lawrence Henderson, a professor of biological chemistry at Harvard University, wrote The Fitness of the Environment, providing numerous examples of design from chemistry. A number of properties of water are essential to life: specific heat, freezing point, latent heat of fusion, latent heat of vaporization, thermal conductivity, expansion before freezing, solvent power, dielectric constant, ionizing power, surface tension. The chemical properties of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are also essential to life: number, variety, and complexity of compounds, number, variety, and complexity of reactions, evenness and lack of energy change of the process of hydrolytic cleavage, chemical relationship of carbonic acid and water to the sugars, instability of the sugars, variety and reactions of the sugars, and on and on.\\nOur solar system is uniquely able to sustain life. The distance to the moon is ideal to provide tides that keep the oceans from stagnating, but not so large as to inundate the land areas. Earth\\'s orbit is nearly circular giving a constant distance to the sun and constant heating for Earth. The sun is the right distance from Earth to provide the necessary light, but not too much heat. Thus water can exist in abundance as liquid, as well as ice and vapor. The other giant planets are far enough away to not disturb Earth\\'s orbit, but yet close enough to protect Earth from life-extinguishing extra-terrestrial impacts. The solar system is in the ideal location in the galaxy: closer to the edge of the Milky Way galaxy stars have too few metals and closer to the center extreme energy processes occur.\\nA DESIGNED UNIVERSE\\nThe evidence for a beginning to the universe points to a beginner, or designer to get things started. Evidence for an expanding universe was observed in about 1930 by Edwin Hubble, but the idea did not take hold in the scientific community for more than thirty years because it seemed to point to the need for more than naturalism, the need of a “Beginner/Designer” (Gribbin 1976). This is a limit to scientific explanation because of an effect without apparent cause.\\nThe second law of thermodynamics is tied to this concept of a need for a creator. As formulated by Lord Kelvin, the law indicates that the amount of useful energy in the universe is decreasing. One can find local increases in useful energy, order, or design, such as in crystal structures, living systems, or the source of hydroelectric energy, but only at the expense of a greater loss of useful energy elsewhere. Kelvin believed that the universe required a Creator/Designer to wind it up at the beginning with sufficient useful energy: “a necessary diffusion of energy which only God Himself could restore to its original concentration (Smith and Wise, p.332).\\nAll of this leads to another concept of fine tuning in the Universe. If the Big Bang is assumed, the mass of the universe seems to be finely tuned. A little more mass at the early stages of the universe would have caused a rapid gravitational collapse; a little less mass would have resulted in too little gravitational attraction for clumping of matter into galaxies and stars. Much of the apparent fine-tuning seems to be related to a variety of fundamental constants that keep our universe powered. One of the most intriguing is the cosmological constant which remains difficult to explain within the naturalist construct.\\nIn 1915 Einstein put into his general relativity equation a cosmological constant. He assumed a static universe and needed this constant to provide a repulsive force to keep the universe from gravitational collapse. Once evidence for an expanding universe became available fifteen years later, the constant appeared to no longer be necessary. Einstein later lamented that inserting the constant was the biggest mistake of his life, for without it, his equation could have predicted an expanding universe. The cosmological constant needs to be exactly zero to 120 decimal places, an unexpected specificity that appears to require design. Weinberg (1992, p.223) recognizes that the constants of nature are well suited for the existence of life, but believes that a final theory would be able to prescribe values for these constants without any surprising coincidences. However, even he recognizes that a cosmological constant of exactly zero to 120 decimal places may still require some kind of anthropic principle for explanation. Though no longer needed for a static universe, the constant seems to be important for other reasons. Silk (2010) notes that the acceleration of the universe is produced by dark energy, but yet the governing cosmological constant is 10120 smaller than predicted by particle theory.\\nThe nucleus of an atom is another example where the forces of nature appear balanced beyond coincidence (Rees 2000). For most atoms, the nucleus contains many positively charged protons. Due to the electromagnetic force, like charges repel each other. How then do all the protons with the same charge stay inside the nucleus without flying apart? Apparently, some stronger force holds them together. For want of a better term, physicists call this force the \"strong force.\" To get the range of light-to-heavy elements necessary for life, the ratio between these two forces must be finely tuned. If the electromagnetic/strong force ratio were larger, protons would not be able to clump together. No heavier elements necessary for life, such as carbon and oxygen, would be stable. If the ratio were smaller, protons would too easily clump together to form the heavy elements, but no single-proton hydrogen atoms would remain for water or life. There might be plenty of gold and platinum, but no one to enjoy it.\\nHere are some other fine-tuned constants: (1) The mass of the neutron is slightly greater than the proton. If the relative masses were very much different than they are, the burning of stars and stellar evolution wouldn’t work. (2) The relative electron and proton masses need to be balanced in a particular combination, in order to have the chemical bonding forces combine to give the molecules important for life. (3) The number of positive protons and negative electrons needs to be balanced to cancel to zero, or else the electromagnetic force would dominate the much weaker gravitational force in the universe. (4) The great excess of matter over anti-matter is an unexpected and perhaps designed necessity after the Big Bang occurred. (5) Other examples are listed in The Creation Hypothesis by Moreland (1994) if you wish to read more. Notice that these fine-tuned forces are related to radioactive decay, so that a suggestion of change in decay rates would also suggest a change in the fine-tuning of the forces, thus making life impossible.\\nThe universe seems to be designed with an abundance of the right elements for life to exist – carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, etc. The relative abundances of the elements in the universe can be explained as due to stellar evolution. With a beginning material of hydrogen (single protons), stars produce helium and energy by combining protons into a helium nucleus with two protons and two neutrons in a process similar to how hydrogen bombs produce energy. Once the hydrogen is used up, three helium nuclei can combine to form carbon and the interaction of additional helium nuclei can make the heavier elements such as neon, magnesium, silicon, etc. up to iron. All of these reactions give off energy to fuel the sun or star, but elements heavier than iron require a different process that consumes energy. To form these heavier elements such as lead or gold or uranium requires additional energy from a stellar explosion called a supernova. (Chown 2001) If the elements were formed in this way, it lead to several questions: Was it by fiat or process? How long did it take? Is such creation continuing?\\nOne physicist working in the 1950s made a prediction in regards to the abundance of the elements. In general it would be difficult to get three helium nuclei close enough together all at the same time to make carbon inside a star. Two helium nuclei could group together briefly (with a 10-16 sec half-life) to make beryllium-8, but to easily add another helium nucleus would require carbon to have a resonance (an excited state) with just the right energy for combining beryllium-8 plus helium-4. Fred Hoyle suggested the need for this carbon resonance to a fellow physicist. Fowler discovered that in fact there was such a resonance and received a Nobel Prize for its discovery. Hoyle’s 1959 response: “I do not believe that any scientist who examined the evidence would fail to draw the inference that the laws of nuclear physics have been deliberately designed with regard to the consequences they produce inside the stars.” (Mitton 2011)\\nSUGGESTED NATURALISTIC EXPLANATIONS FOR DESIGN\\nThe evidence of fine-tuning has been explained naturalistically in various ways:\\n(1) Perhaps the fine-tuning of the constants is the only possible way that the laws of nature could exist (Weinberg 1992). Natural design happens all the time; take the intricate frost patterns for example, just based on the properties of water molecules.\\n(2) Perhaps it is not so much that the universe is finely adapted for life, but that life adapted itself to the universe through evolution, natural selection, and survival of the fittest. Organisms adapt to conditions, so perhaps other conditions than those on Earth could be adapted to by some form of life. The designer is just the environment.\\n(3) The Anthropic Principle is a suggested alternative to requiring a Designer (Carr and Rees 1979; Carter 1974; Barrow and Tipler 1986; Greenstein and Kropf 1989). The weak form of the principle states that: if the laws of the universe weren’t such as to allow life, we wouldn’t be here to notice, i.e., what we expect to observe is restricted by the conditions necessary for the presence of an observer. The Strong Anthropic Principle states that the laws of the universe necessarily must be such as to allow life. To many this explanation is lacking in appeal; it is like explaining why you can see an elephant in your living room by saying that you wouldn\\'t see it there if it wasn\\'t there.\\nThe anthropic principle suggests that the laws are the way they are by chance and low probability events happen all the time. For example, the chance of you having your parents, being born where you were, and having the characteristics that you have is very small, but it happened. Any calculations concerning the likelihood of chance events are based on assumptions and changing the assumptions can profoundly change the calculated chances. Many features are necessary for life to exist on a particular planet, but with many planets orbiting many stars, it is possible that some might have the right conditions. In The Grand Design, Hawking and Mlodinow (2010) say, “In the same way that the environmental coincidences of the solar system were rendered unremarkable by the realization that billions of such systems exist, the fine-tunings in the laws of nature can be explained by the existence of multiple universes.”\\n(4) Infinite time and space have been suggested as possible explanations for the chance coincidences. Infinite time could be provided by multiple universes in series. Infinite space could be provided by having multiple universes in parallel. Perhaps many different universes exist in different spaces with different physical laws and we just happen to live in the one universe with the laws that make life possible. A multiverse was suggested by Hugh Everett in the 1950s to remove the strangeness of the observer effect in quantum mechanics. A non-observable universe has been suggested beyond what we can see out to 14 billion light years. And general relativity suggests additional dimensions beyond the three space dimensions that we observe. The multiverse concept is interesting, but beyond what science can observe.\\nHawking explains the multiverse theory as Richard Feynman explains the quantum mechanical nature of light – just as light particles take multiple, in fact all possible, paths in the double slit experiment, the presence of “all possible universes” best explains the many options for choices in quantum theory (Bortz, 2010). M-theory allows 10500 universes, which would then allow for the possibility of different theories for each of the different universes. In The Grand Design, Hawking and Mlodinow (2010) explain that “according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence, or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously … [Hawking and Mlodinow] question the conventional concept of reality, posing instead a ‘model-dependent’ theory of reality … the laws of our particular universe are extraordinarily finely tuned so as to allow for our existence … quantum theory predicts the multiverse--the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.” A universal inflation is continuing and verified, but the spawning of bubbles of space-time to make the multiverse is not really science, because it cannot be tested.\\nPhysical laws can never provide a complete explanation of the universe. Laws themselves do not create anything; they are merely a description of what happens under certain conditions. Naturalistic theory would tell us not to confuse law with agency (Lennox 2010). “Science doesn’t do ‘why’ – it does ‘how’” as Feynman warned (Turner 2010).\\nCAUTION: DESIGN CAN BE A GOD-OF-THE-GAPS\\nThese naturalistic explanations have their problems, but an appeal to a supernatural being also has its problems as pointed out in the book 36 Arguments for the Existence of God by Goldstein (2010). The design argument can easily degenerate into a god-of-the-gaps argument (McGrath 2014; Luskin 2014): Anything humans can’t explain, must have been by God’s specific intervention.\\nBefore Sir Isaac Newton, God was thought to be directly responsible for making sure the sun rose every morning. Then Newton explained the motion of the sun, moon, and Earth using the laws of gravitation, while still attributing the laws to God\\'s design. Because of these natural laws, the observation of Halley\\'s comet in 1682 resulted in a predicted return in 1757; a yet to be observed planet (Neptune) was used to explain what would otherwise be slight gravitational irregularities in the orbit of Uranus. However, equations for a solar system with more than two bodies could not be solved exactly, and perturbations could accumulate and disrupt the order. So Newton felt that God (a god of the gaps) had to occasionally intervene to adjust the orbits because they were unstable and could become chaotic.\\nEventually it was found that the perturbations averaged to zero and planetary motions were stable, so that equilibrium in the solar system could be explained without some supernatural intervention. Pierre Simon de Laplace further developed the theory of cosmology and carried naturalistic determinism to the point of saying that the future behavior of the universe is absolutely predictable, given the present position and motion of every particle today. He believed that nature was so well designed, that there was no need for a \"god-of-the-gaps\". Tradition has it that Laplace gave his 1798 book, Mécanique Céleste to Napoleon, who said: \"M. Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe, and have never even mentioned its Creator.” LaPlace responded, “Je n\\'ai pas besoin de cette hypothèse” ... “I have no need of that hypothesis.”\\nNow theists seem comfortable accepting that God works through natural law to keep the solar system working without occasionally intervening in some “supernatural” way not amenable to scientific study. Over time the need for God seemed to decrease and this god-of-the-gaps design argument has fallen into disrepute. Thus, using the design argument as a god-of-the-gaps argument can be dangerous, because further evidence can refute the argument. Intelligent design arguments can do religion a disservice. One who makes a proof for God on the evidence of design today must be prepared for a possible disproof tomorrow.\\nCAUTION: DESIGN NOT REALLY A SCIENCE ARGUMENT\\nWhile design is evident to our senses, the appeal to a Designer moves beyond methodological naturalism to something more, something beyond. To be science, the design paradigm should present a better alternative working scientific model, rather than just attacking the standard cosmological model; however, that may be difficult because the design paradigm appeals to actions from outside the realm of repeatable, ongoing processes.\\nScientists trust the ongoing processes of nature just as all of us do in our everyday lives. Methodological naturalism works so much of the time that one has reason to trust the method: aerodynamic theory gets us around in airplanes, quantum mechanics theory gives us computers, and seismic theory can reduce the devastating effects of earthquakes and volcanoes. Since methodological naturalism works so well today, it makes sense to use it to explain the past with plate tectonics and stellar evolution, and there it also works amazingly well. Weinberg (1992, p.247) says, “... the only way that any sort of science can proceed is to assume that there is no divine intervention and to see how far one can get with this assumption.” Modern science developed in a Christian culture with many of the founding fathers being devout Christians, but the scientific principle had within itself the seed of atheism. The more that is understood of nature, the less need there seems to be for supernatural intervention to explain it.\\nActually, no one would want God to be continually intervening in unpredictable ways. If one expects God to be continually intervening, it would not be useful to study how the world works. There would be no incentive to try to find patterns and laws that govern on-going processes.\\nThus, design arguments are encouraging for the believer, but not so logically convincing for the unbeliever. That is not because most scientists are anti-God, at least not the ones I have worked with, but because it doesn’t provide a scientific explanation that is better than what science currently provides. Although one may believe that the universe was designed by a supernatural intelligence, that doesn’t make the design argument a scientific argument; it is more than that. In most cases, methodological naturalism’s use of natural law works well without a need for God to continually step in and adjust the universe, but that still leaves open the possibility that God designed and upholds those natural laws.\\nOTHER CAUTIONS WITH THE DESIGN ARGUMENT\\n(1) Design arguments are good, but not an air-tight case for a Designer. Although I believe that the universe, Earth, and life were designed by God, I am careful (often uncomfortable) about using design arguments. Looking at the natural world and universe as a believer, I can see the evidence for God’s direct design; but looking from a scientist’s perspective who uses methodological naturalism, I realize that other explanations are often possible and at times may be better (Young and Edis, 2004; Stenger 2011). The design argument is a good one, but it must be used carefully. Dependence on it can be like Israel depending on Egypt (Isa 36:6). Using design to encourage faith in the believer is well-intentioned and probably useful; using design as an anti-evolution polemic to convert the unbeliever has pitfalls.\\n(2) Design arguments often use marketing flair and rhetoric over academic rigor and full intellectual honesty. Arguments that need to be used carefully are: chance and incredulity (how could this complexity have occurred randomly?) and the cool factor (it’s so neat that God must have done it); they appeal to the non-scientist by not giving the full set of data and interpretations.\\n(3) The design argument may leave one with a God who designed the evil in the world, or at least allows it. Weinberg (1992, p.250) says, “Although I understand pretty well how brightly colored feathers evolved out of a competition for mates, it is almost irresistible to imagine that all this beauty was somehow laid on for our benefit. But the God of birds and trees would have to be also the God of birth defects and cancer.” Are the catastrophes in the universe designed – colliding galaxies, exploding supernova, and what at times appears to be chaos? Does God use stellar evolution to design the necessary elements for the universe? Did plate movement form the continents before life existed on earth? Are the catastrophic earthquakes and volcanoes directly associated with plate tectonics part of the design?\\n(4) Design arguments do not necessarily require the God of the Bible. They can also lead to various other metaphysical philosophies: New Age, Eastern mysticism, pantheism, theosophy, Hare Krishna, etc (e.g., Bhaktivedanta Institute). The design argument can also leave one with a deistic God – a God who sets things up correctly at the beginning to have the right fine-tuned constants, habitable planets, and life-developing properties and then just lets history take its course without further intervention. Projecting from methodological naturalism to philosophical naturalism in its extreme form is insufficient, but in some modified form it appeals to some, e.g., Howard van Till (1995).\\n(5) One cannot prove the existence of God and shouldn’t feel the need for science to prove the Bible. That may be like expecting proof of Jesus’ Messiah-ship by asking for signs and wonders (John 4:48). The design argument is not a silver bullet; humans have a choice. As observed by Blaise Pascal in his Pensées:\\n“We have an incapacity for proving anything which no amount of dogmatism can overcome. We have an idea of truth which no amount of skepticism can overcome.” -- frag. 406\\n“God wishes to move the will rather than the mind. Perfect clarity would help the mind and harm the will.” -- frag. 234\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe argument from design for God shouldn’t be oversold and both sides of the argument need to be recognized, but it can be a useful argument. As long as one realizes that both evolutionist and creationists overstate their case to make a point, one has lower expectations about delivery on a promise. It is easy to make pronouncements that \"man will never synthesize any organic molecules\", or \"man will never set foot on the moon\", but they only make the Christian appear a fool when they happen.\\nThe design argument is useful for the believer when evidence in the natural world is easily interpreted in harmony with a Designer; it is at least consistent with belief in the supernatural God of the Bible. The design argument can also be useful as an apologetic for the non-believer in at least suggesting that more than pure naturalism is needed.\\nPersonally, I believe that the “heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament shows his handiwork.” {Ps 19:1} The design that I see in nature is not proof for God – I have a choice –, but the evidence is good enough for me.\\n\\nBenjamin L.

John Barrow and Frank Tipler (1986) may have the most complete list of fine-tuning examples in their book The Anthropic Cosmological Principle. Hugh Ross (1995), a physicist and Christian apologist, points out some of the coincidences in The Creator and the Cosmos. Paul Davies (1984), a theoretical physicist, has written a much shorter version entitled The Accidental Universe. Martin Rees, a professor of astronomy at Cambridge University, along with John Gribbin (1989) have written a book along the same line, Cosmic Coincidences: Dark Matter, Mankind, and Anthropic Cosmology. It has a leaning toward New Age philosophy. Many other books and articles emphasize similar ideas from both an agnostic and a religious viewpoint (e.g., Heeren 1995; Templeton 1994; Bertola and Curi 1993; Leslie 1989; Robson 1987)\\nWalter Bradley (1994), a mechanical engineer previously chairing that Texas A&M University department, has given a talk entitled \"Scientific Evidence for the Existence of God\" at most of the Ivy League and Big Ten schools. He says it is \"one of the most exciting adventures of my life: challenging students and faculty alike to consider the overwhelming evidence from modern science for the existence of God.” In his talk, available online, he gives numerous examples of scientists with no religious motivation, who are emphasizing the evidence for fine-tuning:\\n\\nMany scientists who were not long ago certain that the universe was created and peopled by accident are having second thoughts and concede the possibility that some intelligent creative force may have been responsible. -- The Washington Post, describing an international conference held in Washington, D.C. in the late 1980s\\nThe equations of physics have in them incredible simplicity, elegance, and beauty. That in itself is sufficient to prove to me that there must be a God who is responsible for these laws and responsible for the universe. -- Paul Davies in Superforce (1984)\\nSuch properties seem to run through the fabric of the natural world like a thread of happy coincidences. But there are so many odd coincidences essential to life that some explanation seems required to account for them. -- Sir Fred Hoyle, the famous British astronomer and agnostic, in The Intelligent Universe\\nSlight variations in physical laws such as gravity or electromagnetism would make life impossible ... the necessity to produce life lies at the center of the universe\\'s whole machinery and design. -- John Wheeler, Princeton University professor of physics, Reader\\'s Digest (September 1986)\\n\\nFrancis Collins (2006), head of the National Institutes of Health, points out some of these examples of fine-tuning in his book, The Language of God, and concludes that they provide “an interesting argument in favor of a Creator.” Speaking of our fine-tuned universe, Nobel prize-winner Arno Penzias (Margenau and Varghese 1992, p.78) says that the universe has \"the very delicate balance needed to provide exactly the conditions required to permit life, and one which has an underlying (one might say \\'supernatural\\') plan.\"\\nPaul Davies (1992), in The Mind of God: The Scientific Basis for a Rational World, says:\\n\\n... There is no doubt that many scientists are opposed temperamentally to any form of metaphysical, let alone mystical arguments. They are scornful of the notion that there might exist a God, or even an impersonal creative principle or ground of being that would underpin reality and render its contingent aspects less starkly arbitrary. Personally I do not share their scorn. Although many metaphysical and theistic theories seem contrived or childish, they are not obviously more absurd than the belief that the universe exists, and exists in the form it does, reasonlessly. It seems at least worth trying to construct a metaphysical theory that reduces some of the arbitrariness of the world. But in the end a rational explanation for the world in the sense of a closed and complete system of logical truths is almost certainly impossible. -- p.231\\n\\nAnd in God and the New Physics, Davies says,\\n\\nThe delicate fine-tuning in the values of the constants, necessary so that the various different branches of physics can dovetail so felicitously, might be attributed to God. It is hard to resist the impression that the present structure of the universe, apparently so sensitive to minor alterations in the numbers, has been rather carefully thought out. – p.189\\n\\nJohn Polkinghorne (1986), mathematical physics professor at Cambridge University and Fellow of the Royal Society, who also trained for the Anglican priesthood, says:\\n\\nThe rational order that science discerns is so beautiful and striking that it is natural to ask why it should be so. It could only find an explanation in a cause itself essentially rational. This would be provided by the Reason of the Creator ... we know the world also to contain beauty, moral obligation and religious experience. These also find their ground in the Creator—in his joy, his will and his presence. -- p.79\\n\\nHeinz Pagels (1985), executive director of The New York Academy of Sciences and a theoretical physicist at the Rockefeller University, says that \"the anthropic principle is convenient, but it\\'s not science\". In a 1985 article he concludes with:\\n\\nThere does exist a line of thinking that is in direct competition with the anthropic principle. Edward Harrison, in his textbook Cosmology, advises his readers early on: \"We shall occasionally refer to the anthropic principle, and the reader may, if it is preferred, substitute the alternative theistic principle.\" The theistic principle is quite straightforward: the reason the universe seems tailor-made for our existence is that it was tailor-made for our existence; some supreme being created it as a home for intelligent life. Of course, some scientists, believing science and religion mutually exclusive, find this idea unattractive. Faced with questions that do not neatly fit into the framework of science, they are loath to resort to religious explanation; yet their curiosity will not let them leave matters unaddressed. Hence, the anthropic principle. It is the closest that some atheists can get to God.\\n\\n\\n', '\\nJanuary 31, 2016\\nSCIENCE AND THE BIBLE TALK ABOUT THE EARLY EARTH\\r\\nINTRODUCTION\\r\\nHow does one relate the standard scientific model to that presented in the Bible for the history of the Universe and Earth? This does not have an easy answer, but the Geoscience Research Institute will be addressing the question in several articles outlining the different parts of the geologic column. The standard divisions are: Precambrian with little life, Paleozoic with old life, Mesozoic with intermediate life, and Cenozoic with recent life. This series begins with the Precambrian and is based partly on Biblical Research Institute Science Council presentations and a field trip that occurred in 1993 at Glacier View Ranch south of Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.\\r\\nIn the standard chronology of Earth’s geologic history, the Precambrian part covers by far the largest fraction of time – 88% of the total. This spans the time from 4.56 Ga to about 0.54 Ga, where “Ga” stand for giga annum or billions of years ago. The standard scientific timeframe is included because many conservative Seventh-day Adventist academics are comfortable with long ages for inorganic matter and believe that only life was created recently.\\r\\nBecause this article attempts to cover so much material, the discussion is split into three parts. The first two parts present the standard scientific model, where in some cases various models are being suggested for one set of data. Design examples and creationist ideas are interspersed throughout these first two sections. The third part presents some additional creationist perspectives, although not much science is available. (To date young-age creationists have spent little time trying to explain the Precambrian in terms of a recent creation, with little speculation and less scientific research.) Here are the three sections:\\r\\n\\nThis first section summarizes the standard model for formation of the Universe, Solar System and Earth, Moon, oceans, continents, and plate tectonics. Brief references to the Universe, Sun, and Moon are included because what happens beyond Earth sets the stage for what happens on Earth during the Precambrian and in the Genesis 1 account.\\nThe second section describes Precambrian rock exposures, as well as the atmosphere, climate, and Precambrian life. Many illustrative pictures are included.\\nThe third section provides two perspectives suggested by creationists: (1) a young universe and life and (2) old inorganic material, but young life.\\nSome of the terms and concepts addressed here are too complex to do them justice in a single article. For this reason, many web links and references are included to provide more detail and a more complete understanding. The outline of the standard model is based especially on The Story of Earth by Hazen (2012). Additional information is available from a scholarly volume on Earth’s Oldest Rocks edited by Van Kranendonk et al. (2007). The web provides additional resources such as Encyclopedia Britannica, Michigan State University, Live Science, an historical geology textbook website, a journal devoted to Precambrian Research, a YouTube video, a good summary timescale, and a few cartoons.\\r\\nUNIVERSE\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\tThe NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope observes some of the most beautiful galaxies in our skies —  This little spiral, known as NGC 4102, has a different kind of appeal, with its tightly-wound spiral arms and understated, but charming, appearance. NGC 4102 lies in the northern constellation of Ursa Major (The Great Bear).\\r\\n\\t\\nIn the standard scientific model, the universe began at a Big Bang about 14 billion years ago. When an expanding universe was first suggested in about 1930, it was rejected by the scientific community because it seemed to suggest an effect without a cause pointing to an outside force like God. By the 1960s the Big Bang came to be accepted after the observation of microwave background radiation that could be explained by an initially hot, dense universe; however, scientists are still wondering (January 25, 2016) how the universe began and what came before the Big Bang. One creationist suggests that there is a crisis in cosmology (January 26, 2016).\\r\\nThe Big Bang created quarks, which coalesced into protons and neutrons that then formed atoms such as hydrogen and an environment where light could travel through space. These hydrogen atoms clustered into stars which became hot under gravitational pressure and started burning by nuclear fusion, just as in a hydrogen bomb. The “burning” meant combining four protons or hydrogen nuclei (1H) together into helium (4He).\\r\\nAfter the hydrogen had been converted to helium, the helium started combining so that three helium nuclei would combine to form carbon (12C), but carbon must have a certain excited-state resonance energy for this to work. Before this resonance energy was experimentally observed, it was predicted by Fred Hoyle as a necessary fact for nature to produce carbon by stellar evolution. Now that this resonance energy has been discovered, it has been suggested as an evidence for the intelligent design of the carbon nucleus, but the argument must be used with caution.\\r\\nAfter 12C is produced, heavier elements were formed by the addition of more 4He nuclei to make such elements as oxygen (16O), magnesium (24Mg), silicon (32S), and iron (56Fe). Atoms heavier than iron require an input of energy, so did not form until the extra energy from a supernova explosion was available to produce atoms of iodine, platinum, gold, mercury, lead, uranium, etc. These stellar explosions seeded space with these elements, many of which are just exactly the elements necessary for life.\\r\\nSOLAR SYSTEM AND EARTH\\r\\nRemnants of these stellar explosions formed clouds of gas and dust. One such nebular cloud with its mass all rotating in the same direction developed into our Solar System with a large central bulge forming the Sun and the remainder coalescing into planets.\\r\\nThis Sun is the ideal size for life on earth: if it were ten times larger it would burn too fast, and if it were ten times smaller it would not provide enough energy. During Earth’s early stages, the Sun had only about 70% of its current light output. This might suggest a much colder early Earth, but evidence for liquid water at that time indicates that that was not the case. This warmer-than-expected Earth has been explained by a greenhouse effect and by the Earth absorbing a much higher percentage of the Sun’s energy in the past.\\r\\nA solar wind blew the lighter gases away from the Sun to where the gas planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune now orbit. The heavier material remained closer to the Sun and accreted into meteorites and planetesimals (small planets) and eventually into the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. This formation of Earth occurred during the period of “heavy bombardment” by meteors in the Hadean (4.5-4.0 Ga). During this time the Earth differentiated into a denser iron/nickel core and less dense silicate mantle. A recent article (January 28, 2016) summarizes a book on the accretion and differentiation of the early Earth.\\r\\nAbout 10% of meteorites are iron that once formed the cores of planetesimals and 90% are silica rich chondrites that once formed their mantles. Present day examples of these early meteorites are most easily found in the Earth’s Antarctic ice fields and the Sahara desert. The largest known iron-nickel meteorite is the Hoba meteorite displayed near Grootfontein in Namibia.\\r\\nMOON\\r\\nIn the standard scientific model, the Moon formed within fifty million years after the development of the Solar System. It was once thought that the Moon formed by the breakup of the Earth, or by being captured from a solar orbit, or by accretion just as the Earth had. New data from Moon rocks in the early 1970s however, indicated that these theories were not satisfactory. The Moon lacked an iron core and volatiles like water, so its composition was too different from that of Earth.\\r\\nA new model that developed in the mid-1970s postulated that a small planet called Theia once occupied the same orbit as Earth, until it was captured by Earth and annihilated. The collisional debris thrown into space coalesced to form the Moon (see: Slattery, 1995; Choi, 2015). The impact from Theia was just right – not a miss, not too glancing, and not too head-on – and may have caused the Earth’s tilt of 23 degrees. Similar collisions may have caused Venus to rotate backwards and Uranus to rotate sideways. However, a recent article (January 29, 2016) suggests that the Moon was produced by a head-on collision.\\r\\nInitially the Moon is thought to have orbited the Earth at a distance of about 15,000 miles. At that time the Earth would have rotated on its axis every five hours, a solar eclipse occurred every 84 hours, and the Earth had monster tides. As the Moon moved away from the Earth at about 4 cm per year, the Moon orbited the Earth faster and the Earth’s rotation slowed due to conservation of angular momentum.\\r\\nOCEANS\\r\\nWater is ubiquitous in our Solar System in moons and planets, underground oceans and volcanoes. The Moon has subsurface ice and its rocks are 750 parts per million water. Venus had water early in its history, but it was lost due to heat from a runaway greenhouse effect. Mars has a metal core, a silicate mantle, an atmosphere, and a subsurface global ocean hundreds of feet deep. It lost its surface water, but evidence for its past existence is found in water-rich clay, braided stream channels, river valleys, and minerals formed from the evaporation of water. Earth is between these two planets at the ideal distance from the Sun, or “Goldilocks Zone.”\\r\\nSince the Earth is assumed to have formed from meteorites, the volatiles found in chondrites are expected to have existed in the early Earth – nitrogen, carbon dioxide, sulfur gases, and water. However, a large fraction of the expected volatiles seem to be missing, either lost to space from impacts such as Theia or deeply buried.\\r\\nOver the last thirty years it has been suggested that Earth’s deep interior may hold prodigious amounts of water. The mantle transition zone may contain as much water as nine times the Earth’s oceans and the lower mantle as much at sixteen times as much. Under the high pressures and temperatures deep in the earth, minerals incorporate hydrogen which, along with their oxygen, can produce water. This water content is evident in granitic magmas that commonly contain 1-4% water and volcanic lavas that cause explosive volcanism as at Mt St. Helens due to the explosive release of pressurized water vapor.\\r\\nAccording to the standard model, Earth’s early water came from the volatiles spewed out of volcanoes, so that shallow seas formed within a few tens of millions of years and oceans developed within 100 to 200 million years after Earth’s formation. The early oceans were saltier than today and apparently that salt has precipitated into salt deposits and evaporites – minerals formed from the evaporation of water.\\r\\nWater has the unique chemical properties necessary for life (Hazen, 2012). Among other properties, it is a solvent; it has high surface tension making capillary action in vascular plants possible; and it splits into hydroxyl (OH–) and hydronium (H3O+) ions important for acid/base pH reactions. Its high heat capacity decreases Earth\\'s temperature fluctuations to a range acceptable for life. Unlike most substances, water expands on freezing; thus ice has a lower density than water and will float. If this were not the case, ocean basins would fill with ice from the bottom up. It is a basic ingredient in biochemical reactions in our bodies that are more than half water.\\r\\nCONTINENTS AND PLATE TECTONICS\\r\\nOver the Earth’s history it has differentiated into a core, a mantle, and oceanic and continental crusts. The crustal plates are formed as magma rises from the mantle at spreading centers and volcanic arcs and destroyed as the tectonic plates descend back into the mantle at subduction zones. The differentiation and movement is due to gravitational effects on different density rock depending on their heat content and the arrangement of atoms in their minerals.\\r\\nThe Earth’s rocks are made up of minerals and the minerals are composed primarily of six types of atoms: oxygen, silicon, aluminum, magnesium, calcium, and iron. One usually thinks of the oxygen in the atmosphere, but 99.99999% of it is in the Earth’s minerals. Silicon is to inorganic rocks what carbon is to organic life, since both form four bonds with surrounding atoms. These oxygen and silicon atoms together (SiO2 silica) are the primary constituents of the Earth and its silicate minerals.\\r\\nThe early Earth was a hot magma ocean with the heat coming from the collision of meteor fragments, from gravity-induced tides, and from radioactive elements. The magma oceans cooled by conduction, convection, and radiation. The hot, early Earth differentiated based on density (in g/cm3) which is related to silica content. Higher silica content means lower density rocks, so rocks nearest the Earth’s surface are generally highest in silica. The differentiated Earth consisted of an iron core with negligible silica and a density of 10-13, a mantle with 45% silica and density of 3-4, and eventually a basalt crust with 50% silica and density 2.8-3.0. For comparison, later granitic rocks have a silica content of 60-75% and a density of 2.6-2.7. Seismology, the study of earthquake waves, is today able to identify a lower mantle made of the mineral perovskite with a density of about 4, a transition zone, and an upper mantle made of peridotite with a density of 3.1-3.4.\\r\\nDuring the first 50 to 100 million years, a basalt crust formed from 5% partial melting of the peridotite upper mantle. Rocks don’t have a single melting temperature and the first parts to melt have a higher silica content and a lower density than the remainder. The lower density basalt was more buoyant than the mantle and rose to the surface forming black volcanic islands in the Earth’s shallow seas.\\r\\nDuring the Archean from 4.0 to 2.5 Ga, plate tectonic activity began and the first small pieces of granitic continental crust called cratons formed. Life requires atmosphere, oceans, and land, but \"You can\\'t have continents without granite, and you can\\'t have granite without taking water deep into the Earth … So at some point plate tectonics began and started bringing lots of water down into the mantle. The big question is when did that happen?\" (see January 21, 2016 article). John Baumgardner suggests that catastrophic plate tectonics began at the Genesis flood.\\r\\nThe heat energy driving tectonic activity came from convection in the mantle, but the trigger may have been an asteroid impact. This differentiation to granite is part of the trend of elemental separation and concentration: the six major elements separated from hydrogen and helium by the solar wind; Earth’s silicate mantle separated from the iron core; basalt crust separated from mantle; water and other volatiles separated from rock; and now granite separated from basalt. The final result is low density continental crust made up of granitic rocks rich in silica, sodium, potassium, water, and trace elements. Its major minerals are quartz which eventually forms sandy beaches and feldspar which eventually breaks down to clay-rich soil.\\r\\nThe Proterozoic from 2.5 to 0.5 Ga is marked by the onset of modern plate tectonics, including volcanoes and earthquakes. Plate tectonic activity (Condie, 1998; Rino et al., 2004; Hawkesworth et al., 2010) caused the cratons to move around and combine to form the continents and at times a single super-continent. Pangea that formed at about 0.3 Ga is the most familiar example of a super-continent, but is more recent than the Precambrian. Older examples in the Precambrian include Rodinia (1.0-0.6 Ga), Columbia/Nuna (1.9-1.4 Ga), and a more conjectural Kenorland (2.7-2.5 Ga) and Vaalbara (3.1-2.8 Ga). Of these, Andrew Snelling briefly discusses Rodinia in his plate tectonic flood model. The supercontinent cycles are the subject of ongoing study.\\r\\nREFERENCES\\r\\n\\nCharles Q.

The A-type (anorogenic) granite was emplaced in the middle of a tectonic plate rather than at the edge. (Janasi, 2009)\\r\\nMany small outcrops of Precambrian rocks are exposed as basement rocks in other parts of the world such as Korea (Fig.5), Peru (Fig.6), Mt. Sinai (Fig.7), and southern Israel at Timnah (Snelling, 2010). Outcrops in the United States are found in places like northern Michigan, the bottom of the Grand Canyon, the Colorado Rocky Mountains (Fig.9), New Mexico (Fig.10), and the Transverse Ranges of southern California (Fig.11). Some of the first cratons to form at about 3.3 Ga were the Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe (Fig.12) cratons in southern Africa and the Pilbara and Yilgarn cratons in Australia. Some of the other three dozen cratons include: the Slave and Superior cratons in Canada, three in Greenland, and cratons in Scandinavia and the Antarctic.\\r\\n\\nFIGURE 5.

Precambrian (2.6 Ga) granitic rock of the Zimbabwe craton as seen from Cecil Rhodes grave in Matopos National Park near Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.\\r\\nAfter the cratons formed, they eroded to produce sedimentary deposits between them and some collided due to early plate tectonic motion. The collisions produced volcanic activity, granitic intrusions, and metamorphism of the sediments that often resulted in green rocks. These granite-greenstone mobile fold belts are common between various cratons exposed on the continents. Some volcanic rocks intruded under water forming pillow structures, e.g., in Russia (Fig. 13), South Africa (Fig. 14), and Michigan (Fig. 15). Other volcanic rock resulted from mantle melting at especially high temperatures yielding the uniquely high-magnesium komatiite, named after the Komati River (Fig.16) in South Africa; one good example of komatiite comes from western Russia (Fig.17)\\n.\\r\\nFIGURE 13. Basaltic pillow lava of the 2.8 Ga greenstone belt in the Karelian craton near Kostomuksha, Russia close to its border with central Finland.

Komatiite lava of the 2.8 Ga greenstone belt close to the location for Fig. 13. The common and distinctive spinifex texture displayed here consists of bladed crystals of the mineral olivine. It is the result of rapid crystallization of liquid lava at the margin of a flow. Komatiite is an ultramafic mantle-derived volcanic rock which means that its composition is close to that of the early earth and has differentiated little from that. It is generally restricted to rocks of Archean age when the mantle may have been as much as 500°C hotter due to residual heat from planetary accretion and a greater abundance of radioactive elements. The higher temperatures resulted in greater partial melting of the mantle giving a different geochemical signature in the extracted lava. (Peltonen et al., 2008, p.98, stop 6.11)\\r\\nGranitic magma was intruded underground to form chambers as in Namibia (Fig. 18), to break up the host rock as in eastern South Africa (Fig. 19), and to mix with host rock as near Cape Town (Fig. 20). Igneous, magmatic activity associated with craton movement produced large dikes of low silica rocks such as the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe and layered igneous intrusions such as the Skaergaard in Greenland and the Bushveld Complex in South Africa that are important sources of platinum group elements. Metamorphosed sediments include sandstone, limestone, and shale, with turbidites in South Africa (Fig. 21) as one example. Other examples of fold belts include: the several 0.9-0.5 Ga Pan-African fold belts in Zambia (Fig. 22) between the Congo and Zimbabwe cratons that are a major source of copper, the 3.5-3.2 Ga Barberton granite-greenstone complex in South Africa between the Zimbabwe and Kaapvaal cratons that displays greenstone rock (Fig. 23), and the 3.8 Ga Isua Greenstone Belt in Greenland that is one of the oldest.\\r\\n\\nFIGURE 18.

The Damara belt sediments were deposited in between rifting, then convergence, of the Congo and Kalahri cratons after which they were metamorphosed and intruded by magma.

After cooling and uplift, the granite and metamorphic rocks were eroded to a peneplain on which the Ordovician Cape Supergroup was deposited that now forms Table Mountain. The Sea Pont contact was made famous by Charles Darwin’s observations published in 1844. For more information, see University of Cape Town and the creationist, Tas Walker.\\r\\n\\nFIGURE 21.

The sausage-shaped structures or boudinage (arrow) are due to pinching of the layers during high pressure metamorphism. (Moyen et al., 2007, p.56, stop 5.4.c)\\r\\nNumerous impact structures are found in the Precambrian such as the large Vredefort Dome (Fig. 24) in South Africa formed at 2 Ga and the Sudbury structure in Ontario, Canada formed by a 10-15 km bolide at 1.8 Ga.\\r\\nIn many places an unconformity exists between the Precambrian rocks and the fossil-bearing Cambrian sediments above them, e.g., in Colorado Springs (Fig. 25). However, in a few places the unconformity in the sedimentary record may be lacking, e.g., in Morocco (Schmitt, 1978) and Newfoundland (Hutchinson, 1962; Narbonne et al., 1987; Brasier et al., 1994).\\r\\n\\nFIGURE 24. Fracture filled with pseudotachylite breccia in a slab of 3.3 Ga Vredefort granite in one of the pillars of the Johannesburg airport, South Africa. The fracture is interpreted to be the result of a catastrophic meteor impact that brecciated the granite, briefly fluidizing part of the rock before solidifying to the pseudotachylite black matrix. The 2 Ga meteor impact is the oldest preserved such structure on Earth. The 10-15 km large meteor formed a crater 250-300 km wide and 5 km deep causing a magnitude 14 seismic event. The present-day Vredefort Dome 120 km southeast of Johannesburg is a semicircular range of hills about 80 km in diameter that upturned some 20 km of rock layers.

A banded iron formation (BIF) of the Negaunee Iron Formation located at Jasper Knob, Ishpeming in the Marquette District of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The 2 Ga BIF consists of folded, alternating bands of gray specular hematite (Fe2O3) and red, iron-stained cherty quartzite (SiO2) often called jasperite. The layering has variously been interpreted to result from alternating cycles of oxic (oxygen present) and anoxic (oxygen absent) conditions in the oceans, where iron was oxidized (to Fe3+) and precipitated to form a red layer and then not oxidized (remaining as Fe2+) to give a gray layer, respectively. One of several theories suggests that the first photosynthesizing bacteria produced the oxygen which oxidized the iron. BIFs are often mined for iron ore.\\r\\n\\nFIGURE 27. Kostomuksha iron deposit is part of the 2.8 Ga greenstone belt close to the location for Fig. 13. This deposit consists of volcanic-sedimentary rock and shales. (Peltonen et al., 2008, p.96, stop 6.7)\\r\\n\\nFIGURE 28. Stromatolites in the 2.2 Ga Kona Dolomite (a magnesium limestone) on US 41 across from the Michigan Welcome Center near Marquette in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The domed layering is interpreted to result from sticky mats of cyanobacteria trapping sedimentary particles in a seasonal pattern or as the result of periodic flooding.\\r\\nA second great oxidation event occurred in the late Precambrian, when oxygen built up from 1% to 20%. This may have been due to phosphorous-driven algal blooms or feedback between microbes and clay minerals. The current concentration of 20% oxygen in the atmosphere is ideal: less would not be sufficient for complex, active animals and more would make it difficult to keep fires under control.\\r\\nCLIMATE\\r\\nEvidence for cooling events are found in the Precambrian at 2.9, 2.4-2.2, and 1.4 Ga, but evidence for glaciation is especially prominent near the end during what is called Snowball Earth. This evidence comes from rocks scratched by glacial movement, moraines of jumbled rocks carried by glaciers, and rocks called tillites that are dropped from glaciers. A seminal paper (Hoffman et al., 1998) called “A Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth” described tillites from the Skeleton Coast of Namibia suggesting that glaciers occurred at sea level near the equator which would indicate that the entire Earth had frozen over. Others have advocated a less extreme version with the Earth not totally frozen over, resulting in a slush ball instead of a snow ball.\\r\\nThe end-Precambrian cooling events are considered to be part of a cooling/heating cycle resulting from varying carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The glacial climate resulted from massive blooms of photosynthetic algae that took CO2 out of the air and removed the greenhouse effect. A buildup of white snow and ice reflected the Sun’s heat back into space giving positive feedback to the cooling. The rapid growth of algae concentrated isotopically light carbon leaving isotopically heavy carbon to be incorporated into contemporaneous limestone deposits at 0.79-0.74 Ga. Later when microbial activity slowed down, CO2 began to build up in the atmosphere resulting in a greenhouse effect and causing the carbon isotopes in limestone to become much lighter. These limestones deposited at the end of the glacial cycle and above the glacial deposits are called “cap carbonates.” This snowball/hothouse cycle probably occurred three times around the 0.73 Ga Sturtian glaciation, the 0.65 Ga Marinoan glaciation, and the 0.58 Ga Gaskiers glaciation.\\r\\nPRECAMBRIAN LIFE (images and descriptions)\\r\\nIn the standard science model (Schopf, 1983; Mesler and Cleaves, 2015), living organisms developed in the Archean with the first evidence for bacteria found at about 3.5 Ga. It is true that complex biomolecules are ubiquitous and are found in hot undersea vents, acidic streams, boiling pools, frozen Antarctic rocks, and stratospheric dust particles. In fact, half of Earth’s biomass lies miles below its surface. The building blocks of sugars, amino acids, and lipids can easily be formed by ultraviolet radiation, or violent ionizing radiation from lightning, or gentler oxidation-reduction reactions. These building blocks can even be assembled into macromolecules. Thomas Gold and others have suggested that methane and petroleum biomolecules may be abiogenic and come from deep in the earth, instead of being produced by living organisms.\\r\\nHowever, making only right-handed or left-handed molecules is a “daunting challenge” and developing self-replicating molecules is the “greatest enigma.” (Hazen, 2012) It has been variously suggested that organic molecules formed on mineral surfaces, or in a lipid world, or in an RNA world. Although many scenarios have been suggested for developing life from non-life, none are very convincing.\\r\\nThe most prominent evidence for life in the Precambrian are stromatolites apparently formed from microbial mats. These concentric geologic structures are interpreted to result from single-celled organisms growing in sheets that catch sedimentary particles upon which the next mat of bacteria grows. Modern day examples of these are found in Shark Bay, Australia. Examples from the Precambrian are found in the bottom of the Grand Canyon (Wise, 2005), in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (Fig. 28), in southern Africa, and many other places.\\r\\nEvidence for multicellular life is not found until the end of the Precambrian in the 0.64-0.54 Ga Ediacaran (formerly Vendian) period. Soft-bodied fossils displaying symmetrical impressions were recognized from 0.58 Ga rocks in Ediacara of southern Australia. Most remarkable are the 0.63 Ga Doushantuo formation fossils of southern China that display clumps of cells interpreted to be animal eggs and embryos.\\r\\nAfter the Precambrian, living organisms radiated rapidly in what is called the Cambrian explosion of trilobites, clams, brachiopods, bryozoans, sponges, horn corals, and many other new life forms. One can see the exact layer where this abrupt change from Precambrian to Cambrian occurs in Morocco. The Burgess Shale, made famous by Stephen Jay Gould’s book Wonderful Life (1990), is another prime example of this explosion of life forms.\\r\\nREFERENCES\\r\\n\\nAndrew P. Barth, Joseph L.

To one of those newly-discovered extra-solar planets the media get enthusiastic about when water has been detected there?Before you answer these questions remember that, beyond the presence of water, many other conditions must be fulfilled before any planet can support the continued existence of life as-we-know-it, human life.Over the last 40 years or so, astronomical studies have taught us that our life on Earth is dependent on a number of physical and other conditions far beyond just the presence of water. The majority of almost two hundred conditions refer to the necessary characteristics of our planet itself (temperature, chemical composition, stability, etc.) as well as to the properties of, and our location in, our Milky Way galaxy (are there nearby planets, sources of harmful radiation, etc.?).These conditions include the following: Life on Earth requires a “just right” distance from our reliable source of energy, the sun. Earth’s chemical composition must contain those chemicals that are the main building blocks of human life: oxygen to breath, calcium to build skeletons, carbon to build carbohydrates and, together with hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus, to make DNA. Earth needs a reasonably stable climate to allow food production to proceed along largely predictable lines; our Moon provides that stability for Earth’s rotation axis and its seasons. Our planet must not be too close to the centre of the Milky Way where deadly high-energy radiation would destroy life.In fact, even the universe as a whole plays an important role in the habitability of our planet. This includes the almost perfect electrical balance between positively and negatively charged particles to ensure that the universe does not expand too fast for stars and planets to form. The word “perfect” in this sentence means an accuracy of 1 in 1037 [this is a 1 followed by 37 zeroes!]. A similar balance governs the mass density of the universe which should not vary by more than 1 in 1060; too high and the universe would have collapsed long ago, too low and the universe would expand too fast for galaxies, stars and planets to form. No wonder we talk about these specific conditions as ‘fine-tuning’!The large number of requirements and their often narrow limits outside of which life could not exist already tell us that it may be difficult to find all of them fulfilled at a large number of different locations in the Milky Way. Add to this the fact that what we know about any extrasolar planets is still very rudimentary, and our search becomes like the one for a needle in a haystack.Since Earth offers a successful habitat for many life forms, in a first approach we should focus on Earth-size planets in extrasolar planetary systems: the distance from their star, the presence of water, the nature of its atmosphere, etc. For each host star these conditions are only fulfilled in a fairly narrow zone around it inside of which the planet must be revolving. This zone is called the Circumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ) of that star. It will be farther from a hotter star and closer to a cooler star (Fig. 1).Fig. 1: CHZ (green) around three different stars; red zones are too hot, blue zones are too cold for life (courtesy NASA).Thus, our search for suitable planets must first focus on finding suitable host stars, preferable a little less massive than the sun. Such stars are known as red dwarf stars, which constitute the overwhelming majority of stars in the Milky Way. The next step is to find small, i.e., Earth-size planets that are most likely to be rocky and have a suitable atmosphere. However, small planets are much harder to detect than their giant gaseous neighbours.The temperature of the star and its planet’s distance from it tell us whether we can expect to find liquid water. In a few cases the planet’s atmospheric composition can be derived. Surely, before moving to any exoplanet, we want to know many more details that are not easily obtained. Therefore, even the simple question about the number of possible exoplanets fit for human life will probably not be answered today or tomorrow.Because of the number of conditions to occur simultaneously, we do not expect to find many habitable exoplanets. The universe may turn out to be a rather inhospitable place for human life. Earth, if not unique, could well be one of a very small number of favourable planets. Considering the huge amount of fine-tuning required for a liveable planet, we should contemplate the possibility that the Creator of the universe has had a special purpose for creating Earth and its inhabitants, and that Earth’s uniqueness is a result of design rather than of accident.Mart de Groot, PhD,  has been both an astronomer with 40 years of research experience and a pastoral minister for 16 years thereafter\\n\\n', '\\nJanuary 11, 2018\\nEinstein’s general theory of relativity was published in 1915. It again made headlines in 2017 with two major reports about gravitational waves that further confirmed the theory’s last remaining major prediction. On October 3, the detection of gravitational waves from coalescing black holes was awarded a Nobel Prize. On October 16, the observation of correlated gravitational and electromagnetic (light) waves from the merger of two neutron stars was announced.Artist\\'s concept of two black holes on their way to becoming one (Image credit: NASA)Gravitational waves are distortions in space-time that radiate like light waves from a lamp, sound waves from a speaker, or water waves from a stone dropped in a pool. The distortions are caused by some of the most cataclysmic processes in the Universe, such as colliding black holes, coalescing neutron stars, and collapsing stellar cores that result in supernovae. In the 1970s, indirect evidence for gravitational waves came from measuring the orbital period of binary neutron stars. In 1979, the U.S. National Science Foundation funded research for more direct detection of gravitational waves. As a result, the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) developed the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) that can detect space-time oscillations that are thousands of times smaller than the nucleus of an atom. The kilometer-size detectors are located in Livingston, Louisiana and Hanford, Washington. Additional information about gravitational waves and their detection can be found in:\\nScience ---\\nScientific American ---\\nNational Geographic ---\\nThe first direct detection of gravitational waves occurred on September 14, 2015, when LIGO physically sensed distortions in space-time that lasted a fraction of a second. The passing gravitational waves were generated by two colliding black holes 1.3 billion light-years away. Since then, three other detections of black hole mergers were made on December 26, 2015, January 4, 2017, and August 14, 2017. The last observation was made by the two LIGO detectors as well as by a third detector in Italy called Virgo. The 2017 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to three physicists \"for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves.\" Over forty years ago, Kip Thorne at CalTech and Rainer Weiss at MIT outlined details of the necessary interferometers. Since 1994, Barry Barish of CalTech has helped lead out in constructing the LIGO facilities and establishing the LIGO Scientific Collaboration. Additional news about this discovery and the resulting Nobel Prize can be found at:\\nPress Release: The Nobel Prize in Physics 2017 ---\\nAmerican Physical Society ---\\nCNN ---\\nBBC ---\\nOn August 17, 2017, gravitational waves from the merger of two neutron stars 130 million light-years away were observed for almost two minutes. The directional information from the two LIGO detectors and the Virgo detector made possible the correlation of these gravitational waves with electromagnetic light waves from a galaxy in the constellation Hydra. The seconds-long gamma ray burst of electromagnetic waves was detected by the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope. Because a neutron star is extremely dense, with a mass similar to that of our Sun but a diameter of only a few miles, a gamma ray burst can contain as much energy as the Sun emits in a trillion years. Dozens of other telescopes tracked the “afterglow” of the explosive neutron star merger at x-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio (electromagnetic light) wavelengths. The results were announced on October 16 and published in a paper with more than a thousand authors, including a Seventh-day Adventist physicist at Andrews University.The announcement included several major news headlines: Both gravitational waves and electromagnetic (light) signals were detected from the same source. The speed of gravitational waves is the same as the speed of light, as predicted by general relativity. Since all gravitational wave signals from neutron star mergers would have the same intrinsic “loudness”, such signals can eventually be used to estimate the distance to merger-containing galaxies, and thus the Hubble constant and the expansion rate of the Universe. The kilonova neutron star merger rapidly produced elements heavier than iron for a total mass equivalent to 10,000 Earth masses.

      "['Most nature documentaries include some language that refers to an underlying naturalistic understanding of origins. They convey the idea that the deeply textured behaviors and interactions of the biological world emerged from impersonal physical necessities and a really long chain of purposeless chance events. However, the recently released nature documentary “The Riot and the Dance” breaks this common pattern in a refreshing way. Instead of suppressing the undeniable richness of meaning in nature, this film embraces with beautiful consistency a simple premise from its very start: God is the Maker of all there is and we resonate with other living beings because we all are the expression of His design and creativity. This bold choice sets this movie apart from classic nature documentaries and provides the foundation for the exploration of different habitats and their inhabitants. In speaking of other creatures, biologist Gordon Wilson, the narrating voice of the film, invites us to “see them truly as gifts, as miracles.” With reference to the redwood forests of the Pacific NW of the US, he remarks: “God has been using starlight to craft wooden towers older than the modern world. If He spared 2,000 years to shape something, can we spare the time to give it a glance?” In a moment of rare lyrical intensity, Wilson comments on a close up shot of a wild puma saying: “Look a puma in the face: really look. Know that its symmetry and grace was invented from nothing. Who can do such a thing? Only your Father.” What a joy to hear this kind of language punctuating quality videography of different aspects of the creation. Openly embracing a theistic explanation for the origin of our world and the life that thrives in it has three direct consequences, clearly demonstrated in the movie: 1) First, it encourages wonder in the observer, because living creatures are received as works of art rather than machinery assembled by evolutionary engineering. This way of doing biology is not scared of poetry, and seeks to transcend the mere observation of the constitutive components of reality to spring into an act of celebration; 2) Second, it establishes a strong sense of responsibility founded on the traditional Christian understanding of creation, where humans are called to be keepers of this world. In Wilson’s words, “God has given us dominion and we have to take that charge very seriously.” The movie models an excellent example of how this responsibility requires mindful participation and continuous interrogation and can be fulfilled with playfulness and innocence rather than greed or disinterest; 3) Thirdly, it forces us to acknowledge the existence of tension and dissonance in the natural order when compared to the divine ideal revealed in the Scriptures. Nature is not only the source of thrilling wonder but also of perplexing realities not easily accounted for. This ambiguity is exactly what the title of the film, “The Riot and the Dance,” intends to convey. Something in the creation is not as it should be and we are puzzled by it, although we cannot mistake its evil nature. The narrative trajectory of the movie starts with a brief opening section where Wilson introduces himself, and continues with a journey of exploration of different habitats and animals, covering local (US) and exotic (Sri Lanka) examples. A concluding section focuses on snakes, a common icon of natural evil, and after the closing credits there is an extensive appendix of interviews with Wilson and the film director (Wilson’s nephew), Ken Ham of Answers in Genesis, author Eric Metaxas, and Christian hip hop artist Propaganda. The major themes addressed throughout the movie are exploration and enjoyment of nature, environmental stewardship, and natural evil. I really liked that the nature sequences in the film are interjected by brief segments where Wilson speaks directly to the camera to introduce the discussion of those themes. However, some of the transitions between different habitats felt a bit disconnected, not always contributing to the construction of a compelling overarching story. The quality of the images and the spectrum of animal behaviors portrayed was very good. For me, some of the most impressive shots were close-ups of the scales of several reptiles caught by Wilson, showing beautiful coloration patterns. The high resolution shots zooming in on the geometric arrangement of the scales covering the skin of these animals certainly made me think of them as incredible living masterpieces. The closing interviews segment of the documentary helped to understand some of the history behind the making of the film, but was very different in style and made the movie perhaps too long. This did not leave the same flavor in our palate that had been constructed in the beautiful movie proper. When it comes to the deeper reflections elicited by the film, I can think of two aspects that I would like to discuss more with Wilson to understand further his wisdom and perspective. The first is the possibility that heightened appreciation for the creation could translate into a sort of “nature worship.” If evolution has no place for intelligent design in nature, at the opposite side of the spectrum is a world where every minute detail is assigned incomparable value. Could this result in a posture towards the creation that is almost afraid of interaction and engagement for fear of disrupting a divinely ordained balance? To be fair, Wilson does not fall into this trap and projects a well-centered understanding of human rulership that is gentle and passionate, but not at all passive. Director Andy Wilson explains in the final interview how he wanted to avoid the approach of other documentaries that “treat the animals as if they are sacred: the animals must not be touched, the animals take precedence over mankind.” However, in a scene where Wilson is crossing a river, we see him let a land leech crawl up his leg and draw a good sip of blood while he comments “Behold, God and I provide.” At times, I wonder if rather than turning back to God for all we observe in this world we should be impressed by how bad things have gone and read among the lines of nature the story of a cosmic conflict, elements of which we need to call out for what they are: not good. And again, Wilson seems to capture this tension by oscillating between the poles of wonder and appreciation but also statements affirming that “this is not how the world was meant to be, this is the result of the fall. It is more riot than it is dance.” However, he also appears to embrace the world as it is: “How much of this world does God love? How much has He given to us? The answer is the same: all of it. Every prickle and every pebble, every storm and every breeze, every insect and every lizard.” There is something tragic in the scene where a crested serpent eagle engages in an extenuating fight to kill a land monitor, but geckos preying on termites are apparently ok: God “makes them desperately want what He has already arranged to give them. Feast little lizards.” Maybe this tension is indeed where we should situate ourselves as Christian scientists in reading the message of the world around us.            The second aspect, connected to the first, is the stated desire to bring into the fold of this movie the narration of “Christian evolutionists.” Director Andy Wilson offers that “all of us should be able to look at the world and love what God gave us. Part of the goal of the film was not to have a debate movie where Christians fought with each other, but a film to celebrate what we all agree God gave us and then have some intermural debate about how He gave that to us.” But are animal death and predation part of “what we all agree God gave us?” If God uses natural selection to play His music, one would look at the hardships of animal life in a reverent rather than contrite and troubled way. But Wilson does promote throughout the movie the concept of the fall and the curse, and not only a spiritual one, but one that materially affected the biological world. He goes as far as to explicitly connect all the biological suffering to the results of our human choice: “Predator-prey, parasite-host, all these things are the result of the fall. The creation needs redemption.” “When man fell, so did the world, now death is something that we all share.” “Everything here is groaning against death because of our fall.” Therefore, it would be interesting to see how he sees that this approach can square with the perspective of a “Christian evolutionist.” I was very grateful for and resonated with the perspective adopted in this movie. It is encouraging to see that new quality documentaries are being produced that embrace a language and a worldview in which many of us breathe and move. This film also provides a great opportunity to invite a skeptic friend to engage with a different way of looking at nature, that is genuine, honest, and joyous. I am looking forward to the release of the next episode of “The Riot and the Dance,” which will feature aquatic creatures!', 'Creation: An Organic Unit. The original creation testifies in its beauty, complexity and biodiversity of the supreme intelligence and creativity of God. On the one hand, nature was created as a self-sufficient entity able to exist substantially well without humans. On the other, human individuals are entirely dependent on nature for their own survival. This order presupposes that human beings are not the only ones who possess inherent value on earth. Humans are part of a very complex ecosystem in which every part contributes to the equilibrium of the whole. The entire system is envisaged to favor the full realization of life. Every kind of plant or animal, every cell, every atom, is a phenomenon of creativity, wisdom and genius (Psalm 104: 18-24) displayed by God, the Divine Engineer and supreme Artist of this cosmos. Thus, nature is not only our environment but also our partner. The beings that co-exist with humanity are not simple resources. As living creatures made by God, they are worth to be preserved and loved for what they are and for the sake of higher good (Psalm 104:18-24). The Ministry of Stewardship Entrusted to Humanity. The text of Genesis does not give free hand to humanity for the management of nature; instead, it orders the conservation of its resources (Genesis 2:15). Human beings received the responsibility, since the beginning, to keep the equilibrium of nature and to cultivate the delicate relation of solidarity between God’s created beings and their environment. The fact that the care of the earth was promptly entrusted to the first human couple (Genesis 1:28, 2:25) suggests that the environment must never be entirely left to itself, but that human beings have a responsibility in the management of nature. The Earth Belongs to God. Although nature was designed to sustain life, and therefore intended for the benefit of human beings as well, the environment does not belong to humans. The Bible affirms that God has ownership over the earth. Consequently, human beings have the moral duty of living responsible lifestyles that do not degrade the environment and promote the perpetuation of life (Genesis 1: 29-30). This entails respect for any kind of life, vegetal or animal (Hosea 2:18, Proverbs 12:10) and responsible management of natural resources (Deuteronomy 20: 11), with the permanent duty of protecting the environment (Revelation 11:18, 7:3). Biblical Laws on Environment. The Pentateuch establishes a whole series of laws of environmental value with the intention of helping to honor and preserve the received inheritance. To avoid the exhaustion of cultivated lands, the Mosaic law prescribes one year of rest every seven working years, and tells that the earth deprived of its rest of fallow, “takes revenge” (Leviticus 26.14-35). Numerous laws are apparently orientated to the maintenance of public hygiene and intended to prevent the most immediate forms of contamination, such as the health norms of “recycling” excrements and garbage, that is to say of “waste at risk” (Deuteronomy 23:13-15). Among the precepts on the conservation of life we are surprised by the one which concerns the protection of fauna, notably the preservation of adult birds to ensure the perpetuation of their species (Deuteronomy 22:6-7). Other laws favoring the respect for environment include dispositions restraining the cutting down of trees even in times of war (Deuteronomy 20:19-20). We could also mention the prescriptions against sexual unions between different species, laws against hybridization (Deuteronomy 22:9; Leviticus 19:19), and also laws promoting precaution in lighting fires (Exodus 22.6). Sabbath: Memorial of Creation. Among all biblical prescriptions with an environmental impact, the most interesting is probably the one that concerns the Sabbath rest. The original concept of “work” (melakhah), used in the fourth commandment, refers principally to the relationship between humans and the earth. Therefore, the biblical request of suspension of labor during the Sabbath encompasses the systematic re-establishment of harmony between humans and the earth. This command, without counting its spiritual beneficial effects, has the important secondary effect of leaving nature at rest every seven days by reducing the consumption of energy and its related pollution. The Sabbath day message affirms not only that human beings need a weekly day of rest, but that the earth also needs a respite and an opportunity to recover from the strain imposed by human labor. The Hope in the Promise of the New Earth and Heavens. When the prophets announce the final restoration of humankind and its environment (Isaiah 40:4; 42:16, 41:18-19; 43:19; 48:21; 49:10; 54:13-17; 55:13), salvation is extended to all categories of living beings in the renewed world (Isaiah 11:6-11). This salvation, at the moment, is only a hope. The earth suffers and is waiting eagerly for its adoption and redemption (Romans 8:18-23). However, if God’s plan is to bring a new creation to fruition and make everything new (Revelation 21:1 – 22:5) why should humans care to act responsibly in managing the present world? On this issue, the Bible is clear: to have access to the new promised world, it is necessary to respect here and now the present creation and its Creator (Revelation 14:6-7). In the last book of the Bible, one of the most serious condemnation is pronounced against “those who destroy the earth” (Revelation 11:18). If the best manner of honoring an artist is to safeguard its work, the best manner of honoring the Creator is to protect His creatures and creation. The respect for the Creator includes respect towards His work. It is a logical conclusion to think that God reserves life to those who love life. Jesus and His Teachings on Nature. In the gospels, Jesus often leads his interlocutors to observe nature as a sign of his message of life: the fig which burgeons (Mark 13:28); the growing seed (Mark 4:3-9; 26-29; Matthew 13:24-30); the sparrows which are sold in the market (Matthew 10:29); the flash of lightning which shines in the night (Matthew 24:27); the splendor of dusk (Luke 12:55). The very fact that Jesus uses nature to bring insights for our everyday life affirms that God’s creation is a witness of God’s will. In this environment, human beings can find divinely intended messages and applications. Therefore, to destroy God’s creation means not to be able to listen to His teachings, and therefore be cut off from an important source of communication. In conclusion, the teachings from Scripture inspire me to adopt an ethical behavior towards creation. The care for the environment in which I live is not just a duty I should fulfill; it becomes the expression of my personal faith towards my Creator.', 'One person’s cultural background can bias their view about people from other cultures…even before they have ever met. Could people also have a bias about how they think about other creatures? It may even be possible that scientific culture could prejudice the way researchers see creature-environmental relations with the potential to bias whole research programs. Last November, Great Britain’s prestigious Royal Society held a conference to deliberate if evolutionary theory needed an “extension” to accommodate fresh ideas from new discoveries. Nature had also opened the question for debate (Fig. 1). Supporters of status quo evolutionary theory held that new findings could readily be explained within the current structure. While an advocate of the new “Extended Evolutionary Synthesis,” Gerd Muller of the University of Vienna had previously stated that one value of the extension would overcome the “restrictions” of “externalism.”[1] Externalism is principally a way to think about how organisms formed, yet it may bias how we think and write about a creature’s behavior. What is externalism supposed to explain for evolutionary theory and what elements of it does Muller hope to escape? As it turns out, disputes over whether the source of an organism’s form derives from external or internal causes have been longstanding. Stephen Jay Gould frames this historical discussion: “The designation of one principle or the other [internalism/structuralism or externalism/functionalism] as the causal foundation of biology virtually defines the position of any scientist towards the organic world and its causes of order. Shall we regard the plan of high-level taxonomic form as primary, with local adaptations viewed as a set of minor wrinkles (often confusing) upon an abstract majesty? Or do local adaptations build the entire system from the bottom up?...This dichotomy continues to define a major issue in modern evolutionary debates: does functional adaptation or structural constraint maintain priority in setting evolutionary pathways and directions?”[2] In this case, the phenomenon most in need of explanation is: why do organisms appear to fit their environments so well? They have traits that seem to precisely relate to, and even exploit properties of nature (e.g., inertia and gravity) and other external conditions. Externalists, see these traits as imposed on organisms from the outside. This generally happens by the very external conditions, designated as “selective pressures,” which match so well to the trait. Michael Denton explains that according to the paradigm “often referred to as functionalism, the main designs of life (pentadactyl limb, body plans, etc.) are not the result of physical law, that is, not immanent in nature or arising from intrinsic physical constraints inherent in biological matter, but rather the result of specific adaptations built additively by selection during the course of evolution, to serve particular functional ends, ends that are imposed by the environment and that are external to the organism itself.”[3] Few people recognize that in the externalist approach organisms are viewed essentially as passive lumps of clay being molded by their environment. In fact, two researchers stated that is exactly how Charles Darwin’s theory encapsulates the organism-environment relationship, “He [Darwin] accepted the view that the environment directly instructs the organism how to vary, and he proposed a mechanism for inheriting those changes…The organism was like modeling clay, and remolding of the clay meant that each of the billions of little grains was free to move a little bit in any direction to generate new form…If an organism needed a wing, an opposable thumb, longer legs, webbed feet, or placental development, any of these would emerge under the proper selective conditions with time.”[4] Which Marta Linde Medina, another leading theoretician in this field, sums up, “as a result, organisms are as passive as the matter that forms them.”[5] Externalism has a strong philosophical appeal to those who advocate for explanations of biological phenomena that are fully naturalistic. It is certainly not teleological. Externalism also can feed into the view that if God didn’t create nature, nature can somehow create itself—including crafting living things. Interestingly, externalism is analogously central to both Darwin’s theory of evolution and influential psychologist B.F. Skinner’s theory of human behavior. “First, both theories draw on an externalist or ‘outside-in’ pattern of explanation, in which the structure or behaviour of living things is seen as a consequence of their environments. Second, both rely on a process that can be described loosely as ‘trial and error.’”[6] Externalism is currently the dominant view in biology. Denton elaborates on the probability that any view other than externalism would be “very alien” and essentially “inconceivable to most English-speaking biologists.”[7] But what if it is wrong in the sense that it has identified causality backwards? This updated insight may be indicated by waves of discoveries documented by Gerd Muller and others. They’ve found a principal role for internal factors. What if populations of organisms could be seen from a design-based perspective as traveling through diverse environments just as human-designed vehicles do? Designed capacity of an entity is always an internal feature as designers build into their craft the ability to successfully engage all anticipated external conditions. Similarly, innate self-adjusting capacity should be true for organisms. Thus, intrinsic design could control both its basic body plan and 100% of its ability to adapt itself to external conditions. Internal programming also specifies certain external conditions to be a stimulus or a cue for both man-made things and organisms. Inherently designed systems control detection of challenging exposures and would specify internally driven self-adjustments primarily as targeted solutions to environmental challenges and rarely, if ever, by “trial-and-error.” Individuals (or populations over multiple generations) could actively detect environmental conditions and could express a spectrum of phenotypes from a relatively stable genotype controlled by innate systems. Enriching the phenotypic panoply is the capacity of several biological systems to “learn” from environmental interactions by processes similar to IBM’s “Watson” computing system; meaning, organisms are designed with a nature already devised to be nurtured. It may be demonstrated that organisms are causal for the successful fit of their traits-to-exposures, rather than externalism’s notion of personified environments seeing, selecting, and saving traits to build organisms. Perhaps, the tight organism-environment relationship may be explained by populations of active, problem-solving organisms continuously tracking environmental changes via innate mechanisms to express heritable phenotypes bearing problem solving potential—which already precede environmental challenges. This is worth thinking about as an internalist approach may well be confirmed by continuing research.', 'A very common reaction to the thought of “microbes” is a compelling desire to slather up in hand sanitizer! However, it is seldom realized that the greatest majority of microorganisms are at the very least not harmful, and at the most necessary for human life! Many aspects of microbial interaction with our environment allow it to be so perfect for humans. Some of these aspects include oxygen generation, nitrogen fixation, decomposition, food-chain contributions, food production, and antibiotic production. However, in this blog I want to highlight one specific aspect of the contribution that microbes make to our lives and our environment by focusing on symbiotic relationships. A symbiotic relationship is one in which at least one partner must be in the relationship in order to survive. We know now that symbiotic relationships between microbes and other organisms are common, and are proving to be more of the rule of life than the exception. A popular example of symbiosis is the relationship that corals have with algal cells living within them (Fig. 1).The algal cell within the coral photosynthesizes providing metabolic products for the coral to consume, and the coral offers a safe living environment for the alga. When corals become stressed, they often expel the algal cells, causing “bleaching,” and usually soon after die. Corals are the builders of the oceans; constructing reefs that provide safety and an environment for thousands of other organisms to live and thrive. Lichens are another example of symbiosis involving microorganisms. Lichens typically grow on rocks or the bark of trees and are a symbiosis of algal or cyanobacterial cells living within a fungal matrix of hyphae (long, hair-like fungal cells). Together these organisms form what we know as lichens that are not only beautiful, but form an important part of the food chain for other organisms. Even more widespread and important, is the symbiosis of bacteria in the guts of all plant-consuming animals. Animals and humans lack the ability to metabolize plants because they can’t digest cellulose, a polymer of glucose that makes up the woody (fibrous) parts of all plants. This glucose is linked together in a fashion that prevents our enzymes from breaking it apart. Nevertheless, cellulose is the main source of carbon and energy for many animals that live on grass, straw, and, in the winters, eat bark right off the trunks of trees. These animals are able to survive on cellulose because they have bacterial symbionts in their guts that convert it into various fats, which can then be digested and consumed for nutrition. I imagine when God spoke the plants and animals into existence and gave them the “herbs of the field to eat,”(Gen 1:30) that He also, in the same breath, created a system of symbiosis where every animal was constantly dependent on something unseen to provide nutrients – an important spiritual lesson of our dependence on God for our daily bread, not only to nourish our physical bodies, but to sustain our spiritual being. New studies of symbiosis in humans reveal that the bacteria in our guts profoundly impact our health: our microbiome affects obesity, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, and mental disorders. Scientists are discovering that the foods we eat not only affect our own health, but the health and variety of our microbiome, which then, in turn, affects our health. Some microbes in our intestines produce vitamin K, a vital nutrient. Researchers now know that human exposure to microbes causes an improvement of their immunity and decreases allergies like hay-fever. Symptoms of some deadly allergies like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis can even be reduced by introduction of microbe infections such as worms. The number of microorganisms in our body is equal to the number of our own cells, however due to their microscopic size we outweigh them! I believe that when God formed humans he built into us a symbiotic relationship with microorganisms that is part of who we are and aids in the functioning of our bodies. Once again, a spiritual lesson for God’s quiet, but constant help as we make our way through this world. A final example of a symbiotic relationship is that between soil microbes and plants. Of the vascular plants researched, 95% were found to be associated with mycorrhizae, which are fungi that associate with roots of plants. Additionally, some types of bacteria, referred to as rhizobia, live within the roots of legume plants (such as soybeans, alfalfa, and peanuts) in specialized structures called root nodules where the bacteria provide nitrogen to the plant, and the plant supplies the bacteria with simple sugars (Fig. 2). Our world is interdependent. God created us to be in association with each other. This is not only seen among humans, but in other created organisms as well. We admit that sin has had an effect on all of creation, and the Darwinian competition and struggle for survival might be an expression of this. However, cooperation and positive interaction between organisms, even of different species, is also an important narrative in biology. One lesson we can glean from this look into the natural world of microorganisms and symbiosis is that we are happiest and healthiest when we are living our lives in service to one another.', 'The world must have seemed like a big place to Helga Estby, a Norwegian woman who walked across America in the year 1896. Helga immigrated to the United States with her parents in 1871 at the age of 11. On May 5, 1896, at the age of nearly 36, Helga and her 18 year old daughter Clara set out to walk across the United States. They started from Mica Creek, in far eastern Washington state, and walked an estimated 3500 miles to New York City, where they arrived on December 24. The mother and daughter may have been the first to walk intentionally across the United States on foot. Since then, numerous people have repeated the feat, usually requiring from five to seven months. From the point of view of a person living in 1896, the world would seem big and its resources virtually unlimited. But this view has changed. We now recognize the world is not so big, and its resources very definitely are limited. Part of the credit for this comes from a photo known as “The Blue Marble.” On December 7, 1972, the Apollo 17 crew took a photograph of our planet, showing it to be a blue island in space. That photo has become known as “The Blue Marble.” Although it was not the first photo of the earth from space, it captured the attention of the American public in an unprecedented way. The photograph coincided with a surge in interest in environmental protection, and quickly became an icon of the environmental movement. Our view of the earth had shifted from one of unlimited potential to one of a fragile blue island in space. Concern for the environment continues to occupy a place in current culture. We hear frequent warnings of global warming and its possible relationship to human use of fossil fuels, sunspot activity or variations in earth’s orbit. As the human population increases, other species are crowded out and lost to extinction. Fears of an ongoing “mass extinction” are often expressed, with varied estimates of how many species are threatened with extinction before we even discover their existence. Many voices oppose the expansion of human population at the expense of other species, sometimes resorting to reducing humans to the level of other species. At its extreme, some have even promoted the idea that animals such as chimpanzees should be regarded as “persons” in the same sense as humans. Fortunately, the courts have not agreed, perhaps aware that such a precedent could easily be applied to gorillas, then monkeys, dogs, horses, pigs, etc., with no obvious criteria to distinguish those with legal accountability for their actions from those without it. Meanwhile, poverty and pollution, both related to environmental degradation, reduce the quality of life for increasing numbers of humans, increasing human misery and threatening to destabilize society. Amidst the turmoil and challenges of caring for our world, what is an appropriate Christian response? Fortunately, the biblical story of creation provides some important principles for responsible care of “Island Earth.” For example, Genesis indicates that God regards the animals with favor. After creating the animals and before humans were created, God considered the world to be “good. This shows that the creatures with which we share this world, along with their habitats, have value in themselves. Another point from the creation story is that humans were put in charge of the world. God gave us “dominion” over the other creatures. The word “dominion” implies a kind of kingship, which means we are to function as kings on behalf of the other animals. Kings properly use their authority to manage their subjects for the common good. Our mandate from creation is to use our power to enhance the quality of life, not only for ourselves, but also for the other species that share the planet with us. It is true that we sometimes have to restrain or even kill other animals, but we do so with a sense of regret, looking forward to the promised new creation when such things will no longer be necessary. We should never cause unnecessary suffering, even to rats and other nuisance animals, because we serve and represent a Creator who values all creatures and intended them to live in harmony with one another. Recognition of humans as created in the image of God is a third point that guides our care for the environment. Every human should be treated with respect and dignity out of respect to the One whose image they carry. Poverty, violence and suffering had no place in the “very good” earth originally created. These atrocities are the result of human choices, and all who recognize their calling as stewards of creation will work to oppose them. From these biblical principles we can derive guidelines for managing our world and its resources. This includes our treatment of the physical environment, the diverse biota with which we coexist, and our fellow humans. We may not be able to control some aspects of the physical environment such as sunlight and earth’s orbit, but we do have powerful effects on the quality of the water, soil and atmosphere. Waste management is a problem we have still not solved, as seen in the “garbage patches” of our oceans, the smog in the air of our cities, the industrial pollution in our soil and groundwater, and the problem of safely storing radioactive waste products. We can all see evidence of changes in the climate. Whether these are due to human activities, to natural cycles or both, we can carefully evaluate our use of resources and plan how to change our habits to respond to changes in climate. As individuals, we can reduce consumption, recycle materials, and properly dispose of household wastes. As citizens and tax payers we can support responsible efforts to manage waste disposal, maintain supplies of clean water, and work to eliminate pollution from industries and automobiles. Each of these methods is consistent with the biblical principle that we are given the task of being stewards of God’s creation. There are many ways we can care for the other living organisms. Setting aside land in wilderness areas helps preserve diverse habitats, and also provides us with opportunities for healthful outdoor activities. Wildlife refuges provide safe resting places for birds in migration and habitats for the plants and animals of the region. Habitat corridors linking wildlife preserves improve the survival chances of threatened species. Animals used in research should be treated well, and not left to suffer. Domesticated animals should be treated with care, even when raised for food purposes. Pet predators can be spayed or neutered to prevent destruction of smaller creatures, such as by feral cats. Each of these activities, along with many others, is evidence that we take seriously our responsibility as stewards of “Island Earth. Care for other humans should be a high priority for we who have been charged to exercise dominion in our world. This includes respecting the rights of others to the basic freedoms: freedom of speech; freedom of religion; freedom of the press; freedom of assembly; and freedom to participate in the political process. We should endeavor to provide opportunity to each person to work to support themselves and their families. We should provide means to reduce suffering from disease, poverty and environmental degradation. All humans are part of one family, and family members take care of one another. Caring for the environment is a natural concern for those who accept the biblical teaching of a six-day creation, in which God created a good physical environment, filled the world with diverse kinds of plants and animals, created humans in His own image and gave them responsibility to act as stewards on His behalf. Our understanding of this responsibility has increased over the years as we have come to realize that our world and its resources are finite, and that we truly live on an island called Earth.', 'The number of different kinds of living organisms is one measure of biological diversity, or what has become known as “biodiversity.” Our world’s oceans have the highest known biodiversity, second only to the number of species found in the tropical rainforest. However, if we consider the potential number of undiscovered species in marine systems, it’s likely that our oceans would come out on top as the environment with the greatest number of species on the planet. While more than 70% of Earth is covered with water, much of the vast expanses of ocean have relatively few species. Instead, much of the known biodiversity in our oceans is found in special areas that cover less than one percent of the ocean’s floor – coral reefs[i]. This is because although the vast areas of the ocean have plenty of space, they’re a little like deserts when it comes to the nutrients animals at the lowest level of the food chain need to survive and grow. In contrast, coral reefs are like oases, where nutrients are plentiful, but space is hard to come by. With so many organisms, from microscopic bacteria and algae to sea turtles and hammerhead sharks, reliant on these important nutrients, there’s always lots of competition for places to live in coral reefs. But, there’s cooperation, too! Among other things, both competition and cooperation provide us with spectacular views of so many species of organisms (that high biodiversity) in these coral reef oases. Still, we know relatively little about the number of species in coral reefs, and only very recently about the biodiversity of the deep ocean floor. For instance, we know of about 7,200 species[ii] of single-cell marine algae (known as phytoplankton), many of which are caught and eaten by microscopic predators (known as zooplankton, some of which are the larval, or baby, stages of larger animals), of which there are an estimated 50,000 species![iii] We know something about a great number of the groups of animals that live in and around coral reefs, as well. For example, there are about 11,000 known species of corals (which are animals, not plants) and their relatives (the jellyfishes and anemones) in existence today[iv]. One of the largest known groups of ocean organisms is the Molluscs (the snails, sea slugs, chitons, and octopuses) of which there are some 100,000 described species (although not all of these live in the ocean), along with another 70,000 that are now only known from the fossil record[v]. There are several groups of marine animals that are made up of large numbers of species. One of these is the Superclass Crustacea, with a whopping 42,000 living species[vi], including the crabs, lobsters, shrimp, and the barnacles[vii]. With so many species living in our oceans (and many more which have yet to be discovered)[viii], we can see that our oceans are places of amazing diversity, beauty, and discovery. However, humans are taking a toll on these ocean systems with our input of chemical and plastic pollution. There are some places in our oceans where plastic fragments now make up a large amount of materials zooplankton and small fish are eating every day[ix]. Plastic pollution in our oceans and washing up on our beaches has become so wide-spread, it now accounts for the death of many marine animals and oceanic birds, even in places where no humans live[x]. It’s time for each one of us to stand up for our fellow creatures that live in the oceans. As stewards of the creation, let’s not simply talk about believing in creation, but work together to care for creation in ways we’ve been entrusted to do so from the beginning[xi]']\n",

      "['\\nJune 8, 2012\\nBeauty is a quality of existence that has engaged philosophers since Plato. It is an ancient ideal we should pursue, along with goodness and truth. From classical times its hallmarks were harmony, proportion and coherence, or unity. There is also beauty of sound, as in good music, and delicacies of touch, taste and smell. There is beauty of thought and imagination derived from the creative minds of men and women. Poetry, rhetoric, logic, dance, an elegant mathematical equation…all can inspire a response of delight. Yet beauty is not purely a response, perceived merely in the eye of the beholder; it resides in the object itself, and that has to be the result of deliberate design.\\nWhen Phillip Johnson spearheaded the intelligent design movement in the early nineties, he set in motion a huge debate about the origin of life. The focus then was on complexity, with little attention to aesthetics. Living things are intricate and highly ordered, and that order doesn’t just appear by chance out of nowhere. It has to be designed, and design implies intelligence and purpose. Yet in explaining life, many leaders in the sciences have resisted the idea of design; they rely on natural law and chance. They exclude a purposeful intelligence or a designer-God.\\nToday, after twenty years, the advocates of intelligent design have won many victories, arguing from science. If you read Dembski, or Nelson, or Behe, or Wells, or any number of others, you will see that mechanistic naturalism is under serious scholarly challenge. God does get a hearing. Yet in academia scientism still rules, and the debate seems to have reached a stalemate. That’s why, I think, we should strengthen the design argument by an emphasis on the aesthetic side of nature, on beauty.\\nBeauty is a special kind of order, different from complexity, and producing it requires a deliberate purpose. It points to a source that goes beyond mere intelligence. The paintings of Van Gogh tell us the artist exists, but they also tell us something about his persona, what kind of man he was. So likewise the beauties we see in nature, and in humankind, tell us that God exists and also reveals some of God’s personal qualities. Complexity may point to a clever engineer-Creator, but beauty, with all its rich diversity, points to an artist-Creator, and an artist by nature has a different, emotional, celebratory view of reality. That’s the kind of Creator we deal with. From his art we can judge his tastes and his purposes, his thoughts and his feelings. And he becomes more like us, with emotions and preferences, closer to us and more approachable.\\nHow did objective beauty arise? What First Cause, other than a purposeful mind, could cause beautiful patterns to appear? How can evolutionary theory, which excludes God and intelligence agency, account for them? And further, how does evolution, which relies only on chance mechanisms, explain how humans possess an ability to perceive and enjoy beauty? Here are two separate entities with no physical connection: the beautiful objects or ideas, and our conscious capacity to appreciate them. Chance cannot explain the parallel but separate development, over eons of time, of two distinct parts of a system, when each part is meaningless without the other. Such a system had to be designed, and with a majestic purpose for our benefit. It’s powerful evidence for Creation.\\nBeauty raises another question: Why does it survive? In Darwin’s world survival depends on toughness, on competitiveness, not on loveliness or any perception of aesthetics. Darwin would surround us with life that is rugged, strong, functionally efficient but brutal and savage: not a pleasant place for living. Naturalists recognize this problem. Steven Pinker, psychology professor and atheist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referred to beautiful music as a puzzling gift, and he called it “auditory cheesecake”. It enriches our lives, he said in Nature (March, 2002), but it makes no contribution to survival.\\nBeyond giving us compelling evidence of divine causation, beauty in the natural world tells us some remarkable truths about God’s artistic taste. He is extravagant with his gifts. He gives us delicately tasting fruits, just for our pleasure, and he made silver-toned songbirds and magnificent plumage, far beyond any requirement of mate attraction. He was not content with efficient function only. He went further and gave us aesthetic pleasure. And it is not presumptuous to marvel that the things we enjoy, God also enjoys. Far above us, God’s thoughts are not our thoughts. Yet we are told we are made “…partakers of the divine nature…” We truly do bear in our persons the imago dei.  The likeness surely is not only physical, but in the mind, and partly it is in our capacity for aesthetic pleasure. He likes what we like. That’s why Adam and Eve could walk with God in the Garden, enjoying together the beauty around them.\\nEven today, our tastes in visual patterns, in music, and in speech should be cultivated to approach the lofty tastes of the author of beauty. The full range of aesthetic pleasure has been opened to us, both God-made and man-made. It includes the splendors of the cosmos, all observable nature, and also our man-made music, our art, and our dance. King David loved exuberant dance, and surely so does God. He enjoys what we create: our sculpture, our poetry and our rhetoric, our software algorithms, even our superb gadgetry: all our exalted flights of inventive fancy. He knows what’s in The Getty and in the Guggenheim, and he knows the qualities of the music with which we choose to worship him. He understands the good and the not good. So we too can discriminate, and we can choose and enjoy.\\nWe are warned in Romans 1:20 that those who observe God’s handiwork yet do not believe “are without excuse.” Before the artist-Creator we must stand in awe. We can lift our wonderment above the mechanics of Creation, the hard intricacies of particle physics, of quantum gravity, of string theory and the mysteries of time. Certainly we can wrestle with these entities and seek understanding. But always let us also revel in the wonder, in the beauty of it all. That is the divine quality that brings us face to face with our artist-Creator. And we, too, may walk with him in the Garden. ******************************\\nBernard Brandstater\\nLoma Linda University\\n8 June 2012\\nbbrandstater@gmail.com\\n\\n', '\\nJune 18, 2013\\nThe following blog is a chapter taken from the book: Entrusted - Christians and Environmental Care by S. Dunbar, L. J. Gibson, and H. M. Rasi. If you are interested in reading more you can find the book at: http://adventus21.com/Producto.aspx?idProducto=457\\nWhat can we do at home to care for the environment? –by Carrie A. C. Wolfe\\nAs Christians, we believe that God created the Earth and us, and has entrusted us to care for the planet and each other. What are some practical things that we can do at home to care for the Earth’s environment? Before you step out in action, pray individually and with your family about what God desires your family to do in caring for His creation. Prayerfully consider the path He impresses on you. Perhaps He will lead you to start with simple steps. But first, as a family, learn to love God’s great outdoors.\\nBe Involved With Nature\\nThe more time we spend out in God’s creation, the more likely we are to treasure and value it1 and feel compelled to care for nature. Teach children to love what God has created and care for the environment. One simple way is to take children on nature hikes. You can teach them to observe animals and plants and to use books to identify birds, plants, trees, and animals and their tracks. A fun activity for the family while on a hike is to make plaster casts of animal prints you find.2\\nAnother fun family activity is to raise a caterpillar to a butterfly or moth. Monarch butterflies are common in parts of North and South America. You can find the caterpillars on milkweed plants; search under the leaves for a green caterpillar with black and white stripes. They eat milkweed leaves so you will need new fresh leaves as the caterpillar eats them. Watching the caterpillar grow, the chrysalis form, and the butterfly emerge is awe-inspiring and can bind our hearts to the Creator and His work. If you don’t live where monarchs are present, you can bring other caterpillars into your home to watch and see what happens. Another enjoyable learning activity is to catch a tadpole or polliwog from the edge of a pond. Take a little net and jar with a lid on your walk to the pond. Bring home a few tadpoles. They need clean de-chlorinated water and food (frozen lettuce or spinach works well) and may take many weeks before they transform (metamorphose) into a frog. If it is a native species, you can release the frog back into the same pond; otherwise you need to care for your new pets in your home.3\\nYou can also lead children to learn more about creation by providing them books or magazines on nature topics. Every family should consider subscribing to a magazine that has well-written articles on environmental issues. Increased knowledge and awareness can lead to a greater desire to act and care for the environment.\\nVisit state or provincial parks, pay the entry fee and write your name in the log of visitors. If you use a nature trail that has a registry, be sure to record your hike. The more these parks and trails are used the more likely they will continue receiving funding. Your family could plan to stay overnight in the park campground. The visitor or interpretive center may have much information, including special programs and hikes, where you can learn more about natural things, including the sky at night, animals in ponds or streams, the types of plants and birds nearby, and what you can do to help these plants and animals continue to thrive. While at the park you might also learn how you and your family might volunteer for organized data collection efforts, such as to count birds or plants for scientific surveys.\\nRecycle, Reuse and Reduce\\nOur environment is God’s gift to us. We live in it, we use it, and we enjoy it. It is also our responsibility to care for it. What are some practical things we can do to achieve this laudable objective? An easy way to start is by thinking recycle, reuse and reduce.\\nIs there a recycling program in your neighborhood or city? Some household items that are commonly recycled are glass, paper, cardboard, metal cans, and plastics. Some places offer money for your old aluminum. It is easier and less expensive to recycle used aluminum than it is to mine and process it.\\nMany cities have a public recycling center where you can deposit your recyclable items for free. Talk with family members about where in your home you will temporarily collect your items for recycling, and start a biweekly habit of making the trip to drop off your recyclables.\\nSome cities also have curbside pickup of certain recyclables. Look in your phonebook yellow pages for recycling companies. They are becoming more common and many don’t require you to sort your recycling items; you may simply mix glass, paper, cardboard and metal cans together. Recycling companies have equipment that can separate these items.\\nConsider reusing items and reducing your household waste. One easy item to reuse or reduce is your grocery bags. Use reusable cloth bags for your shopping, and avoid plastic bags.\\nIf you do get new grocery bags each time you shop, reuse them at home; instead of buying small garbage bags for your wastepaper baskets, reuse grocery bags. Other ways to reuse and reduce the amount of garbage you produce is to cut old clothes into rags for household cleaning; or donate used clothing and household items to a thrift shop so someone else can reuse them.\\nTwo examples of websites to assist communities to reduce the amount of waste going to landfills and to reuse items are the Freecycle Network and “Craigslist.” The Freecycle Network4 is active in over 85 countries; it is an e-mail list where you can list household items that you want to give away for free. Craigslist5 is also active internationally and has a free section to advertise your used items. Many things that your family doesn’t need anymore may be just right for someone else.\\nSupport Financially\\nDonate your time or money to an environment-friendly organization to help advance their work. There are international and local organizations that your family may wish to support.\\nTry Composting\\nComposting is more than recycling or reducing the amount of waste going into landfill. Composting is a system of complete and natural reprocessing. Many of us throw away many compostable materials in the kitchen garbage, not realizing that this garbage could be turned into composted humus, a soil conditioner and fertilizer to be used in the garden, yard, or potted houseplants. Your family can purchase a composting container, or make a homemade composting bin from chicken wire formed into a cylinder. Press the open bottom into the earth in your yard. Put a few sticks on the bottom to help your compost get enough air. Add short layers of “green” items, like cut grass, or your kitchen waste (e.g., vegetable scraps from preparing food, peels, leftover food but not meat), alternating with thin layers of “brown” things, such as dead leaves, crumpled or shredded paper, or waste litter from vegetarian pets, like gerbils or guinea pigs. Add a little water to your compost heap, but don’t let it get too wet. Keep a cover over your compost bin so it won’t get soaked with rain. Soon the mixture will decay; you can’t make a mistake composting because it will happen no matter what you do, whether it is hot or cold, or you add an uneven mixture of “green” and “brown” materials. Depending on the outdoor temperature, it might take months or a year and is great for plants to grow in. The process is faster in hot climates and could take more than a year where it is very cold. Foul odors may occur if the compost doesn’t have enough oxygen or if there is too much “green” and too little “brown” material. If it starts to smell, mix it to give it more air and add more “brown” material.6\\nIf you don’t have a backyard, an alternative to a compost bin is using worms to compost your food scraps.7 Brandling worms (the type used for fishing) will live in a plastic bucket, or vermicompost bin, and eat their weight in excess food every day or so. They eat and breakdown the food, recycling it into rich compost that can be used for organic gardening or fertilizer for indoor plants.8\\nBuy Local\\nBy making the choice to buy food locally grown, you are supporting your local economy and lowering the amount of gasoline or diesel used in food transportation from a distance away. The price may reflect lower transportation costs. Also, buying fresh produce means it might taste better, since it was more likely to have been picked when it was ripe. Your local market may indicate which produce was grown locally. You may have a local “farmers’ market” or food co-op near your home that you can patronize.\\nBe a Vegetarian\\nChoosing to eat a diet that includes less or no meat and more plant-based foods will mean less pollution from animal feed lots (urine, antibiotics, and other waste materials from factory farms can seep into rivers and ground water).9 In addition, if fewer animals are raised for slaughter, the amount of grains that go into animal feed can be reduced and used for people instead. The amount of food the animals eat is huge compared with the amount of meat obtained from their slaughter. It is much more economical for people to eat grain and plantbased foods than to eat meat.10 Adequate protein is easy to obtain from a plantbased diet. For example, all essential amino acids are available in sufficient amount when a person eats a mixture of rice and beans, or corn and beans. Also, choosing to eat a plant-based diet reduces the demand for meat, and hence less slaughter of animals.\\nHarvest Rainwater\\nIf you live in a place where clean water is not readily available, consider capturing rainwater in a barrel or cistern for use later when water is scarce.11 You may use it to water your vegetable garden or other plants, or even to bathe. If captured water is used for drinking, the water should be properly filtered, boiled or treated. Even where drinking water is clean and readily available, it makes environmental sense to capture rainwater and use it for lawns and gardens, instead of using processed drinking water.12\\nUnless you live where it rains often, and the earth around you is saturated with water, you might want to catch some of the rain that falls and keep it on your land or in your own yard, not letting it run off down the street carrying the soil with it. Such water can be used to make rain gardens.13 The rain garden will allow water to soak into your lawn or yard, and you can fill the area with “perennial flowers and native vegetation.”14\\nUse Wind and Solar Power\\nEnergy from both the wind and the sun can be harnessed to produce electricity. Burning less coal for household electricity consumption is better for the environment. If you live in a location where ordinances don’t prohibit wind turbines, consider buying and installing a roof- or tower-mountable vertical axis wind turbine.15 If your home doesn’t use all the energy produced by your wind turbine, the generator can be tied into the electrical grid, or you may store the energy in a battery. Some countries give tax credit for installing wind turbines.\\nSolar panels are becoming more efficient and available for homes. European countries, such as Spain and Germany, are far ahead in solar power utilization.16 You can purchase solar panels for your home and/or use solar power to make hot water and for heating the home. Technology to make flexible solar cells is now also available for personal use to charge portable electronic devices, such as cellular phones and small computers.\\nInvolve Your Church in Conservation\\nWhile your home and family can do much to care for the environment, as a Christian you have an opportunity and an obligation to make your church sensitive to environmental concerns. Share with your church the biblical reasons for taking care of God’s creation. Challenge your church as opportunity arises to be good stewards of Creation.17 Educate and work with your church friends, church elders, and your pastor to do simple things to care for the environment together: creating among church members an appreciation for nature by organizing walks and camps; printing church bulletins on post-consumer, recycled paper; placing and using recycle containers in the church building; and arranging seminars on some of the environmental concerns mentioned in this chapter, such as recycling, composting, catching rainwater, and being responsible stewards of God’s creation.\\nSummary\\nPrayerfully consider the path God wishes for you and your family in caring for His creation. Let Him impress on you the first way for you to begin your practical care of the environment. Perhaps you will start a recycling system in your home. Or you might spend some time learning how to reuse more items instead of throwing them in the trash. Donate your time or money to an environment-friendly organization to help advance their work. Consider the possible use of wind or solar power for energy in your home. Whatever you choose to do, remember your first duty is to be a good steward of God’s creation.\\nCarrie A. C.

Dunbar, L. J. Gibson, and H. M. Rasi. \\nI love to backpack and climb mountains, mainly because I crave the solitude and richer glimpses of God that I find when the only sounds are gurgling streams and the trills of birdcalls, and the only sights are lofty peaks and dense forests. When I reach the mountain’s summit, life is suddenly put in its proper perspective, as God reminds me of how small I am, and yet how much He cares for me. However, I am increasingly fearful that human consumerism and abuse of earth’s resources will soon wipe out many of the remaining tracts of wilderness.\\nConservation is critical in order to ensure such deep experiences with God are possible for coming generations. From its beginnings, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has cared about the proper use of all the resources God has entrusted to humanity.[1] Believing that biblical theology must inform environmental care, Adventists hold that the biblical picture of stewardship encompasses environmental resources, as well as money, possessions, time, health, and opportunities. The faith-pillars of Adventism include reverence for the seventh-day Sabbath, belief in a literal creation week, and humanity’s role as caretaker over the earth and animals.\\nAlthough the biblical mandate for environmental and animal care can be explored from different angles and can include a survey of many biblical passages, true theology arises from solid exegesis. Hence I wish to provide an example of the richness of environmental and animal care found in one representative passage, uncovering various principles of such care, which can be related to other passages as well.\\nLeviticus 25 is one of the key passages concerned with rest for the land and God’s plan for the conservation of all creation, containing real-world, modern day applications for all Christians. Although certain aspects of the text apply only to ancient Israel, the foundational principles of conservation are based on Genesis 1-3, and applicable to all those concerned with the environment. In addition, the passage gives special reasons for earth care and conservation that other Christians may find harder to substantiate when the reasons given for seventh-day Sabbath observance are regarded as no longer valid.[2] When the rest of the chapter is considered in light of this, several reasons for conservation in relation to creation and the seventh-day Sabbath come to the forefront.\\nGod the Creator\\n“The land is Mine,” declares the Lord (Lev. 25:23).[3] This declaration reinforces the Genesis announcement at creation that humans do not actually own the earth, but are its caretakers (cf. Gen. 2:15). In addition, the Leviticus passage points back to Exodus 20:8-11, where the reason given for Sabbath observance is that it is a memorial to God’s creation of the earth. Thus, in recognizing and celebrating the biblical account of creation and Sabbath, Adventists stand on a firm foundation in their biblical theology of conservation. We are never to forget the real owner of this earth, and that we are responsible for its care.\\nWhile it is important to detail stewardship requirements concerning the environment, money, possessions, time, and opportunities, the most crucial principle is God’s ownership of the earth and everything in it. While Adventists continue to recognize the biblical principle of tithing, many seem to think that only the tithe must go to God (Lev. 27:30); in reality, all that we have belongs to God (Ps. 24:1; 1 Chron. 29:14). Indeed, even our bodies are not our own, as we have been bought by Christ’s blood and joined to Him (1 Cor. 6:15-20). Thus, we must treat all of the earth as created by God and belonging ultimately to Him as its Maker.\\nLeviticus 25:2-7 reiterates this principle, as phrases and wording correspond to the fourth commandment of the Decalogue, and parallels are drawn between the resting of the land itself on the seventh year and the command to rest on the seventh day.[4] A closer examination of the passage reveals the symmetrical pattern outlined below. As we review the pattern, it is well to remember that in Hebrew thought, the center message is often the most important theme, and thus the following structure highlights care for the earth and its non-human inhabitants by placing them in the center of the passage:\\nA—The land will keep a Sabbath (shabbat) to Yahweh (v. 2).\\nB— Six years you shall sow (tizra’) your field, and six years you shall prune (tizmor) your vineyard, and gather its fruit (v. 3).\\nC—But in the seventh year there will be a special Sabbath rest (shabbat shabbaton) for the land, a Sabbath (shabbat) to Yahweh (v. 4a).\\nB’—You shall not sow (tizra’) your field, nor prune (tizmor) your vineyard. What grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap, nor gather the grapes of your untended vine (vv. 4b–5a).\\nA’—For it is a year of special rest (shabbaton) for the land. And the Sabbath produce (shabbat) of the land will be to you for food: for you, for your male servants, for your female servants, for your hired help, for the stranger who dwells with you, for your domestic animals (behemah), and for the wild animals (khayah) that are in your land (vv. 5b–7).[5]\\nAs the focus of this passage is the special Sabbath rest for the land, the Sabbath (and sabbatical year) rest and care for creation extends to all that God has made, not just people and animals.[6] Indeed, in 2 Chronicles 36:21, the land was finally able to enjoy the Sabbaths that had been denied to it by disobedient Israel.[7]\\nConservation as a Human Responsibility\\nGod has given the responsibility for the care of the earth to humans. This responsibility includes both stewardship of resources and care for the physical environment. Note the injunction for the sabbatical year: “The land shall keep a sabbath to the LORD. Six years you shall sow your field...but in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath of solemn rest for the land...What grows of its own accord of your harvest you shall not reap” (Lev. 25:2-5).\\nThe command begins with a reminder that humans are to be caretakers of the earth. We are made in God’s image, but the purpose of that is not to exalt ourselves or selfishly exploit the environmental resources under our dominion. Instead humans are to act as God’s representatives on the earth, ruling it as He would if in our place. The Hebrew verbs in Genesis 1:26-28 do not give license to abuse, but demand a just and wise rule over God’s creation.[8] Genesis 2:15 reiterates this principle of environmental stewardship and humanity’s care of the garden by using Hebrew verbs that are normally associated with the priestly care of the temple (e.g., Num. 3:7, 8).\\nAny advantages we gain in this world are only temporary. Hence conservation in the light of the Sabbath and creation must not be seen as a deprivation, but as a call to trust in our heavenly riches. “And if you say, ‘What shall we eat in the seventh year, since we shall not sow nor gather in our produce?’ Then I will command My blessing on you in the sixth year, and it will bring forth produce enough for three years” (Lev. 25:20, 21). The Jubilee year was a special type of sabbatical year, when slaves were freed and land was returned to its original owner. Even more than during the typical sabbatical year, however, anyone who lived off the land would likely be worried about how they were to survive this lengthy period with no agricultural activity. Thus, God reminds the Israelites that He has promised blessing and sustenance to those who are faithful to follow His law and let the land rest, providing sustenance for the poor and the wild animals.\\nIn addition, the care for animals and all of God’s creation in the legal passages of the Pentateuch is a theme that can be traced through the rest of the Bible. Many Old Testament texts imply or allude to this care, while others clearly depict God’s loving concern for His creatures and Israel’s responsibilities to care for and provide rest for animals.[9] In the New Testament, Jesus points to the appropriateness of animal care on the Sabbath day, even when doing so requires what would normally be considered work. He uses that illustration to promote the healing of humans on the Sabbath (Luke 13:15). By mentioning the loosing of oxen from their stalls in order to give them a drink, the passage seems to assume that the oxen were not working on the Sabbath (as commanded in Exo. 20:8-11; 23:10-12; Deut. 5:12-15), but remained in their stalls resting from their labors. So, even in Jesus’ day, the importance of rest and repose for animals on the Sabbath was maintained, reflecting the spirit of Sabbath rest for all creatures shown clearly in the Pentateuch.[10] Humans are held responsible for the state of the earth and all the creatures that live on it (Rom. 8:19-22; Rev. 11:18).\\nConservation as Care for the Less Fortunate\\nLeviticus 25 also provides certain benefits to the less fortunate during the Sabbatical year. The less fortunate include people and animals, as both are more important than profit (see Lev. 25:6, 7). The sabbatical year does not just entail rest for the land, but its yield during that time is to be given to all those who are in need or are oppressed. Thus, helping the poor is more important to God than making money or accumulating possessions (cf. Deut. 26:12-14).\\nLeviticus 25 focuses not only on humans and domestic creatures; strikingly, it includes wild animals as well, so that “no one living in Israel is excluded” from Sabbath rest.[11] The notion of care even for animals farther removed from contact with humans (and that may even pose danger to humans) makes it clear how much God cares for all His creatures. Thus Leviticus 25 extends the benefits of Sabbath rest to the land as well as all life contained on it.[12]\\nThe parallels between Exodus 23:10-12 and Leviticus 25 show the connections of this passage to the Sabbath and the sabbatical year. The Exodus passage has a different pattern, with the themes of the verses concerning Sabbath echoing the previous themes concerning care for the oppressed on the sabbatical year:\\nA—Six (shesh) years you shall sow (tizra’) your land and gather in its produce, but the seventh (shevi’it) year you shall let it rest and lie fallow (v. 10-11a)\\nB—That the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave, the wild animals (khayah) may eat. In like manner you shall do with your vine yard and your olive grove (v. 11b-d).\\nA’—Six (shesh) days you shall do your work, and on the seventh (shevi’i) day you shall rest (v. 12a)\\nB’—in order that your ox and your donkey may rest (nuakh); and your male servant and the stranger may be refreshed (nefesh) (v. 12b).[13]\\nThe reason for this time of rest for the land is that the poor and the wild animals may eat. Thus the Sabbath rest pertains not only to domestic animals, but on some level is applicable to all creatures. The purpose clause used here to describe the reason for the Sabbath (“in order that your ox and your donkey may rest”) shifts the focus from the human head of the household to those who would likely be oppressed: the animals, along with servants and foreigners. The apparent prioritization of animals reflects the focus on care for the downtrodden in Exodus 20-33. Perhaps animals would be the ones most likely to suffer abuse or neglect, even more than servants or strangers, since they cannot speak human language. In addition, the ox and the donkey are specified here, so that these two animals that likely worked the hardest of all during the week would be certain to receive proper Sabbath treatment.[14]\\nUnlike humanity’s Sabbath rest in Exodus 23:12, indicated by the Hebrew verb shabat, the Sabbath rejuvenation for animals is denoted by the word nuakh –the verb that is used for God’s rest in Exodus 20. This special connection between God and animals implies that God places a high value on all His creatures, not just humanity.[15] More than just a cessation of work, the Hebrew verb nuakh often has connotations of repose, tranquility, and even psychological security.[16] Clearly, humanity is responsible for the care of animals, especially to see that they are not oppressed or exploited. Rather than laws focusing solely on humanity, Exodus 21:28–22:13 includes many other laws dealing with animals as well.[17]\\nWe have already noted that Jesus emphasized that animals need rest and repose on the Sabbath and that proper care of animals is the duty of humans. In response to the accusation that His healing ministry on the Sabbath violated the fourth commandment, Jesus countered, “What man is there among you who has one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out?” (Matt. 12:11; see also Luke 14:5 for oxen and donkeys). Jesus argues not only for the rightness of His healing ministry on the Sabbath, but also for the spirit of animal rest and care that is portrayed in the Sabbath commandments of the Pentateuch.[18] His reasoning is actually dependent on the similarities between humans and animals, rather than highlighting the differences. Hence those who rely on animals today for daily work are directly responsible for providing Sabbath rest for them, as well as humane treatment all through the week. The rest of us are also called to protect and care for animals within our sphere of influence, as well as to conserve resources as much as possible, in order to insure that all creatures are not unnecessarily subjected to starvation and exploitation.\\nConservation as a Joyful Response to Redemption\\nIn addition to the celebration of creation and the conservation of the earth and all creatures as essential reasons for the establishment of the Sabbatical year, Leviticus 25 also provides another foundational reason: God’s redemptive activity–“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God” (Lev. 25:38).\\nThe Sabbath commandment in Deuteronomy 5:12-15 also reminds us that one of the two principal reasons for Sabbath keeping is our response to God’s gracious redemption (the other reason being God’s creative activity as mentioned in Exodus 20:8-11). When we conserve the earth and care for animals, we are responding in gratitude to God for His redemption of us. Redeemed people are to imitate their Redeemer God by knowing the desires and necessities of animals under their influence.[19]\\nSeventh-day Adventists have a headstart in animal care not only in their theology of Sabbath and creation, but also in their advocacy of a vegetarian diet. A plant-based diet is one of the very best things humans can do for animals–one vegan saves the lives of at least 95 animals per year.[20] In addition, such a diet is also one of the most powerful contributions humans can make for the environment as a whole: new research shows that meat and dairy production is a major contributor to global warming and worldwide famine.[21]\\nIn reality, we are privileged to practice stewardship. Deuteronomy 14:22- 29 calls for rejoicing when bringing tithes and gifts to God. For that is what tithing and conservation truly are: giving to God and properly caring for what He has given to us in trust, which instills in our hearts a spirit of thankfulness and delight in the God who redeemed us from destruction, and who has given us so many good gifts.\\nConclusion\\nCreation and Sabbath provide key rationale for the continued necessity of earth care. In the biblical theology of conservation, we cannot dismiss care for animals and care for the environment by reasoning that the earth will eventually be “burned up” (2 Pet. 3:10). All living creatures are co-inhabitants of Earth, and as they also depend on its ecosystems for survival, the Bible holds humankind responsible for the preservation of the earth and the care of all living creatures.[22]\\nThus, environmental care is grounded in biblical theology. The Sabbath provides a definitive motivation to care for the earth, especially in light of the biblical account of God’s creation of the earth.[23] Although many care for the earth even though they are not Sabbath-keepers or Christians, Adventists have a special responsibility to be involved with conservation efforts because of their commitment to Scripture, and the close biblical connections between Sabbath, creation, and animal care. In light of this commitment, Adventists believe that conservation is not only necessary, but also a God-given responsibility. We are to care for those less fortunate than us, including animals and all life on Earth, not as a chore, but pouring forth as an offering of thankfulness and joy in our redemption by God. Let the grandeur of God’s created works and His care for all of His creatures keep us humble enough to multiply our conservation efforts, and to leave a legacy of awe and wonder for generations to come.\\nA.

The intensifying sabbath terminology is rare in the Pentateuch and occurs only five other times (Exo. 31:15; 35:2; Lev. 16:31; 23:3, 32), two in relation to the weekly sabbath and two regarding the Day of Atonement. Haag refers to this phrase as “in superlative construction” (“shabbat,” Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament, 14:389).\\n[7] A. Hüttermann connects the sabbatical year with the protection of soil fertility and water availability, stating that the Israelites lived in a land that was not well-suited to agriculture but needed special care. See Hüttermann, The Ecological Message of the Torah: Knowledge, Concepts, and Laws Which Made Survival in a Land of “Milk and Honey” Possible (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1999).\\n[8] These Hebrew words do not mean rule or own, but to act as viceregent, ruling as God would if He were in our place. Recent work confirms this picture of animal care in Pentateuchal law concerning the Sabbath. See Daniel I.

Additionally, in passages like Jonah 4:11 and the flood story (Gen. 6–9), it is obvious that humans are not the only creatures for whom Yahweh shows compassion. No other flood stories in the ancient Near East depict humans or gods caring about and saving the animal world (Hüttermann, The Ecological Message of the Torah, 12-58). Interestingly, certain passages treat/consider animals in ways equal to humans. For instance, in Numbers 8:17, Yahweh seems to consider all the first-born of men and animals as His. Psalm 36:6 states that Yahweh preserves both humans and animals (behemah).

Hartley, Leviticus (Word Biblical Commentary 4; Dallas: Word Books, 1992), 434.\\n[12] Although Lev. 26:31-44 includes the concept of Sabbath rest for the land, animals are not specifically mentioned in relation to Sabbath in this passage. It is important to note that the Hebrew verb in Lev. 26:34, 43 is ratzah (“to restore/make amends”), not nuakh, nafash, or ‘asah (the verbs used for human, animal and divine Sabbath rest in Exo. 20 and Deut. 5). This implies that the land is not actively participating in repose and rejuvenation, but is being restored from human abuse and overuse. In light of this, it seems significant that Lev. 25 also has different terminology for the land’s rest (shabbat shabbaton), and describes the sabbatical year as benefiting humans and animals, not so much the land itself (the verb shabat is used for the land in Lev. 26:35, but in a more passive sense). Thus, it seems that God cares for all of His creation, but that living creatures take priority over plants and land masses.\\n[13] My translation.\\n[14] In fact, in contrast to Exo. 20 and Deut. 5, here animals are the first category of recipients of Sabbath blessings. The different orderings may be related to the focus and emphasis of each passage, and it seems that the mention of specific vulnerable classes emphasizes the universality of the Sabbath. See H. R. Cole, “The Sabbath and the Alien,” Andrews University Seminary Studies 38 (2000):223-229; R.D. Nelson, “Deuteronomy 5:1-15,” Interpretation 41(1988):282-287.\\n[15] Although the Bible is clear that human life is more sacred than animal life (e.g., Gen. 9:5, 6; Lev. 24:21), this does not mean animals are expendable or to be abused. Instead, they are to rest (nuakh) on the Sabbath. Perhaps because this connection between animal rest and God’s rest is so clear in the text, and yet so unexpected in comparison to current modern conceptions of animals, many scholars seem to be surprised that “even animals” are involved in the Sabbath rest. For example, see Carol Meyers, Exodus (New Cambridge Bible Commentary; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 201; V.P. Hamilton, Handbook on the Pentateuch (2nd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2005), 193.\\n[16] Coppes, “nuakh,” Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament, 2:562; Oswalt, “nuakh,” New International Dictionary of Old Testament Theology and Exegesis, 3:58. Many new studies show that humankind knows very little about experiences, emotions, communication, and consciousness of other living things. For example, see F.B.M. DeWaal, The Age of Empathy: Nature’s Lessons for a Kinder Society (New York: Harmony, 2009).\\n[17] In addition to the Sabbath and sabbatical year commands, Exodus and Leviticus provide other statutes pertaining to animals: restitution for stolen animals (Exo. 21:33; Lev. 24:18); care for baby animals (Exo. 22:30); kindness to neighbors and their animals (Exo. 23:4); reasonable burdens for animals to bear (Exo. 23:5); and animal responsibility for actions such as killing and bestiality (Exo. 21:28; 22:18; Lev.18:23; 20:15), etc.\\n[18] G. L. Frear, Jr. notes that “if what is involved in the sabbath rescue of the animal is only prudent husbandry, then the extension to the afflicted human, who of course can wait, does not follow.” See “Caring for Animals: Biblical Stimulus for Ethical Reflection” in Good News for Animals? Christian Approaches to Animal Well-Being, ed. C. Pinches and J.B. McDaniel (Ecology and Justice Series; Maryknoll, NY: Orbis, 1993), 7. Apparently, some rabbis did not condone the rescue of an animal that fell in a pit on the Sabbath, but “they at least allowed it to be made comfortable in the pit,” and thus Jesus “was on common ground with His theological opponents in approving humane action to animals in need.” W.F.

In Prov. 12:10, the one who is righteous is the one who cares for the soul (nefesh) of domestic animals. The noun nefesh is used broadly to describe everything from personhood to specific individual desires. See E. Brotzman, “Man and the Meaning of nefesh,” Bibliotheca Sacra 145 (1988):400-409. More than just making sure the animals live (or are humanely slaughtered), righteous persons know the “soul” (as it were) of their animals: the desires, appetites, inner living being, even emotions, passions and personality (cf.

What may be less well-known is that there are contrastive worldviews generally subsumed under the term “creationism,” and that Christians espousing these worldviews indeed share elements present in “creationism,” but would not necessarily hold all the tenets associated with that term. The purpose of this piece is to: 1) identify the worldview to which the term “creationism” is generally applied, 2) explore contrastive approaches to earth history generally thought to represent “creationism,” and 3) consider two values of a creationist worldview, or what can be called a biblical doctrine of Creation.\\nFull Ussherian Creationism: A Worldview Representing “Creationism”\\nOn the first page of his 17th-century Annals, Bishop Ussher introduces three initial, seminal notions comprising his worldview regarding creation. One, everything except God was created during the six days of creation a few thousand years ago. Two, the spiritual realm and all the angels were created in the dark portion of the first day of creation week. This understanding means that the angels were created before daybreak on what we now call Sunday morning. Three, the literal and historical six day creation week occurred recently on 4004 B.C. This view suggests that the days of creation are interpreted to mean what one can call literal, historical earth days which we experience today, rather than creation days which are interpreted to be so-called literal divine days which translate into millions of years of earth time for each alleged literal divine day of creation.\\nThis view raises some biblical questions that will be discussed below. However, a scientific question also arises at this point for Christians who endorse the concepts noted above. If distant stars in the galactic universe were created only a few thousand years ago, how is it that stars billions of light years distant from planet Earth can be seen by us today? The answer is that contemporary Christians who incorporate these three elements into their model of earth history assume that when the Lord created the distant stars of the galactic universe, He immediately created light waves extending instantly from all the stars to planet Earth, thus permitting humans to see far distant stars whose existence would otherwise be invisible on our planet.\\nThe three elements indicated above constitute what can be called a full Ussherian worldview. This approach to creation represents the single model of earth history that many people associate with the term “creationism.” Many bodies of Christians ascribe to this world view such as, but not limited to, Southern Baptists, the Institute for Creation Research and Answers in Genesis.\\nIn sum, the distinctive hall marks of present day “creationism” or full Ussherian worldview are its claims of 1) a young universe, young earth, young life on earth, and the young existence of angels in the universe, and 2) that on day four of the creation week, God created light beams extending from the far distant stars to planet Earth rendering their existence visible particularly by the humans to be created on day six of creation.\\nContrastive worldviews regarding creation which, on the one hand, hold to a recent creation of life on earth, but which, on the other hand, do not claim that everything but God was created about six thousand years ago, represent models of earth history that may bring confusion to those who associate “creationism” with the full Ussherian view. We turn to a brief description of these contrastive creation approaches to earth history.\\nContrastive Creationist Worldview Generally Thought to Represent Creationism, but to Which the Term Creationism Does Not Properly Apply\\nSome evangelical Christians, such as, but not limited to, Seventh-day Adventists, share several core biblical perspectives found in “creationism” but do not hold to the seminal, hall mark notions of “Ussherian” creationism such as a young universe and the corollary idea that God created light beams on day four of creation week extending from the distant stars to planet Earth. Hence the title “creationism” may cause some confusion when applied to these Christians.\\nHowever, given that these Christians believe in a recent creation, their models of earth history might be described as partial, or semi-Ussherian in nature, and could be designated a creationist worldview or a biblical doctrine of creation as a model of earth history.\\nAs a consequence of accepting a recent creation, also advocated by Ussher, Seventh-day Adventists, for example, hold, among other things, three concepts of central importance which are also shared by contemporary full Ussherian Christians. One, Satan and other fallen angels are not considered to be only metaphors for the demonic. Rather, such entities have real, ontological, personal being and existence apart from human perception and can exert negative influence upon human beings.\\nTwo, the original creation was very good and perfect and free from both natural and moral evils of any kind. However, Satan effectively tempted the first human pair to sin against their Creator, thus introducing death, suffering, pain and predation, extinction, and other natural evils to our planet.\\nThree: A divinely caused judgment flood of global proportions against human sin as described in Genesis 6-9 occurred in earth history. Noah offered sacrifices at the end of the flood, showing that God’s mercy was involved in the event in saving all repentant and believing humans and to finally fulfill His plan of salvation on the cross.\\nThe global nature of the deluge is not only called for by the text, but is important geologically for the following reason. The forming and subsequent sculpting of much, though not all, of the fossil-filled strata of the geologic column occurred during the rising and receding waters of the flood.\\nHowever, as distinct from full Ussherian Christians, Seventh-day Adventists officially endorse the biblical teaching that during the creation week, an already existing universe of created, morally free beings rejoiced as God created the first living creatures on this earth a few thousand years ago (Job 2; 38:4-8; Rev 12:7-9). Hence, Adventists believe in an ancient universe, but recent life on earth and a great conflict or controversy between Christ and Satan over the inhabitants of this planet. Many Adventists are open to the notion that the God-created inorganic matter of this planet may have been in existence for long ages prior to the creation week (Gen 1:2).\\nIn the contemporary scientific world dominated by Huttonian and Darwinian concepts of deep time geology and macro-evolutionary theory, both creationism and a creationist worldview carry two key benefits. First, they pose a God of high moral character, in contrast to Darwinian evolutionary theory, which introduces a new temporal method of creation of life forms over millions of years through death, disease, predation, pain and suffering and extinction. Such a method of creation carries fatal implications for the goodness of God if His original creation of life forms is linked to this blundering, wasteful and horridly cruel method of “creation.” If the Creator uses the Darwinian principles as His method of creation, then He is like a demon unworthy of worship.\\nFortunately, in His final love call to planet Earth, recorded in Revelation 14:7c the Creator urges us to “worship him who made the heaven, earth, sea and the fountains of waters.” The words “who made the heaven, earth, sea” form a definite allusion to the same words in the fourth commandment of Exodus 20:ll, which says that “in six days the Lord made heaven, earth and the sea . . .” Thus the “him” of Revelation 14:7c is the Lord of Exodus 20:11. This reaffirms the earth history truth that the “him” of Revelation 14, which we are to worship, created the original life forms on earth in six days rather than in millions of years. This consequence means that the Creator created benignly and is thus good and worthy of human worship. This is the first great benefit of believing in the biblical doctrine of Creation. But what about the fossil-filled geologic column? Does it destroy any possibility of a recent creation, and that, therefore, God, if connected to a long age method of creation, must indeed be demonic?\\nThe answer to this crucial challenge is found in the use of the term “fountains of waters” (Rev 14:7c) in the context of the divine judgment message of the passage. This phrase recalls a previous divine event of judgment in terms of the global flood. God’s reaffirmation, in His final message to humanity in the 21st century, of the reality of the global flood encourages geologists and all of us to factor the action of the global flood into the model of earth history. Many believing geologists are convinced from field evidence that the actions of the rising waters of the flood account for much of the forming of basic portions, though not all, of the geologic column. In addition, the actions of the receding waters of the flood account for some, not all, of the streamlined landforms and vast marks of erosion visible on the surface of the planet Earth today. Hence, a recent six day creation is possible since during the global flood, vast portions of the geologic column formed rapidly and after the entrance of sin. This makes possible a recent creation and hence a good Creator worthy of worship. These consequences comprise the first great benefit of a creationist view toward origins.\\nThe second profound benefit of a creationist or a biblical doctrine of a recent six-day creation along with the global flood relates to the gospel of salvation in terms of the cross of Christ and the atonement as follows. The wages or penalty of sin is death (Gen 2:17; Rom 5:12; 6:23; 8:20-21). This sin-death causality is the foundation of the atonement, in that on the cross Jesus bore our penalty and died. However, if the geologic column is a rock record of how God created over millions of years, rather than a rock record of how God punished human sin recently via a global flood, then death in the geologic column shown by the fossils existed long before the first human sin thus undermining the sin-death causality and hence refuting the death of Christ as being the wage of sin for us. This shows how the atonement, the gospel, the centrality of the cross of Christ is undermined if the long age method of creation is correct.\\nHowever, the biblical doctrine of a recent creation and the action during a global flood show that there was no death before sin and that, therefore, the gospel, the atonement, the efficacy of the cross of Christ, is preserved. This is the second great benefit and value of a creationist worldview.\\nConclusion\\nWhile the word “creationism” is often used to cover all forms of belief in the biblical doctrine of creation, it is widely understood to refer to a full Ussherian doctrine of creation. This worldview holds that the entire galactic universe including the spiritual realm of all the angels were created a few thousand years ago. In addition, God created light beams from distant stars to this earth during creation week.\\nHowever, other evangelical Christians such as the Seventh-day Adventists, do not hold the above distinctive views regarding creation and so should not be confused with those believing in (Ussherian) “creationism,” but rather recognized as holding a doctrine of Creation in which the first life forms on earth were created recently within a few thousand years during a brief span of six earth days.\\nInterestingly, Seventh-day Adventists, along with many other evangelical groups hold in common with Christians who believe in “Ussherian” creationism, that an ontologically real Satan and fallen angels effected the historical fall of our first parents into sin, which was followed eventually by a divine global flood because of the great wickedness of humans.\\nThe two-fold benefits of a creationist, or biblical doctrine of creation are deep. First, the good, worship-worthy character of God is preserved by Revelation 14:7c by showing that God created in six days rather than over millions of years of death and suffering, and so on, which, if true, would render Him a demon. During the global flood, whose reality is suggested by the phrase “fountains of waters,” basic portions, but not necessarily all, of the geologic column were formed after the entrance of sin, thus showing that a recent creation is possible which affirms the good worship-worthy character of the Creator.\\nSecond, the gospel of the cross of Christ is preserved by a recent creation followed by a fall and a global flood. During the flood large numbers of creatures were entombed rapidly into the geologic column after the historical fall of our first parents showing that sin existed before death. This means that the atonement and the gospel are preserved.\\nThese consequences show some of the central values of a biblical creation worldview.\\n\\xa0\\nJohn T.

As evolutionist David Hull rightly observes: “The God implied by evolutionary theory is not a loving God who cares about His productions . . . [He] is careless, wasteful, indifferent, almost diabolical. He is certainly not the sort of God to whom anyone would be inclined to pray.”[i] The worship-worthiness of God is at stake here in the method of creation God uses. The biblical, benign, six-day Creation renders God a good Creator worthy of worship, and not Darwin’s cruel Devil who creates savagely over long ages.[ii] This means that the seventh-day Sabbath is a memorial of a method of Creation which establishes the worship-worthiness of our Creator.A Creator Able to Justly Forgive SinsThe Sabbath is also a memorial of the sin-forgiving power of the Creator. Deep-time evolutionary theory requires that not only the animals, but even Adam and Eve were under the curse of physical death from the beginning. In this model, death did not enter planet Earth through the disobedience of our first parents, as indicated, for instance, in Romans 8:20-21 and Romans 5:12. Theologian Nigel Cameron observes that this circumstance “overthrows the sin-death causality, and in so doing pulls the rug from under the feet of the evangelical understanding of the atonement.”[iii] If deep-time evolutionary theory is true, the death of Christ on the cross is not the wage of sin. However, if a six-day Creation is true, death in all living things appears after human sin meaning that the sin-death causality is preserved and the blood of Christ still forgives sins.The Fossil Record and the Global Biblical FloodThe biblical model of a recent, death-free, six-day Creation is dismissed by those who consider the fossiliferous geologic column as the record of millions of years of evolutionary history. However, the biblical account of a global flood resulting in massive destruction of life neutralizes the deep-time geologic criticism based on the fossil record. A global biblical flood responsible for the accumulations of fossil-bearing strata disentangles the six-day Creation from the contention of a preceding record of death, and thus preserves the sin-death causality and the efficacy of the Cross to justly forgive our sins (Rom 3:25; 1 John 1:9). To those skeptical about considering the biblical Flood in the construction of geological models of earth history, Leonard Brand offers these instructive comments: “To use our biblical worldview as a basis for scientific predictions is compatible with the scientific process because it does exactly what science is supposed to do. It puts our theories and hypothesis out in the open to be discussed, to be supported by accumulating evidence, or refuted by the evidence.”[iv]ConclusionThis brief discussion suggests that the Sabbath is thereby a weekly memorial of a benign method of Creation showing that the Creator is worthy of worship. Secondly, the Sabbath is also a memorial of the truth of the sin-death causality and the power of the Creator to justly forgive our sins. The truth about the six-day Creation, testified by the Sabbath, encourages us all to worship our Maker joyfully with the deepest conviction possible and with thankful praise without end.John T.

October 31 will mark 500 years since Martin Luther strode through the crisp autumn air of Wittenberg’s streets, making his way toward the Castle Church. Clutched in his hand were nails, a hammer and a revolutionary document. Arriving at the Church’s large wooden doors, Luther nailed up the document we now call, “The Ninety-Five Theses.”Without the ideas expressed in Luther’s 95-Theses, we would not be celebrating Creation Sabbath this week. I want to draw your attention to just two of the 95-Theses. In the 27th thesis, Luther quotes a catch phrase used by those selling papal indulgences:“[A]s soon as the money clinks into the money chest, the soul flies out of purgatory.”\\r\\n“daß die Seele (aus dem Fegefeuer) emporfliege, sobald das Geld im Kasten klingt.”The 95-Theses were a response to the sale of Papal indulgences that were being sold to finance the building of St. Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican. Customers were assured that these indulgences had the power to liberate souls from purgatory, sending them straight to Heaven.To counter this evil scam, Luther appealed to something that had become far removed from the life of the average Christian—God’s Word. There is nothing at all in the Bible about paying for indulgences, salvation is by God’s grace, a free gift!Returning the source of authority in Christianity from the Pope to the Bible led to a restoration of the doctrines central to biblical Christianity. The Bible in the hands of believers lead by the Holy Spirit powered the Protestant Reformation and it is the power of God’s Word that sustains the Church today. Protestant Christians embrace Luther’s famous Latin dictum “Sola Scriptura.” It is God’s Word alone that has authority, not tradition, not what we think, not what some “expert” thinks. The Bible and the Bible alone forms the foundation of Protestant Christian beliefs, understanding of the world and hope for the future.The second thesis we will look at is Luther’s 62nd:“The true treasure of the church is the most holy gospel of the glory and grace of God.”\\r\\n“Der wahre Schatz der Kirche ist das allerheiligste Evangelium von der Herrlichkeit und Gnade Gottes.”What is this “true treasure of the Church” that Luther talked about? It is something that is explicitly denied by many in the world in which we live. The claim is made that humans are exclusively the product of our environment and genetics. If we do evil things, it is not our fault, it is just the way we are. Our lusts, our inclinations, our desires and ultimately our actions are beyond our control, so we cannot be judged in any way for them because we cannot change ourselves.But Jesus Christ, our Creator, rejected this way of thinking:“Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin.  And a slave does not abide in the house forever, but a son abides forever. Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.” John 8:34-36 NKJVWe may not be able to change ourselves, but our Creator, if we let Him, can change us! It is worth considering the context of this text. Those who were confronting Jesus claimed to be heirs of Abraham and never slaves to anyone. This was after Jesus had told them that “the truth shall make you free” (John 8:32 NKJV).The Jews of that time were filled with pride and blinded to their pitiful sinful state. Jesus, “the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6 NKJV) stood before them offering them true liberation, something totally transforming. He could do that because “All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made” (John 1:3 NKJV). Human beings are not products of a cold uncaring universe, subject to whatever chance way we happened to turn out. Humans, and all of nature, are creations of the God who “is love” (1 John 4:8 NKJV).God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth came down and was with us, and He is with us now, in every heart that is open to Him. Our Father, Our Creator has not abandoned us, He has adopted us! Just as Adam was His son, through Jesus Christ and unspeakable grace, we are a new creation, born again as His children. No wonder the Apostle John exclaimed:\"Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God.\" John 3:1 KJVHow can we explain this? Isn’t the Gospel incomprehensibly good? Because God is our Creator, of course He can and will make us a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). This logic of salvation cannot be improved upon and is fundamental to the Christian understanding of human nature, the world and all of reality. No wonder Martin Luther was so firm and clear as he championed of the biblical creation as it is recorded in Scripture. To abandon the reality of creation is to abandon reality itself, including the reality of salvation. Luther would tolerate none of that. Because he understood the infinite value and Truth of Scripture, he wrote:“When Moses writes that God created heaven and earth and whatever is in them in six days, then let this period continue to have been six days, and do not venture to devise any comment according to which six days were one day. But, if you cannot understand how this could have been done in six days, then grant the Holy Spirit the honor of being more learned than you are. For you are to deal with Scripture in such a way that you bear in mind that God Himself says what is written. But since God is speaking, it is not fitting for you wantonly to turn His word in the direction you wish to go.”\\r\\n(What Luther Says. A Practical In-Home Anthology for the Active Christian. Compiled by Ewald M. Plass. St. Louis, Missouri: Concordia 1959. p 1523.)Luther was probably more concerned about people who wished to claim that the creation occurred in a single instant rather than over six days, as the Bible records. Today there are those who wish to deny the creation all together, or stretch it out of eons of suffering death and struggle for survival.What is wrong with the Biblical account? Nothing, it is true, it makes sense and ultimately is central to the Gospel. Our Creator has already demonstrated that He can create us, and the creation of our Earthly father, Adam, was not the result of any works of his own. Adam’s creation was and our creation is an act of pure grace on God’s part. How evil it would be to twist the creation into a Darwinian struggle for survival in which, through the works of our dead ancestors, we have come to the glorious state we enjoy today! What kind of gospel would it be that offers us a perfect body, mind and soul through a million future deaths as we evolve to perfection? Where is the grace in that?Ultimately, the creation was a fundamental pillar of the Reformation because it is a fundamental theme of Scripture and fundamental to the Gospel. No wonder the first article of Martin Luther’s short and long catechisms is:“I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth.”\\r\\n(Martin Luther. The Large Catechism. Translated by F. Bente and W.H.T. Dau. Published in: Triglot Concordia: The Symbolical Books of the Ev. Lutheran Church. St. Louis: Concordia Publishing House, 1921. pp. 565-773)All Bible-believing Christians believe in and worship our Creator. Because the creation is true and necessary, the creation makes sense of reality and is at the center of the Gospel. The Gospel is that, just like the creation of our father Adam, our new creation, our adoption as sons of our Heavenly Father, is an act of pure and astonishing grace. In short: no creation, no grace and no Gospel. Thank God the creation is what actually happened and the Gospel is a beautiful reality!by Timothy G.

      "['Have you ever heard someone claim that they are in two minds about something? That usually means they can’t make up their mind about a complex issue;  but how many minds can a person really have? Possibly you’re in two–maybe three–minds about that question, but what if we were to ask how many brains a person has? It turns out that it could be more than one! When we think of our brain, we visualize the amazingly complex organ that sits inside our skull, but there is an intricate system of nerves that serves as the “brain” of our digestive system. This complex of around half a billion nerves regulates things like peristaltic contractions that move digesting food through the system. Think of how complex getting that right actually is. If the food moves too fast, enzymes will not have time to break it down and there will not be enough time to absorb nutrients. At the same time, you don’t want half-digested food sitting around in your bowels for longer than is necessary! Getting the speed of contractions correct requires integrating input from sensors in the gut, correctly deciding what to do, then sending output with the correct instructions to muscles surrounding the different parts of the digestive system.The “abdominal brain”—technically called the “enteric nervous system” or ENS—is involved in far more than just control of peristaltic contractions, it also communicates with the microbiome of the gut, regulates blood flow, synchronizes the excretion of enzymes and interacts with the immune system, and it operates independently of the brain in our head. Recent research conducted by Khomgrit Morarach and colleagues at the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, has discovered some of the complexity and subtlety of this remarkable system.[1] Using recently developed technology that allows sequencing of all the RNAexpressed in individual cells, they were able to identify 12 different subtypes of nerve cells doing different tasks in the abdominal brain, but all working together.The enteric nervous system exists out of sight, and all its activity happens without us even knowing about it. But just because it is out of mind doesn’tmean that it is dispensable. This remarkable system of nerves appears to be essential for humans and other vertebrates. It illustrates a common phenomenon in biology. Whenever we are tempted to think that something is simple enough that we understand it, it turns out that we have not really thought through all that is essential for the organ or system to work. As Christians, we can be in one mind about our Creator, who did think through every elegant part of us, then created our bodies–and those of every other living thing–fully formed to function and thrive in the world that He created for us. Only He knows what wonders lie still hidden within us and other organisms, wonders that still await our discovery using the brains in our heads!.', 'Summary. Fossil crane flies with well-preserved eyes were recovered from the Fur Formation, a famous Eocene deposit in Denmark containing large concentrations of fossils. The fossils were examined for their chemical and microanatomy. Crane flies, like many other insects, have compound eyes with hundreds of individual units called ommatidia. Space between the individual ommatidia in the fossil material contained the pigment eumelanin. Most animals use melanins to shield their eyes from light coming from outside the field of view, but arthropods were thought to be an exception. Examination of the fossil eyes showed they had become calcified during preservation. Crane fly eyes are not calcified, so the discovery that the fossil crane flies are calcified raises questions about the eyes of trilobites, which are thought to have been composed of calcite crystals in life. If the calcite in trilobite eyes is due to fossilization processes and not original in living organisms, this would greatly change our view of trilobite eye structure.Comment. This discovery speaks to both catastrophe and design. Fossil concentrations (“lagerstatten”) are clearly produced by catastrophic conditions, and the exceptional preservation of the crane fly eyes shows that fossilization occurred rapidly. Design is seen in the structure of the eye, with its hundreds of individual ommatidia and their separation by the light-absorbing pigment eumelanin. Preservation of the pigment, a biological molecule, provides further evidence of rapid fossilization of the crane flies. If the report is correct in its suggestion that trilobite eyes might originally have been chitinous rather than calcitic, this would cast doubt on the long-standing explanation of the design of the trilobite eye with a special corrective structure to compensate for the refraction of light as it passes through the calcitic lens of the trilobite.', 'There are things for which the whole is just the sum of its parts. A dozen apples is just the sum of twelve apples, nothing more, nothing less. A century is an exact count of one hundred years. Quantities seem to be the prime example of a whole that solely consists of the sum of its parts. But take something like letters in a word, or words in a paragraph. Clearly, a word is more than the mere quantity of letters of which it consists. A word has a meaning attached to it. And when grammar and semantics are involved, a sequence of words also conveys meaning. Thus, there are, of course, things for which the whole is more than the sum of its parts. But why? Where does the meaning of words and sentences come from? We could tentatively suggest that a thought process, distinct from the words themselves, is necessary to attach meaning to a certain sequence of letters and retrieve it whenever this sequence appears at a later time. To better understand the distinctiveness of what helps to make an entity more than the sum of its parts, consider an incandescent light bulb. The main purpose for which light bulbs were invented and designed was illumination. However, a bulb is totally nonfunctional, unless it is connected to a socket in which a potential difference between two poles creates a current that flows through the filament of the bulb. The bulb can accomplish its intended purpose (illumination) only through the specific kind of energy that we call electricity. The whole (lamp bulb) is designed to assume a specific function in the presence of a constituent that is exterior to it, an exogenous essential element (EEE) without which the bulb cannot function. The bulb cannot illuminate anything, unless there is electricity flowing through it. Let us consider a car as another example. The first car that I bought was a VW “beetle,” because it was the cheapest in the market. I purchased it before I was able to drive. My dad did not drive anymore, and none of my older siblings had a driver’s license yet. That car stayed in the garage of my parents’ house for months before I could use it brand new, out of the factory, no mechanical problem, but motionless. Cars were invented to serve as means of transportation. Their intricately designed parts must all work in harmony to function properly, in many cases providing examples of irreducibly complex systems. Nevertheless, no matter how perfect – and indispensable – these designed parts may be, a car needs an operator to accomplish the purpose of transportation.What starts the engine to begin the process is not part of the car. Once again, the whole becomes more than just the sum of its parts in the presence of an EEE. Even in advanced “driverless” versions, a car needs information provided by an agent about when, where, and how to go to places. A separate act of volition is required for cars to be useful.When we shift our attention to the question of the origin of living beings, a search for real answers entails more than just explaining how intricate biomolecular systems originated. It requires the crucial acknowledgement that a living being is more than the collection of the multitude of organic components of which it is made. Even a single-celled organism is more than the sum of its proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, DNAs, RNAs it is a living entity.It  is true that life “happens” in an environment in which we have all those intricately designed complex systems, but the system itself is not life. Lifeoccurs in the presence of an EEE – like the potential difference or intelligent operator in our imperfect lamp bulb and car analogies – without which all the molecules of life wouldn’t be alive.Long ago, Pasteur already demonstrated scientifically that only life can generate life – there is no such thing as spontaneous generation of life from non-living matter. Therefore, to assume the primeval first living organism arose from inorganic matter without the interposition of a previous life, as the followers of Charles Darwin wish, is going against a proven scientific fact.That life is more than the biomolecules of living organisms is illustrated in a message God gave Ezekiel amidst a valley full of dry bones “So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and suddenly a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to bone. Indeed, as I looked, the sinews and the flesh came upon them, and the skin covered them over; but there was no breath in them. Also, He said to me, ‘Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, ‘Thus says the Lord God, “Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they may live.” ’ So I prophesied as He commanded me, and breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet, an exceedingly great army” (Ezekiel 371-14; NKJV, emphasis added). This breath (or EEE, if you wish), God later explains in verse 14, is the Holy Spirit “I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live” (NKJV, emphasis added).Similarly, we are told that in the beginning “the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being” (Genesis, 27; NKJV). When God formed Adam from the dust of the earth, he was non-living matter; only when God ‘breathed into his nostrils the breath of life,’ Adam ‘became a living being.’Life is more than body parts –bones, muscles, sinews, organs, tissues, cells, mitochondria, DNA and RNA. It is a dynamic reality with meanings attached for those who can read. If we recognize that an Intelligence provided the EEE for life with a purpose in mind, we shall live our lives to their fullest.', 'Undeniable was certainly the foremost book advocating Intelligent Design (ID) published in 2016, steadily ranking in the top ten “Amazon Best Sellers” in the categories Creationism, Developmental Biology, and Organic Evolution. If a mousetrap was the key iconic illustration of Behe’s now classic ID book Darwin’s Black Box, omelets would be my pick for the most compelling image conveying the core message of Undeniable. The mousetrap helped explain how the irreducible complexity of biological systems, where all parts are simultaneously needed for the whole to work, was a hallmark of ID. In Undeniable, Axe makes a similar point by arguing that even simple tasks, like fixing an omelet, require a sequence of hierarchically organized steps that would never occur by chance alone in the whole universe in billions of years. Intelligent beings and their know- how are necessary to implement the highly improbable combination of steps that bring into existence functional things. This principle fittingly applies to Undeniable, where the reasoning of a very intelligent being (Douglas Axe) becomes accessible to us through the careful arrangement of words on a written page. Indeed, the intellectual stature of its author is one of the incentives to read this book. Apart from graduating and doing research at such prestigious institutions as UC Berkeley, Caltech, and University of Cambridge, Axe has co-authored papers published in peer-reviewed journals such as PNAS and Journal of Molecular Biology. Therefore, in Undeniable we have the rare privilege of hearing a sympathetic argument for ID and God as Creator from an expert scientist who has actually worked and experimented with biomolecular systems in top-notch biology labs. Axe’s life in academia while holding onto convictions different than the standard evolutionary consensus is one of the four main threads that intertwine in the chapters of the book. When Axe shares the ostracism and rejection experienced when his convictions came under the scrutiny of his peers, we sense the suffering and emotional scars caused by discrimination, although Axe strives to be fair and detached in his recollections.The second and major thread in the book is the apologetic dimension, where Axe builds logical arguments through the use of illustrations and carefully crafted propositions. The main ideas addressed with this systematic approach are a) the basis for our innate ability to infer that something is designed and why this intuition is so powerful; b) the reason why natural selection cannot generate novelty in biological organisms; c) the reason why chance is also not a good candidate for the creation of biological complexity (this section includes an extended discussion of probability); d) the concept of functional coherence, defined as the precise arrangement and interrelation of the subcomponents of working systems. The points discussed are reinforced by summaries at the beginning of each chapter, boxes highlighting particularly important sentences, and simple but effective figures graphically representing aspects mentioned in the text. The third thread revolves around Axe’s specific field of expertise, the study of the structure of proteins and how changes in the sequence of amino acids that make them can affect the folding and consequent functionality of the proteins. Axe intersperses examples and results from his research throughout the book, in order to buttress his more general arguments about chance, natural selection, and design. His experiments seem to suggest that evolving new functions by random changes in the amino-acid chains of existing proteins is probabilistically highly unlikely, not to mention the astronomically low probability to get a functional protein from scratch. Evolutionary mechanisms (random mutation and selection) seem effective in optimizing functionality in pre-existing proteins (a process called selective optimization), but this is more analogous to the fine-tuning of a complex system than the construction of its subcomponents. The fourth and final thread in Axe’s book can be described as lyrical and exhortative. Especially in the final part of the book, Axe reaches out to the reader, openly sharing his faith in God and expressing his marvel and appreciation for the richness and beauty of life. Some passages using this register are very powerful and touching. I especially liked his description in chapter 14 of the human brain as a connecting point in the vast universe “between the immense realm of things and the infinite realm of thoughts. [...] These connecting points are the places – the only places – where the world of atoms and the world of ideas are made to shake hands.” Although the book is intended for a general readership and is full of effective analogies and illustrations (including the aforementioned omelets, but also alphabet soup, pool-cleaning robots, and the Apollo 13 mission), the writing is conceptually dense. Axe has a great ability to crystallize concepts with memorable language, making many passages of his book very “quotable.” However, some sections require a certain dose of concentration to follow the buildup of the argument through different chapters. One subject where it would be interesting to have a deeper conversation with Axe is his opinion on the amount of change in created species. From what I could gather from the book, Axe seems to hold to a very high view of present diversity and animal behavior as divinely intended. For him, the saga of salmons being predated by orcas while embarking with determination in their journey to reach spawning waters perfectly fulfills God’s purpose and design. In conclusion, I found Undeniable to be an honest, eloquent, sharp, and uncompromising critique of the evolutionary paradigm for the origin and diversification of life and a well-articulated presentation of the Intelligent Design argument. Axe and his candor will be inspiring for students and scholars alike, and I would especially recommend this book for college students who are struggling to understand how to incorporate scientific knowledge in a Christian worldview. Axe’s personal example of being a scientist who does excellent research while maintaining a positive Christian attitude and integrity of faith will act as a powerful encouragement in the life of many. I like to think that one day, our Creator and Designer will consider the fruits of this book and proudly say to Douglas Axe “Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord” (Matthew 2521).', 'Imagine walking down the beach and coming across the words “Romeo loves Juliet” written in the sand. Most of us have experienced something like this and would not be surprised, but most people would be surprised to find the entire text of William Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet written in sand. Why is this? The obvious reason is that sand is the wrong material for large writing projects. Sand grains move about easily and text written in it is quickly obliterated (Figure 1). Before the first act was completely written in sand, the beginning may be gone if the wind is blowing or waves wash over it. On the other hand, it is not surprising to find Romeo and Juliet written out on paper. Because it is compact and lasts for many years, paper is an excellent material for storing information. We could write information on other materials – over the course of history, humans have employed everything from rocks to parchment made from sheep skins as information storage media – but cheap abundant long-lasting paper has proven to be one of the best media ever invented for storing information.  DNA – The stable genetic information storage medium Inside cells, we find an information storage medium that, like paper, appears to be just the right medium for the information it stores; we call it Deoxyribonucleic Acid or DNA. One reason DNA is an excellent storage medium for genetic data is its amazing chemical stability. DNA can last for thousands of years after an organism has died, and this has allowed us to read the DNA of long extinct organisms ranging from our Neanderthal relatives[1] to woolly mammoths.[2] Chemical stability is essential to the function of DNA. If it were unstable, the information that it encodes would be quickly degraded, like information written in sand. DNA – An efficient storage medium Our own DNA illustrates another essential attribute of DNA. The human genome comprises all our DNA packaged into the 23 human chromosomes, two copies of which are found in most cells,[3] as well as DNA within mitochondria. DNA stores information far more efficiently than printed words on paper. For example, human mitochondrial DNA is only about 5.6 μm long–about one hundredth the diameter of a typical period at the end of a sentence–but printed out as letters on paper, its DNA sequence takes up about 6 pages. Similarly, the entire human genome is about a meter long but requires around a million pages to print out! Clearly a million pages will not fit inside a cell, but all that information will fit inside the tiny nucleus of a cell if it is encoded in DNA. The ability of DNA to store information in a tiny space makes it the most efficient known information storage medium in terms of information density. DNA – An accurately copied medium The double helical structure of DNA also contributes in an amazing way to its function as an information storage medium. When most cells divide, it is necessary to make a complete copy of the DNA in the “mother” cell so that each “daughter” cell gets one complete copy of the mother cell’s DNA. Information is encoded in DNA using sequences of chemicals called nucleotide bases. These bases are analogous to the letters we use to spell out information and a complete copy of the human genome contains about 3 billion of them. When human cells divide, the challenge is to accurately copy 6 billion bases because each mother cell contains two copies of the human genome. Humans start out as a single fertilized egg cell, which divides until a person reaches the adult number of cells, which is around 37 trillion.[4] As adults, our cells continue to divide and grow as we lose old cells, so millions of cells in our bodies divide every day and thus millions of copies of the 6 billion bases in each cell’s DNA must be accurately made. While the number of DNA replications and the 3 billion base length of the human genome may seem impressive, this is not exceptional. Many other organisms, ranging from maize to some salamanders, have significantly larger genomes. The largest animal genome reported is for the marbled lungfish, Protopterus aethiopicus, with 139 billion bases in its genome, but organisms with even larger genomes are known.[5] When James Watson and Francis Crick published their seminal 1953 paper[6] revealing the double helical structure of DNA to the world, they immediately noted that the structure suggests a mechanism for accurate DNA replication It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material. The pairing Watson and Crick are referring to involves the chemical base “letters” of the DNA alphabet already mentioned. These flat molecules are attached to the two strands of the double helix. As the two strands of the double helix wind around each other, the bases point into the center and interact with one another in very specific ways. One class of bases, the purine bases Adenine (A) and Guanine (G), is relatively large; while the other class, the pyrimidine bases Thymine (T) and Cytosine (C), are smaller. In addition, charges on the surface of these bases are distributed differently. Because of this and the geometry of DNA with the bases pointing toward each other, Adenine (A) on one strand of the double helix always pairs up with Thymine (T) on the opposite strand and vice versa. The same is true for Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C). Thus, if you have an A on one strand of the double helix, you can know that there is a T on the opposite strand, and if you have a C on one strand, you can know that there is G on the opposite strand. If the double helix is unzipped to make individual strands of DNA, each strand contains a negative copy of the opposite strand. When DNA is replicated, the DNA double helix is unzipped and each strand serves as the template for making an exact copy of the other strand. Obviously there is complex cellular machinery that makes this happen, but if one strand has the sequence AGTCCGC, then the opposite strand can be reconstructed exactly from it as TCAGGCG.[7] Thus it is that the structure of DNA contributes to the amazing way it can be replicated with almost inconceivable speed and accuracy. The origin of DNA as the genetic material of organisms The more we learn about DNA, the better suited it appears to its role as an information storage medium inside cells. We have talked about three ideal characteristics that it exhibits 1) It is chemically stable and thus does not rapidly degrade the information stored in it, 2) DNA is amazingly information dense, storing massive quantities of information in an incredibly small volume; 3) The structure of DNA contributes to its ability to be accurately copied at amazing speed, which is necessary when cells are dividing to make new cells. There are other characteristics that DNA exhibits that make it ideal, but discussing them gets progressively more technical and these three are sufficient to illustrate the point. There may be some other materials that could do some of what DNA does, but none are known that fulfill all the requirements of a genetic material as well as DNA does. This raises the question of how organisms ended up using DNA rather than some inferior molecule to store genetic information. For the open-minded there are at least two possibilities, either DNA was chosen as the genetic material by someone who knew what they were doing, or DNA was chosen as the genetic material by something that didn’t know what it was doing. The latter position is the materialistic belief of Darwinism. How might this have worked? Given the amazing fit between the properties of DNA and its function, and the diverse molecules made by organisms, it is hard to imagine nature arrived at this solution on its first attempt. Something had to be the initial genetic material and then various other solutions to the need for a genetic material were tried until natural selection settled on the essentially ideal solution of DNA. There is a significant problem with this Darwinian scenario. Darwin pointed out that for his mechanism to work, it must proceed by “by numerous, successive, slight modifications.”[8] However, changing genetic materials, even with relatively small changes to the chemicals involved, is not possibly a slight modification from the perspective of the organism. An analogy might be trying to swap out the hard disk of a computer for paper, or information chiseled into rock. Information is stored in the form of different magnetic states on hard drives, the equipment to retrieve that information must match the medium it is stored in. Thus, the heads that read changes in magnetic state on a hard disk are incapable of reading ink on paper or letters carved into stone. The same is true of the equipment used by cells to read information from the genetic material of cells. Today we can study the machinery found inside cells and see that we can’t substitute a different kind of molecule for DNA. Molecules like polysaccharides, triglycerides or proteins – all of which are naturally made inside cells – are not particularly good information storage media, but even if they were, they are not read by the machinery that reads DNA. We can also see that devices capable of reading different media are a complex engineering challenge, but creating a device flexible enough to read multiple media is orders of magnitude more difficult. This is why when the transition was made from optical drives to USB drives no attempt was made to create systems that read both; they are read by different devices inside computers. To go with the materialistic scenario involving multiple genetic materials, one needs mechanisms for reading the stored information in different media that somehow anticipate the need to read it before it is being used. In reality, switching genetic materials, even switching between fairly closely related chemicals, requires a coordinated change in several molecular machines inside cells, something that seems quite remarkable in any system, let alone a system that is unguided in any way. The alternative theory, that DNA was chosen as the genetic material by someone who knew what they were doing, can be compared with our normal experience. One of the first things engineers look at when presented with an engineering problem is the materials available and a decision is made about which materials will best serve the purposes of the problem they seek to address. For example, when designing a car engine, an engineer needs to use materials that can withstand the heat and mechanical strain inside the engine. Water is not the right material for an engine block, neither is wood or concrete; certain metals work very well for this purpose, so these metals are the materials most commonly used. Engineers know the specifications of the project being worked on and the specifications of the materials available. They then match the material exhibiting the necessary specifications with the project at hand. This observation fits well with our understanding of DNA as the genetic material; it is well explained within the paradigm of a wise Designer who chose an ideal material for the purpose of storing genetic information within the organisms He created. Satisfied with this choice, and many others, He could thus pronounce at the completion of His creation that it was “very good.”[9] There is clearly an argument to be made for design in living things based on the choice of DNA as the genetic material, but what about the information encoded in DNA? Christians believe God created living things and is the ultimate source of information in genomes. In contrast, the most common alternative theory of origins–materialistic Darwinism–attributes genomic information to chance mutations and natural laws, particularly natural selection. Let’s look at two attributes of genomes that shed light on their origin and ultimately the origin of life. Is much of the information coded in DNA actually junk? Our understanding of genomes was held back by the rush to declare most of many genomes “junk.”[10] Susumu Ohno, who coined the term “junk DNA,” elegantly expressed this Darwinian viewpoint The earth is strewn with fossil remains of extinct species; is it a wonder that our genome too is filled with the remains of extinct genes?[11] Much DNA does not code for proteins, and many biologists initially assumed that these non-coding DNA sequences therefore lacked function. The logic boiled down to, “if we don’t know what it does, it must do nothing.” However, much data now demonstrate that this logic leads to a false conclusion non-coding DNA often exhibits important functions. This understanding has revolutionized how biologists view genomes. Instead of vast deserts with occasional oases of functional information, genomes now seem more like rainforests of information with a dazzling array of genes, control mechanisms and logic circuits. Genes are smarter than we thought According to the “one gene, one enzyme” model proposed by Beadle and Tatum (for which they won a Nobel Prize), each gene codes for a single protein; but now everything has changed. Current estimates indicate that humans have less than 25,000 genes, but produce more than 100,000 proteins;[12] thus at least some genes must be capable of producing multiple proteins. How does the cell “know” when to make one form of a protein but not others? This brings us back to some of what was once dismissed as “junk” DNA and indicates why genomes are now understood to be far more dynamic than initially imagined. The complex systems controlling exon splicing appear to involve sequences occupying at least one third of the human genome,[15] far exceeding the 3 % of the human genome thought to be functional a few years ago. The picture of DNA that is emerging shows it does in fact store vast quantities of information, much of which was missed by the first scientists to study it. Much more is probably yet to be discovered. Conclusions There is beauty, complexity, elegance and efficiency in the choice of DNA as the medium for storing genetic information, and the information itself is amazing. Some of what we know about genomes fits well with the thesis of common ancestry and Darwinian evolution, but when taken as a whole, the evidence is more consistent with the Biblical worldview in which a Designer, God, accounts for the choice of DNA as the genetic material, the enormous quantities of information stored in it and the elegant arrangement of that information in genomes. When the Creator God wrote the 10 Commandments,[16] He did so in the durable medium of stone; but when He wrote the sins of the self-righteous scribes and Pharisees, He wrote in dust, where His words would be quickly obliterated.[17] The God of the Bible demonstrated His ability to choose appropriate media in which to record information, it should not be surprising to find that in living things He chose a medium as well suited to the task of recording genetic information as DNA, or that the information stored in DNA is elegant and amazing. Every person, every creature, every plant–indeed every living organism–is an exquisite repository of genetic information encoded in DNA, information far more exquisite and deeply meaningful than anything written by William Shakespeare or any other human author. Christians have good reason to believe that we are “fearfully and wonderfully made”[18] and that God, who created us along with all other things, is worthy of our worship.', 'If given the choice where in our Milky Way galaxy you would prefer to live, where would you go? To one of those newly-discovered extra-solar planets the media get enthusiastic about when water has been detected there? Before you answer these questions remember that, beyond the presence of water, many other conditions must be fulfilled before any planet can support the continued existence of life as-we-know-it, human life.Over the last 40 years or so, astronomical studies have taught us that our life on Earth is dependent on a number of physical and other conditions far beyond just the presence of water. The majority of almost two hundred conditions refer to the necessary characteristics of our planet itself (temperature, chemical composition, stability, etc.) as well as to the properties of, and our location in, our Milky Way galaxy (are there nearby planets, sources of harmful radiation, etc.?). These conditions include the following Life on Earth requires a “just right” distance from our reliable source of energy, the sun. Earth’s chemical composition must contain those chemicals that are the main building blocks of human life oxygen to breath, calcium to build skeletons, carbon to build carbohydrates and, together with hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus, to make DNA. Earth needs a reasonably stable climate to allow food production to proceed along largely predictable lines; our Moon provides that stability for Earth’s rotation axis and its seasons. Our planet must not be too close to the centre of the Milky Way where deadly high-energy radiation would destroy life.In fact, even the universe as a whole plays an important role in the habitability of our planet. This includes the almost perfect electrical balance between positively and negatively charged particles to ensure that the universe does not expand too fast for stars and planets to form. The word “perfect” in this sentence means an accuracy of 1 in 1037 [this is a 1 followed by 37 zeroes!]. A similar balance governs the mass density of the universe which should not vary by more than 1 in 1060; too high and the universe would have collapsed long ago, too low and the universe would expand too fast for galaxies, stars and planets to form. No wonder we talk about these specific conditions as ‘fine-tuning’! The large number of requirements and their often narrow limits outside of which life could not exist already tell us that it may be difficult to find all of them fulfilled at a large number of different locations in the Milky Way. Add to this the fact that what we know about any extrasolar planets is still very rudimentary, and our search becomes like the one for a needle in a haystack. Since Earth offers a successful habitat for many life forms, in a first approach we should focus on Earth-size planets in extrasolar planetary systems the distance from their star, the presence of water, the nature of its atmosphere, etc. For each host star these conditions are only fulfilled in a fairly narrow zone around it inside of which the planet must be revolving. This zone is called the Circumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ) of that star. It will be farther from a hotter star and closer to a cooler star (Fig. 1).Thus, our search for suitable planets must first focus on finding suitable host stars, preferable a little less massive than the sun. Such stars are known as red dwarf stars, which constitute the overwhelming majority of stars in the Milky Way. The next step is to find small, i.e., Earth-size planets that are most likely to be rocky and have a suitable atmosphere. However, small planets are much harder to detect than their giant gaseous neighbours. The temperature of the star and its planet’s distance from it tell us whether we can expect to find liquid water. In a few cases the planet’s atmospheric composition can be derived. Surely, before moving to any exoplanet, we want to know many more details that are not easily obtained. Therefore, even the simple question about the number of possible exoplanets fit for human life will probably not be answered today or tomorrow. Because of the number of conditions to occur simultaneously, we do not expect to find many habitable exoplanets. The universe may turn out to be a rather inhospitable place for human life. Earth, if not unique, could well be one of a very small number of favourable planets. Considering the huge amount of fine-tuning required for a liveable planet, we should contemplate the possibility that the Creator of the universe has had a special purpose for creating Earth and its inhabitants, and that Earth’s uniqueness is a result of design rather than of accident.']\n",

Smetime calle the  mathematic f change, it i the branch f mathematic that eal with the precie way in which change in ne variable relate t change in anther.  In ur aily activitie we encunter tw type f variable:  the that we can cntrl irectly an the that we cannt.  Frtunately, the variable that we cannt cntrl irectly ften repn in me way t the we can.  Fr example, the acceleratin f a car repn t the way in which we cntrl the flw f galine t the engine; the inflatin rate f an ecnmy repn t the way in which the natinal gvernment cntrl the mney upply; an the level f antibitic in a pern bltream repn t the age an timing f a ctr precriptin.  By unertaning quantitatively hw the variable, which we cannt cntrl irectly, repn t the that we can, we can hpe t make preictin abut the behavir f ur envirnment an gain me matery ver it.  Calculu i ne f the funamental mathematical tl ue fr thi purpe. Calculu wa invente t anwer quetin that cul nt be lve by uing algebra r gemetry.    One branch f calculu, calle Differential calculu, begin with a quetin abut the pee f mving bject.  Fr example, hw fat e a tne fall tw ecn after it ha been rppe frm a cliff?   The ther branch f calculu, Integral calculu, wa invente t anwer a very ifferent kin f quetin:  what i the area f a hape with curve ie?  Althugh thee branche began by lving ifferent prblem, their meth are the ame, ince they eal with the rate f change. Sme anticipatin f calculu can be een in Eucli an ther claical writer, but mt f the iea appeare firt in the eventeenth century.  Sir Iaac Newtn (1642 – 1727) an ttfrie W. Leibniz (1646 – 1716) inepenently icvere the funamental therem f calculu.  After it tart in the eventeenth century, calculu went fr ver a century withut a prper aximatic funatin.  Newtn wrte that calculu cul be rigruly fune n the iea f limit, but he never preente hi iea in etail.  A limit, rughly peaking, i the value apprache by a functin near a given pint.  During the eighteenth century many mathematician bae their wrk n limit, but their efinitin f limit wa nt clear.  In 1784, Jeph Lui Lagrange (1736-1813) at the Berlin Acaemy prpe a prize fr a ucceful aximatic funatin fr calculu.  He an ther were interete in being a certain f the internal cnitency f calculu a they were abut algebra an gemetry.  N ne wa able t uccefully repn t the challenge.    It remaine fr Augutin Lui Cauchy (1789-1857) t hw, metime arun 1820, that the limit can be efine rigruly by mean f inequalitie (Hughe-Hallett, 1998, 78). Purpe f the tuy Calculu i ne f the ubject being taught fr higher mathematic in high chl an cllege.  The purpe f thi paper i t hw hw t ue calculu in ur relatinhip with .

An thugh, thrugh the age, humankin ha experimente t be able t raw cncluin in the area f mathematic,  law are errr-free an cntant.

Withut me cntancy, we wul never be able t plan, r hpe, r knw what t expect.   law, bth the mral law an the law f nature, are a cntant a He i.  S we can expect that tmrrw the un will rie in the eat, a it ha ne every ay in the pat. A given value (cntant) help in lving a given functin.  Fr example, it i etimate that x mnth frm nw, the ppulatin f a certain cmmunity will be  (functin).  At what rate will the ppulatin be changing with repect t time 15 mnth (cntant) frm nw?  Slutin:  the rate f change f the ppulatin with repect t time i the erivative f the ppulatin functin. The rate f change f the ppulatin 15 mnth frm nw will be peple per mnth.  , wh we ai i cntant, i a preent help in time f truble(Palm 46:1).   Inee, withut  in ne life, we will never fin atifactry lutin t prblem. In calculu, if we vilate the law we will never fin the right lutin t the given prblem r functin.  When we vilate the law f  ur life becme chatic an we will never fin peace r the right lutin t ur prblem. Limit an Limitle  The cncept f limit i very imprtant in calculu.  Withut limit calculu imply e nt exit.  Every ingle ntin f calculu i a limit in ne ene r anther.   On the cntrary  ha n limit.   When we apply the cncept f limit, we examine what happen t the y-value f a functin f(x) a x get cler an cler t (but e nt reach) me particular number, calle a.  If the y-value al get cler an cler t a ingle number, L, then the number L i ai t be the limit f the functin a x apprache a.  Thu, we ay that L i the limit f f(x) a x apprache a.  Thi i written in mathematical hrthan a where the ymbl → tan fr the wr apprache. If the y-value f the functin  nt get cler an cler t a ingle number a x get cler an cler t a, then the functin ha n limit a x apprache a.  Figure 1 hw the graph f a functin that ha a limit L a x apprache a particular a. Limit remin u f the experience f the Iraelite, a they travele thrugh the wilerne.  Mt f the ault Iraelite wh came ut frm Egypt i nt enter the Prmie Lan except fr Caleb an Jhua.  The chilren f Irael apprache the Prmie Lan; generally peaking, all f them reache the brer.  But nne f them wul have mae it were it nt fr  limitle lve an grace.   Even thugh they ibeye Him  many time,  till kept Hi cvenant with the Iraelite. An thu, the limitle lve f  i emntrate in many ther way:  in the parable f the lt heep, the parable f the prigal n, an even in the way  eal with Hi peple tay.  Jeremiah 31: 3 (NIV) ay:  I have lve yu with an everlating lve.  2 Chrnicle 16: 34 (NIV) ay:  Hi lve enure frever. Let efine cntinuity.  The iea f cntinuity rule ut break, jump, r hle by emaning that the behavir f the functin near a pint be cnitent with it behavir at the pint. Definitin:  The functin f i ai t be cntinuu frm a if an nly if the fllwing three cnitin are atifie: If ne r mre f thee three cnitin fail t hl at a, the functin i ai t be icntinuu at a. Illutratin:  A whlealer wh ell a pruct by the kilgram (r fractin f a kilgram) charge $2 per kilgram if 10 kg r le i rere.  If mre than 10 kg i rere, the whlealer charge $20 plu $1.40 fr each kilgram in exce f 10 kg.  Therefre, if x kilgram f the pruct i  purchae at a ttal ct f  llar, then  an that i, If any f the abve efinitin e nt exit, the functin i ai t be icntinuu.  One f the example hwing that hi faith in  wa preent wa Me when he le the Iraelite ut in the eert.  Me an the peple were in the eert, but what wa he ging t  with them?  They ha t be fe an fee wa what he i. Me neee t have arun 1500 tn f f each ay.  T bring that much f each ay, tw freight train, each arun a kilmeter lng wul be neee.  We all knw they were ut in the eert,  they wul nee firew t ck the f.  Thi wul take 4000 tn f w an a few mre freight train, each a kilmeter lng, jut fr ne ay.  An they were frty year in the eert.

Then anther thing:  they ha t cr the Re Sea.  Nw, if they went n a narrw path, uble file, the line wul be arun 1200 km lng an wul take 35 ay an night t get thrugh.  S, there ha t be pace in the Re Sea, arun 5 km wie  that they cul walk 500 abreat t get ver in ne night. But then, there wa anther prblem.  Each time they campe at the en f the ay, they neee a big pace, a ttal f arun 2000 quare kilmeter lng. D yu think Me at wn t figure all thi ut befre he left Egypt?

Accring t Palm 32: 10, The Lr unfailing lve urrun the man wh trut in Him. reat i ur Lr an mighty in pwer; hi unertaning ha n limit.  P. 147:5(NIV) Derivative an Unchanging  Derivative i a mathematical tl that i ue t tuy rate at which phyical quantitie change.  It i ne f the tw central cncept f calculu, an it ha a variety f applicatin, incluing curve ketching, the ptimizatin f functin, an the analyi f rate f change. A typical prblem t which calculu can be applie i prfit ptimizatin.  Fr example: a manufacturer mnthly prfit frm the ale f rai wa P(x) = 400(15 – x)(x – 2) llar when the rai were l fr x llar a piece.  The graph f thi prfit functin, which i hwn in Figure 2, ugget that there i an ptimal elling price x at which the manufacturer prfit will be greatet.  In gemetric term, the ptimal price i the x crinate f the peak f the graph. In thi example, the peak can be characterize in term f line that are tangent t the graph.  In particular, the peak i the nly pint n the graph at which the tangent line i hrizntal, that i, at which the lpe i zer. T the left f the peak, the lpe f the tangent i pitive.  T the right f the peak the lpe i negative. Calculu i al ne f the technique ue t fin the rate f change functin.   The rate f change f a linear functin with repect t it inepenent variable i equal t the teepne r lpe f it traight-line graph.  Beie, thi teepne r rate f change i cntant. We can lve ptimizatin prblem an cmpute rate f change if we have a prceure fr fining the lpe f the tangent t a curve at a given pint. We begin with a functin f, an n it graph we che a pint (x, f(x)).  Refer t Figure 3.    We che a mall number h ≠ 0 an n the graph mark the pint (x + h, f(x + h)).  Nw we raw the ecant line that pae thrugh thee tw pint.  The ituatin i picture in Figure 4, firt with h > 0 an then with h < 0. A h ten t zer frm the right (Figure 4), the ecant line ten t the limiting pitin inicate by the ahe line, an ten t the ame limiting pitin a h ten t zer frm the left.  The line at thi limiting pitin i what we call  the tangent t the graph at the pint (x, f(x)). Since the apprximating ecant line have lpe, we can expect the tangent line, the limiting pitin f thee ecant, t have lpe, While (*) meaure the teepne f the line that pae thrugh the pint (x. f(x)) an (x +h, f(x +h)), (**) meaure the teepne f the graph at (x, f(x)) an i calle the lpe f the graph. We can nw efine ifferentiatin. A functin f i ai t be ifferentiable at x if an nly ifSince the erivative f the cntant i zer an we knw that  lve i cntant an it e nt change,  the rate f change f  lve i zer.  1 Jhn 4:16(NIV) ay:   i lve.

Thi may well be anther example f the crucial imprtance f the chice f paraigm we apt fr ur interpretative exercie. After the hectic event f the firt few ecn ince the beginning f the expanin f the Univere, the imple atm f hyrgen an helium were frme in the firt three minute. By then the initial, high temperature ha rppe  far that n further chemical element cul be yntheie. After 300,000 year the Univere became tranparent an matter began t minate the prceeing. alaxie frme an in them tar. Here, in my pinin, we fin the mre reliable chapter f the Big Bang try.

The bet mel f what happene earlier eem t explain the Univere a we knw it tay. Hwever, ince they cannt be verifie bervatinally, they remain in the area f peculative mel builing.  The greatet ifficulty with the purely cientific mel lie in the fact that  cience can be ne nly in -calle cle ytem; i.e. ytem which are nt influence by anything utie the pace an time wherein they perate. Hw, thugh, can the aumptin that the Univere i a cle ytem be verifie?

In that cae, the Univere mut have been eternal: there never wa a time when there wa n univere.

Befre we turn t the Bible, hwever, we nee t lk at an apect f the Univere that eem quite capable f upprting a mre biblical apprach t anwering the quetin the Univere pe. Interetingly, the evience in favur f the exitence an activity f a g with a pernal interet in the living being in the Univere cme frm cience itelf. 2.2. Cmic CincienceCnier the rigin an evlutin f human life. Science cul ecribe human being a me kin f bichemical rganim. Hwever, befre ne can talk abut the way life perate, i.e. abut bichemitry, it i neceary t explain where the mlecule invlve in life came frm. Befre ne can icu the rigin f  cmplex rganic mlecule, ne mut explain the rigin f atm. Finally, it i neceary t icu the rigin f the chemical element an the phyic that mae them pible. Thi, t, i ne f the pitive apect f the Big Bang thery f the rigin f the Univere. It tart with particle an nuclear phyic, then prcee via inrganic an rganic chemitry t bichemitry an life. In hi bk “The Creatr an the Cm, Hugh R lit thirty-five cae f phyical quantitie that nee t aume value within certain very narrw range fr life t be pible (15). Here I hall give nly a few example.1.     Fr life t fin a habitat, it i neceary that there be enugh energy t maintain life. Planet that harbur life receive their energy frm the tar they revlve abut – the Sun in ur cae. Star, a ur Sun, are knwn t frm in galaxie. Thu, in the purely cientific view, galaxie, tar an planet mut exit fr life t be able t be maintaine. Furthermre, a planet can nly be habitable if it itance frm it energy-prviing tar – it  un’ – fall within certain fairly narrw limit.2.     Organic mlecule are cntructe ut f a cllectin f mre than frty ifferent chemical element. Their bning epen n tw phyical factr: the trength f the frce f electrmagnetim an the rati f the mae f the electrn an the prtn. Fr intance, if the electrmagnetic frce i t trng, atm will nt hare their electrn with ther atm, an mlecule cannt frm. If, n the ther han, the electrmagnetic frce were t weak, atm wul nt be able t hang n t their electrn an wul, again, have nne t hare fr mlecule frmatin.3.     Organic mlecule nee t be available in ufficient quantitie an varietie. Thi require a range f ifferent atm t frm firt. Fr thi t happen, the trng an weak nuclear frce f phyic, the frce f gravity, an the nuclear grun-tate energy mut all be preciely balance. Epecially imprtant are ufficient quantitie f carbn an xygen which are eential fr life. E.g., in thi cae the trng nuclear frce nee t have a value within 0.5% f it preent-ay value.4.     Atm are mae frm nuclen – prtn an neutrn – whe quantitie mut al fall within narrw limit. Since neutrn are lightly mre maive than prtn, the Big Bang frm larger number f the latter. If the neutrn were jut 0.1% mre maive, nt enugh f them wul frm t pruce the neceary atm. If the neutrn were 0.1% le maive,  many wul be frme that all tar in the Univere wul have cllape int neutrn tar an black hle lng ag.5.     Unle the number f electrn i equal t the number f prtn t an accuracy f ne part in 1037, electrmagnetic frce wul have vercme gravitatinal frce t the extent that galaxie, tar an planet cul never have frme. 6.     Fr galaxie an tar t frm, the Univere mut nt expan t rapily – fr that wul tear tar apart befre they are frme – nr t lwly – fr that wul caue the cllape f the Univere lng befre tar have ha time t pruce the mre maive chemical element. Therefre, the cmic expanin nee t be fine-tune t the tune f ne in 1060! The number an the preciin f the fine-tuning f the variu phyical an cmic parameter are  increible that ne mut cnier the pibility that ur Univere e nt harbur life – at leat n Earth – by pure cincience. It eem a if there i a purpe t thi Univere: it wa mae with the expre purpe f being able t upprt human life. Thi, then, i g evience fr the exitence, nt nly f eign, but al f a Deigner.

The Biblical MelThe Bible i a bk f revelatin. Thrugh Hi Hly Spirit  inpire peple chen by Him t write part f thi bk. The Bible i pen t invetigatin by whever want t learn frm it. The nature f it rigin, hwever, require that it tuent nee t allw the ame Hly Spirit t guie them in frming their cncluin. It i mtly abut , epecially hw He cpe with the prblem f in an hw t retre fallen mankin t it frmer glry.  In the Bible, the baic, inpire accunt f the rigin f the Univere i fun in it firt chapter. In fact, the very firt vere f the Bible anwer fur f the five baic quetin f when, wh, hw, what, an why.  When?’ i anwere with  In the beginning’.  Wh?’ i anwere with  ’.  Hw?’ i anwere by  create’.

What wa the nature f the light n Day 1 befre the Sun wa create, apparently n Day 4?  In what fllw, I hall try t eal with thee quetin ne by ne a far a thi i pible. After that, I hall give an verall ynthei. 1.     enei 1: 1, 2.Richar Davin ha argue n literal, linguitic, tylitic, thelgical, an ther grun that vere 1 an 2 f enei 1 cannt be cniere an intructry ummary t the ret f the chapter, nr the accunt f an initial creatin that wa etrye a a reult f in (17). He efen the view that the firt tw vere ecribe the initial creatin, by , f matter befre Day 1 f creatin week, an that the tate f that earlier creatin wa ne f thu an bhu.  Thi i the traitinal view f the majrity f Chritian an Jewih interpreter, al calle the  initial unfrme-unfille’ view. I accept thi view a the ne that ha greatet prmie f unertaning the Bible’ accunt f the rigin f the Univere.In thi view, the firt tw vere f enei 1 are t be eparate frm the ret f the chapter becaue they ecribe what happene at an earlier,  in-the-beginning’, epch r era. I cnier thi an eential element in ur unertaning f the rigin f all thing, an an inipenable ingreient fr the harmniatin between the cientific an biblical view.The accunt f the rigin f the wrl a we knw it n ur planet i then given in enei 1:3-31, the accunt f the Creatin Week. 2. What wa create uring the Creatin Week?Accring t the traitinal view,  alway exite – He i frm eternity – an Hi creative wrk began at a etermine mment in time. Thi  in the beginning’ i me – maybe cnierable – time befre the tart f Creatin Week . There i, therefre, time fr the creatin f matter in whatever frm befre Day 1 f vere 3. In fact, there may be ample time fr the creatin f a variety f thing.  Can we etermine what wa create befre Day 1 an what after?In hi bk The Age f the Univere: What are the Biblical limit?

Then, at me time uring the furth ay, the eparatin between ay an night (v. 14) brught abut by the Sun, Mn an tar, i eliminate – but nte that there i till me (ther) mechanim fr making that eparatin becaue ay an night were initially eparate n Day 1. On the thir ay, all vegetatin i remve, an the eparatin between lan an ea i eliminate by ubmerging the lan uner the water. At the beginning f the thir ay, the earth i vi f all life, human, animal an plant, an i cvere with water. Then, ging back thrugh Day 2, the expane that eparate the water uner it frm the water abve it i remve. One aume that the water frm abve fall wn an that the lan i nw eeply ubmerge. Finally n Day 1 the eparatin between ay an night i n lnger there when the light ge ut.  What  we fin n the eve f the firt ay?

Planet Earth i till there, but it i cmpletely unrecgniable. There i n lnger any life. It i a ark place cvere uner a glbal ea. Thi i exactly the ecriptin we fin in vere 2: “Nw the earth wa frmle an empty, arkne wa ver the urface f the eep,  . The ame thught i expree by  himelf when He talk t Jb abut Hi creatin. In Jb 38: 8-9 we fin a ecriptin f the Earth that eem t ugget there wa nly water, an that the water wa cvere by heavy clu that wrappe it in eep arkne. It eem a if thi unfrme an unfille Earth ha been create befre Day 1, an that the very hrt accunt f that creatin an the cnitin in which it wa then left, are given in vere 1 an 2. 3.     What wa the time frame f creatin, an when wa  in the beginning’?A far a the creative wrk f the ix ay i cncerne, I believe that that wa accmplihe in ix literal 24-hur ay. Other have prvie ample evience that the way the Hebrew language number the ay in enei 1, can nly be unert a enting peri f 24 hur (19). What abut the time frame preceing Creatin Week, the time between  in the beginning’ an Day 1? Apart frm the interpretatin that vere 1 an 2 refer t mething that happene befre Day 1, there i n inicatin hw far back ne ha t g t arrive at  the beginning’. Hwever, thi i an area where cience ha much t ay.  Lking back in time t the faintet galaxie at the larget itance frm Earth, we are lking back in time ver me 13.5 billin year. The Univere mut be at leat that l. In cientific term, 13.5 billin year BP wul be the latet pible epch f  in the beginning’.  Can we al ay mething abut the earliet pible ate fr the  beginning’? Frm there n back t the beginning f the cmic expanin i a matter f nly 300,000 year. T what extent the beginning f the expanin f the Univere cincie with  the beginning’ f enei 1, i ifficult t ay. Accring t cience, it i a matter f anther fractin f a ecn. There may be n bai fr anwering thi quetin until the Creatr will have tl u when an hw He i it. 4.What wa the nature f the light n Day 1?Thi quetin cncern the creatin f the Sun, Mn an tar n Day 4. There are everal pibilitie fr relving the apparent prblem.a.      The Sun, Mn an tar were create n Day 4 a the text eem t imply. During the firt three ay the light wa prvie by  whe preence mean light becaue He i  the light f the wrl’ (20).b.     The Sun, Mn an tar were create tgether with the ther bject in the Univere,  in the beginning’. The arkne mentine in vere 2 wa caue by a thick clu cver a uggete in Jb 38:9. Then, n Day 1, the ark clu were lifte ufficiently t allw the ifference between night an ay t be perceive – much like a cmpletely vercat ky tay – while the Sun, Mn an tar themelve remaine inviible. Then, n Day 4, the clu were lifte further an thee luminarie cul be een by an berver n the urface f the Earth. Nte the fllwing intereting etail:i)                   The emphai n Day 4 i n the functin f eparating the ay frm the night. Wherea n the firt three ay thi functin wa fulfille either by  (a. abve) r by a yet inviible luminarie (b.), nw thi functin i clearly given t the Sun, Mn an tar.  Separatin’ i a functin we fin n every ne f the firt fur ay. Day 1: light frm ark, ay frm night; Day 2: water abve frm water belw; Day 3: lan frm ea; Day 4: ay frm night by viible functinarie.ii)                 The Hebrew cntructin in vere 16, “  the leer light t gvern the night. He al mae the tar, can al be tranlate, “  the leer light t gvern the night tgether with the tar. Thi reaing wul eliminate the argument fr believing that the tar were mae n the furth ay. There i ne further bervatin I want t make. enei 1 ue tw ifferent Hebrew wr fr the manufacture f thing an creature. The verb bara i ue when  create withut recure t pre-exiting matter, mething nly He can . Therefre, in mt Bible verin, bara i tranlate  create’.

On the firt fur ay, mt f the wrk wa in act f eparatin: ay frm night, water abve frm water belw, an lan frm ea.

After frming the fih an the bir,  a a new element t thee creature, mething that wa nt alreay preent: life (21). The final ue f bara i fun in vere 26 an 27. In the firt intance, in v.26,  ay, “Let u make (aah) man in ur image  .. a if thi new creature i ging t have the ame life a the animal. But, then, in v.27, when He i actually creating man, the wr bara i ue three time. Nw  a mething t the life f man that the animal  nt pe: Hi image. An He ue the wr bara three time t inicate that man i given the image f each f the three pern f the hea, Father, Sn an Hly Spirit.

At that time it became tranparent an the raiatin-minate era wa replace by the matter-minate era in which we live tay. After the firt 300,000 year, galaxie began t frm an, in the galaxie, tar. In the Univere, it eem  ha a pecial rle fr the tar t play. They were the cking pt where He prepare mt f the chemical element He later ue in the frmatin f the Earth.

Thi i aerte t be the cae bth fr the circumtance f genuine freem in the univere, an al fr it manner f being.In the early 1500 the univere an  actin in it were eeme by the church t be well unert. At the center f the univere wa the immvable earth, create by  fr mankin, the pinnacle f Hi creatin.  Arun the earth mve the crytalline phere carrying the even heavenly bie, utie f which wa the eight phere cntaining the fixe tar.  Encling thi wa the phere f the prime mver where wa enthrne the triune , t whm re the muic f the phere a the celetial bie mve.[1]Natural an cial agencie meiate Divine apprval an cenure in a very irect ene.  There wa n ubt abut  actin in the affair f men a He tre thrugh the length an breath f the earth.  Hi cle invlvement in rain an hine, ne pernal frtune, an tne neighbr untimely eath, wa imply aume.  King rule by ivine right an the plague f Eurpe were een a  jut jugment n the nxiu in f mankin.  Even where it wa ntice, eep rer an ytem in nature remaine largely unremarke.  In the time there wa n nee t enquire a t hw  wrke in thi wrl.  He jut i. An miracle were nt, after all,  very much ifferent in ubtance t  ther wrk.  All were equally inexplicable.  In the abence f what we nw knw a law f nature the faithful were pare any cnjecture a t hw  gt arun them! Similarly, the fact that human cul genuinely etermine utcme wa imply aume.Then, uring 1543, Nichla Cpernicu publihe De Revlutinibu Orbium Celetium in which he argue fr a helicentric rather than a gecentric univere, an the tage wa et fr a majr upheaval f nt nly ur knwlege f the natural realm, but much f Chritian thught a well.  The challenge t rthxy wa further fcue a alile telecpe ubequently reveale the mn f Jupiter, pt n the un, an irregularitie f the lunar urface.  Thma Kuhn ecribe thi challenge graphically.[2] Due t the trng chlatic nexu between mtin an perfectin; a circular mtin fr the earth uggete t the church father a tate f terretrial perfectin.  Thi, hwever, wa thelgically abur.  Cnverely, the lar an lunar irregularitie uggete imperfectin in the heaven, which wa jut a unacceptable.  It all tene t remve the Arittelian iviin between celetial permanence an perfectin an ublunar ephemera an ecay, which ha been  cmpletely ubume int the church by Aquina.  Later icverie uggeting an evlving univere further challenge traitinal unertaning f a cmplete an aethetically perfect creatin.It i ifficult t ee hw thi cnfuin reulte in a grwing uncertainty ver the extent f  actin within the univere, threatening the exiting tructure f caual unertaning.  Quetin are cncerning jut what it wa that  ha finihe, an what it wa that he wa till irecting.  Jhn Dnne later lamente thi ilutin f the l rer in hi An Anatmie f the Wrl.The new philphy call all in ubt,The element f fire i quite put ut;The un i lt, an th earth, an n man witCan well irect him where t lk fr it.An freely men cnfe that thi wrl pent,When in the Planet, an the FirmamentThey eek  many new; then ee that thiI crumble ut again t hi Atmie.Ti all in piece, all cherence gne;All jut upply, an all Relatin:Prince, Subject, Father, Sn, are thing frgt,Fr every man alne think he hath gtT be a Phenix, an that then can beNne f that kin, f which he i, but he.[3] A it happene, the argument f the cientit ha little appeal t mt eccleiatic wh, even when they unert them, were unwilling t achieve minr celetial harmnie at the expene f majr terretrial an thelgical icr.[4]n(Har they better unert the lng term effect f thi new thught, they may have been till le impree). Oppitin t the new cmlgy wa quickly expree by leaing Cathlic thelgian, with the alile affair further harening reitance.[5] Statement by cntemprary Prtetant leaeruch a Luther, Melanchthn, an Calvin, al trngly pping the new thught, are well cumente.[6]We knw that the ubequent attempt f the Church t eal with helicentrim nt nly influence thelgy but hape the religiu experience f the cmmn man. A tate by Kuhn, uring the century an a half fllwing alile eath in 1642, a belief in the earth centere univere wa graually tranfrme frm an eential ign f anity t an inex, firt, f inflexible cnervatim, then f exceive parchialim, an finally f cmplete fanaticim.[7] Hwever, the apparent relutin f the cientific cnflict i nt remve the cnfuin ver  actin within creatin intruce by the Cpernican challenge.Definite preure againt traitinal Chritian unertaning f prvience, a well a quetin cncerning jut hw human cauality hul be unert, arrive with the evelpment f cientific reuctinim an eterminim. Frm the time f alile an Newtn it wa perceive that many natural ytem cul be bet qualifie an quantifie by ucceively breaking them wn int their cntituent ub-ytem. Once the builing blck were unert, they cul then be yntheize again. The ucce f thi technique when it wa applie in phyic, chemitry, atrnmy an meicine wa impreive. The realizatin, fr example, that the by cnite f ytem, uch a the circulatin ytem, which were in turn cmprie f rgan, gave birth t mern meical cience. Becaue f it intrpectin, reuctinim tene t iminih any apect f reality uch a pernality an free will, which cul nt be cnveniently reuce, t a pitin f relative unimprtant.Furthermre, the univere, which ha been een a the playgrun f capriciu r lving eitie wa nw, it eeme, bet unert a ne f utaine rer, thi rer being bet expree by mathematical law. Thi regularity an preictability wa een t be ubiquitu.  One f the great cientit f thi peri, the Marqui e Laplace tate that if ne cul knw the pitin an velcity f all the particle in the univere then it wul nt nly be pible t ttally preict the future, but al t retrfit the part.[8] Thi i cientific eterminim.Chritian initially ha truble with thi ntin ince it eeme t remve any rm fr genuine vlitin, either human r Divine. Inee it wa urge againt Newtn that by hi tatement f the law f gravitatin he tk frm  that irect actin n hi wrk  cntantly acribe t Him in Scripture an tranferre it t material mechanim; al that he ubtitute gravitatin fr prvience.[9] Over the fllwing tw hunre year, hwever, the Church ajute t thi iea an came, by the time f the great aplgit uch a Archeacn Paley, t ee in the vat an acceible rer f nature the very trnget argument fr a Divine Deigner.[10]There wa a real tenin, hwever, between thi  f rer, an the One f incrutability. If nature i  preictable thrugh being preetermine, then what f human vlitin, t ay nthing f  prvience? It eeme t many that the nly  lgically cnitent with thi view f phyical reality wa the  f Deim. The univere may well have been wun up, but it ha efinitely been well an truly let g!Chritian eeme recncile t a caling wn f prvience t the extent that wherea in pat centurie they may have praye fr rain an fr ecurity in l age, it became mre likely that they wul turn t irrigatin an uperannuatin intea.  A a reult f thi type f thinking we have becme  cnvince in mern time f the univerality f caue an effect that we even apply cientific reuctinit thinking t prblem f the church, uch a evangelim an church grwth.In the prce  ha becme, fr me, a  f the gap, there t  the har bit.

Thee thught tructure were the therie f Relativity an Quantum mechanic. Within the lat fifty year thee have been jine by a thir, that f Chatic Dynamic, mre ppularly knwn a Cha Thery. Accring t Capek[11] the preent tranfrmatin f phyic i far mre cnequential that even the Cpernican Revlutin.  Thi time the iue at take i nt nly the tructure f the lar ytem but the tructure f the univeral crinate a well.  Space, time an cauality are calle int quetin in a manner which threaten mt f what right-thinking peple have previuly regare a unaailable cmmn ene.Special relativity hwe that matter may be turne int energy an energy back int matter, thu intrucing the atmic age.  It al hwe that ne meaurement f time an pace in anther reference frame are epenent n the relative pee f that reference frame.  Simultaneity turn ut t be a relative cncept, nt an ablute ne.  Frm eneral relativity we learn that in the regin f a maive bject pace i curve, an that the three angle f a triangle  nt a up t 180 egree.  We learn that gravity ha a grip n time an that if a clck i taken me itance away frm the earth, fr example, it will run fater than an ientical unit back hme.  Black hle, accumulatin f matter  huge that even light cannt ecape frm them, are ptulate.  Near a Black hle time wul lw wn ramatically.  If it were pible t hver near the ege f uch a black hle, ne clck wul tp cmpletely,[12] an ne wul embark n a jurney t nt nly nwhere, but nwhen!  It wul be impible t return frm uch a jurney ince the univere wul have happene.  Quantum mechanic tell u that n the cale f the very mall, uch a the atmic level, the l law f caue an effect break wn.  Event happen withut caue.  It tranpire that ue t Heienberg uncertainty principle there are phyical limit n what can be imultaneuly meaure within a ytem. One jut cannt knw fr example, the pitin an pee f a particle at the ame time.  The mt efinite tatement that can be mae are the f tatitic. The ilate atm, electrn, r pin i unknwable, an the cncept f the iniviual particle le much f it ignificance.  Matter at time behave like a wave an via vera. Thi i nw a cluy an fitful wrl.  Many cientit, incluing Eintein were very uncmfrtable abut the iea f  playing ice with the univere in thi way but the evience ha been increaingly againt them.Cha thery tell u that uncertainty an intability are nt nly preent at the micrcpic level, but at the macrcpic level a well.  A Plkinghrne ay, even in the everyay there turn ut t be mre clu an le clck.[13] Thi i even mre unexpecte than quantum mechanic bth becaue the reult are mre nticeable, an becaue we ha thught we ha large cale ytem wrke ut.  We learn that the table, linear ytem f claical phyic are the exceptin rather than the rule. We icver that nature cnit largely f nn-equilibrium ytem, an that they are nt a rbut a we ha thught. Thi nn-linearity mean that mall perturbatin may have maive cnequence. If we ubt thi we nee nly try t preict the weather!  In thi cnnectin cientit refer t the butterfly effect whereby a butterfly fluttering it wing in Cranbng, Autralia, affect the weather ver Lnn a mnth later.  Ol claificatin an law have gne a we have learne that ytematic pattern an chatic prcee are nt antithetical at all but rather that there i a ymbitic nexu between them.  Nw we truggle a new t efine cncept uch a rer an prce.Althugh it i mewhat parenthetical t r main argument it i wrth nting, befre we leave relativity, that thi icipline ugget raical reviin t traitinal ntin f initial cauality. If pace, time, matter, an energy are all equally an interrelately the warp an wf f reality, a they eem t be, then what f time befre thi univere? An ince cauality fr u i a tempral cncept, hw i  caue the cm if time i part f it? Relativity eem t ugget that Augutine wa right when he ptulate that  wa utie time a we experience it.[14] There al eem t be me Biblical evience uggeting thi.[15]  Furthermre, ne might ak jut hw  interact with u acr the bunary f pace-time?It i frm quantum mechanic an cha thery, hwever, that the mt intereting peculatin arie. In the cae f quantum mechanic it wa initially aume by many that the in-eterminim encuntere imply repreente an epitemlgical uncertainty.  The utcme f any prce wa really fixe, it i jut that we cant ever fin it ut fr ure. Inee Eintein tk thi tance a the refue t believe that  playe ice. Hwever, it ha been increaingly realize that quantum mechanical uncertainty repreent a genuine ntlgical in-eterminim ie that the uncertainty in knwing repreent a eeper uncertainty f being, in the wr f Jhn Plkinghrne, epitemlgy map ntlgy.[16] Accring t thi view the abence f eterminim at the cntitutinal level f matter repreent a genuine penne t the future, quite in cnflict with claical phyic.In the cae f cha thery, the picture i a little harer t analyze.  Plkinghrne ugget a ueful illutratin, which i well knwn t Phyic 1 tuent. Frm the kinetic thery f gae it i pible t calculate that at rm temperature, each air mlecule will experience apprximately 50 clliin with it neighbr each 10-10. Suppe we wih t etermine jut where a particular mlecule will be, after thee 50 clliin. The lightet micalculatin f the impact parameter f any given clliin will, f cure, mi-que the next impact, which a any billiar player can aert, will have ramatic cnequence wn the track.  In fact it tranpire that if ne fail t take int accunt even mething a inignificant a the gravitatinal attractin f an electrn n the ther ie f the univere, it becme impible t preict the utcme. Due t the ifficulty f the tak thi preictin, therefre, i ut f the quetin.  Thi example emntrate the intrinic unpreictability an unilatability f uch ytem.[17]nThey are unilatable becaue they are  vulnerable t the lightet nuge.  When puhe t it lgical limit, even quantum mechanical interactin aume ignificance fr uch nn-linear ytem.Thi intrinic unpreictability ugget t Plkinghrne that chatic ineterminim i al ntlgical in it rigin. Kellert al incline t thi view, when he write f hi belief that cha thery nt nly argue againt the preictability f certain ytem, but that when cmbine with quantum mechanical cnieratin it lea u t grave ubt abut the ctrine f eterminim itelf.[18] It i being increaingly realize that nt jut the weather, but many natural ytem, are bet ecribe by chatic ynamic.  Accring t thi view the wrl i lene up an liberate frm the Laplacian traightjacket. The natural realm i een a ne f true becming, with a genuine penne t the future which i nt then imply the rearrangement f the pat.It remain pible, f cure, fr inanimate nature t act accring t that regular, if ultimately tatitical, nature enwe at earliet creatin, the invetigatin f which i what we call cience.  It i al pible fr actin f genuine human vlitin, which may be meiate t that natural regularity by mean f the quantum mechanical r chatic ineterminim icue. The cnciu will, in me manner we  nt yet unertan, actually cllape the prbability functin nt ne f it eigenvectr in uch a way a t implement a eciin. Thi apprximate t the view f the phyicit Erwin Schreinger a he reflecte n the circumtance that hi by functine accring t natural law even a it repne t hi cnciu intentin. He cnclue thatThe nly pible inference frm thee tw fact i, I think that I....that i t ay every cnciu min that ha ever ai r felt I - am the pern, if any, wh cntrl the mtin f the atm accring t the law f nature.[19]Or a Franci Jacb put  uccinctly: Bilgy can neither be reuce t phyic nr  withut it.[20] Human freem i thereby een t be genuine, but circumcribe.Having amitte human vlitin an uggete a mechanim, a Chritian we hul perhap nt be altgether urprie if  ha reerve a level f cauality fr Himelf. Thi then, wul be the mechanim f ivine prvience.  Again we wul urmie that  i able t act within creatin n at leat the tw level we have icue an pibly ther f which we are nt aware. Fr all we knw He may be cntinually ing thi, albeit in a mewhat regular \n",
      "                    way.  Ellen White make a number f tatement, which ugget that thi wa her view.[21] It i even pible that there may be element f regularity aciate with  cauality.  Perhap thi i why there i at leat a meaure f imilarity between the experience f ifferent Chritian.We are then le t ptulate a multi-layere cauality acting in nature: a bttm up cauality impe by the inanimate rer, an intermeiate cauality riven by human freem, an a tp wn cauality by which  accmplihe Hi incrutable purpe. Perhap the writer f Prverb 16:9 wa articulating thi iea when he wrte: A man min plan hi way, but he Lr irect hi tep. Such a view f reality may be ue t neatly efine an authentically Chritian natural philphy. The prblem with the naturalitic wrl view enemic t mern chlarhip i imply that while amitting natural law, an in me intance even human vlitin, it enie tp wn cauality.Thi view al ugget a view f miracle.  A miracle cul then be een a g imply ing mething a little ifferent than nrmal, jut an aitinal butterfly here an there. There wul then be nthing upernatural abut it an n natural law i necearily enie.  The itinctin frequently repreente between natural an upernatural i remve altgether, prviing a much greater cherence.  Al, we recgnize that we may never be able t bjectively quantify uch interactin.   actin will generally be hien, never reaily ientangleable frm ther caualitie.  Thi, f cure, e nt mean that g i nt able t reveal Hi actin thrugh the inner eye f faith.  A I rea the Scripture I ee that He ha frequently ne .  Perhap ne f the Bible principal functin i t eclare an uncver  actin in thi way.  The view i upprte by the explratin f rer an chance in Scripture unertaken at a previu faith an learning eminar by eBerg.[22]On the bai f thi unertaning Pkinghrne ugget a mel fr petitinary prayer.  It i nt u uggeting a rather clever plan which might nt have ccurre t . Nr u telling Him mething f which He may nt have been aware.  Rather, petitinary prayer may well be the giving back f ur vlitin t .  Cul thi be the real meaning f the cmmn phrae: Nt my will but Thy Will be ne? (Matt 26:39) Perhap thi i what Paul meant when He wrte: Let thi min be in yu which wa in Chrit Jeu. (Phil 2:5).  In thi ene prayer becme genuinely intrumental an actin becme pible which were nt pible befre.  Nt all thing f cure, but mre thing.  Jut a laer light i pwerful becaue f it cherence ince all the phtn beat in time a it were,  the unin f the human will an the Divine Will place greater vlitin in the han f the Almighty than exit therwie.  Cnequently, it i maximally effective.  Thi may al explain the irectin t engage in crprate prayer, where many peple pray fr the ame thing.  Nt mre fit beating n  r, but greater cherence, an freem in the han f .  A a bering crllary it i al bviu, accring t thi view, that prayer i nt a ubtitute fr actin.[23]Thi mel al ugget a partial relutin f me f the many quetin ariing frm Scripture.  If it i ake, fr example, whether Chrit ie becaue f the betrayal f Jua, becaue f the accumulate weight f human in, r becaue Heaven clck ha jut chime the hur?, the anwer i ye. All f thee element an many mre were invlve in the Chrit event.  Jut hw all the caualitie interplaye we may nt knw n thi earth.  Similarly, we can ee that it may be pible fr prphecy t be bth cnitinal an uncnitinal at the ame time.  Thi may help the thelgian!  Perhap it wa the cngruence f Abraham chice with the Divine will that actually preente  with a wier table f ptin cncerning hi ecenant than wa the cae with any ther racial grup.  Maybe that i why He wa able t che them a an intrument f alvatin fr the wrl.  If , uch a cenari ugget the imprtance f a life rightly aligne.
