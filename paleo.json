The nickname fit the prehistoric beasts unusual features, including 12 rows of short, squat teeth and two long, reptilian spines on its back.  Now, after seven years of research to catalogue its various characteristics, the scientists have determined that the fossil represents a new species. Its official name is Dracopristis hoffmanorum, the museum announced in a statement last week. The first part of its name means dragon shark in Latin, and the latter hoffmanorum is a tribute to the Hoffman family that owns the quarry where the fossil was discovered. Its the biggest shark thats ever been found in New Mexico for that geologic time, says Spencer Lucas, the curator of paleontology at the museum, to Rick Nathanson at the Albuquerque Journal. And certainly the most important fossil shark thats ever been found in New Mexico. Ancient shark specialist John Paul Hodnett, now a program coordinator for the Maryland National Capital Parks and Planning Commissions Dinosaur Park, found the first piece of the dragon shark fossil while sifting through limestone fragments in a quarry in the Manzano Mountains of central New Mexico. The first fragment looked like a piece of a limb bone, which struck Hodnett as unusual because although the region is well known for fossils of plants and animals from the Pennsylvanian period, they are rarely so large. The next day, Hodnett met with Tom Suazo, the museums fossil preparator, who showed him several other fossils that paleontologists had found nearby. The evidence of fin spines suggested it was an ancient shark. Years of additional research and preservation would reveal the find as the most complete shark fossil of its kind. Additional work at the fossils site uncovered an unusual amount of detail about the ancient shark. Excavation turned up the sharks lower jaw with 12 rows of teeth that were first hidden by sediment, which Hodnett found using an angled light technique that reveals lower layers, reports Cedar Attanasio at the Associated Press. Most ancient sharks, including the gigantic megalodon, are only known by fossilized teeth and vertebrae. It is very rare to find skeletal material of ancient sharks, let alone a complete skeleton that also preserved the body outline and other soft tissue impressions, says Hodnett to Harry Baker at LiveScience. That and it being a new species was also amazing and unique. He adds to the Albuquerque Journal, I probably should have played the lottery on that day. The dragon shark falls in a family of sharks called Ctenacanths, which evolved separately from modern sharks about 390 million years ago. The most striking difference between Ctenacanths and modern sharks is the size of their jaws Ctenacanth jaws are larger and less flexible, Hodnett tells LiveScience. During the dragon sharks era, eastern New Mexico was submerged under a seaway. The dragon shark probably would have lived in shallow coastal waters, and the researchers suspect that it hunted crustaceans, fish and smaller sharks. Its short, wide teeth would have been great for grasping and crushing prey rather than piercing prey, says Hodnett to the Associated Press. The shape of its hind fins and tail suggest that the dragon shark lurked near the bottom of ancient lagoons, and the large spines on its back may have protected it from predators. But the researchers are now searching for more fossils of the same species to better understand how it lived. I am also a big fan of the Godzilla film franchise, says Hodnett to Live Science. So when the features of this shark came to light, I thought it was the perfect nickname."}, {"title": "New Study Finds T. Rex Walked at a Slow Pace of Three Miles Per Hour", "author": "Elizabeth Gamillo", "date": "April 23, 2021", "doc": "On the big screen, the Tyrannosaurus rex is often depicted as a predator that could easily catch up to a speeding car with a few swift stomps. Thats probably because paleontologists had suggested that the T. rex clocked a top speed of 30 miles per hour and a walking speed between 4.5 and 6.7 miles per hour, reports Jeff Spry for SYFY Wire. Now, researchers from the Netherlands have used computer reconstructions of a T. rex tail to estimate that the walking speed of the carnivore was much slower. According to the new study published in Royal Society Open Science, the predators walked at just under 3 miles per hour, reports Katie Hunt for CNN. Previous walking estimates of the T. rex were based on research that centered only on the prehistoric reptiles meaty hips and legs, reports Mindy Weisberger for Live Science. However, to find the walking speed of the T. rex, the researchers of the new study focused on the vertical movement of the tyrant lizard kings tail. While calculations on the hips and legs are essential, estimating walking speed only on some parts of the dinosaurs anatomy may give inaccurate results, CNN reports. Dinosaurs overall had unique tails that are not found in any other animals today and may have played a crucial role in the way they walked. When walking, the T. rex would have had its tail suspended in the air. In this position known as passive suspension, the dinosaurs tail would have actively bounced vertically with each step. Dinosaur tails were vital to the way they moved around, in multiple ways, Pasha van Bijlert, a graduate student at the Free University of Amsterdam and first author of the study, tells Live Science. Not only does it serve as a counter balance, the tail also produces a lot of the required force to move the body forward. It does this through two large tail musclesthe caudofemoral musclesthat pull the legs backwards during each step. To calculate how the tail propelled the T. rex, the researchers used an adult T. rex specimen at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden known as Trix. They scanned and modeled Trixs tail bones to find where the ligaments would have been attached and then used a computer model to simulate how these ligaments would have moved while the dinosaur walked, reports Live Science. The paleontologists found that the ligaments stretched to create the vertical bounce and held the dinosaurs suspended tail in a way that did not use up extra energy. The T. rex, they concluded, would walk in a way that matched the speed of its swaying tail, reports Bryan Lawver for Inverse. The tail model gives you a likely step frequencyrhythm for T. rex, but you also need to know how much distance it travels with each step, van Bijlert told Live Science. Researchers combined the tails swaying rhythm with an estimated step length obtained from another T. rex fossils footprints, Inverse reports. They estimated that Trixs step length would have been 6.2 feet and then multiplied that by the step frequency and step length to get a walking speed of 2.86 miles per hour, Live Science reports. Per Inverse, this speed is within the walking speed ranges for other animals and humans. Studying how dinosaurs moved can help paleontologists further understand dinosaur behavior and how they thrived in their prehistoric ecosystems, CNN reports. In future studies, the researchers plan to use this method to calculate the top speed of a T. rex when its sprinting. Other researchers have surmised that the heavy body of a T. rex, weighing between 11,000 to 15,000 pounds, hindered its running speed. However, van Bijlert suspects that the dinosaurs tail may have absorbed the shock in a way that made it able to run faster without breaking any bones, Live Science reports."}, {"title": "New Fossils Suggest Tyrannosaurs May Have Hunted in Packs ", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "April 22, 2021", "doc": "Paleontologists studying a group of four or five tyrannosaurs at a single fossil site in southern Utah say the find suggests the imposing predators may have lived and even hunted in packs, reports Sophia Eppolito for the Associated Press. These fossils, described in a study published this week in the journal PeerJ  Life  Environment, make up the third mass fossil site of tyrannosaurs found in North America, according to a statement. Around 20 years ago, those prior discoveries prompted paleontologists to hypothesize that the extinct carnivores might have been more social than initially imagined. A lot of researchers feel like these animals simply didnt have the brain power to engage in such complex behavior, Alan Titus, a paleontologist with the Bureau of Land Management and lead author of the study, said in an online briefing Monday. But the three mass graves of tyrannosaurs found preserved together are beginning to tell a different story. This must be reflecting some sort of behavior and not just a freak event happening over and over again, said Titus. The newly described fossils were found in 2014 in Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument at a site that paleontologists have nicknamed the Rainbows and Unicorns Quarry because of the splendid array of fossils it has produced. The tyrannosaurs in question are close relatives of Tyrannosaurus rex from the genus Teratophoneus, which comes from the Greek words for monster and murderer, that lived in the Late Cretaceous between 77 and 76.5 million years ago. The size of the bones suggest the group was made up of one adult around 22 years old, one subadult and two or three juveniles that appear to be roughly four years old, reports Cameron Duke for the New Scientist. Per the statement, the adult skeleton measured just shy of 30 feet long. To prove that the dinosaurs died together and werent just thrown together by chance, the team combined the standard physical study of the fossils with chemical analyses using rare earth elements, stable carbon and oxygen isotopes, and charcoal concentrations, reports Juliet Eilperin for the Washington Post. None of the physical evidence conclusively suggested that these organisms came to be fossilized together, so we turned to geochemistry to see if that could help us, says Celina Suarez, a paleontologist at the University of Arkansas and co author of the research, in the statement. The similarity of rare earth element patterns is highly suggestive that these organisms died and were fossilized together. Apparently, the group all drowned in a flood that subsequently washed them into a lake bed. In the statement, tyrannosaur expert Philip Currie, a paleontologist at the University of Alberta who first proposed the notion that these dinosaurs might have been social animals, says the results convincingly argue that the group died together, which adds to a growing body of evidence that tyrannosaurids were capable of interacting as gregarious packs. Speaking with the AP, Kristi Curry Rogers, a biology professor at Macalester College who wasnt involved in the research, says shes not so sure about interpreting the mass grave as a sign of group living or pack hunting under normal circumstances. Its possible that these animals may have lived in the same vicinity as one another without traveling together in a social group, and just came together around dwindling resources as times got tougher, Rogers tells the AP. The public lands that birthed these intriguing fossils are located in one of two national monuments in Utah that former President Donald Trump dramatically reduced, the other being Bears Ears. David Polly, a paleontologist in Indiana University who wasnt involved with the study, tells the Post that the new paper shows the importance of these national monuments for scientific research at a time when the Biden administration is mulling whether to expand Grand Staircase Escalante and Bears Ears to their former size."}, {"title": "100,000-Year-Old Fossilized Footprints Track Neanderthals\u2019 Trip to Spanish Coast", "author": "Isis Davis-Marks", "date": "April 19, 2021", "doc": "Around 100,000 years ago, a group of Neanderthals with children in tow walked along the coast of what is now southern Spain, leaving behind footprints as they padded through the sand. Now, reports Charlie Devereux for the London Times, researchers studying these fossilized footfalls say that some were left by a youngster jumping irregularly as though dancing. Two biologists discovered the prints while strolling along the beach at Matalasca\u00f1as, in Do\u00f1ana National Park, last June. As paleontologists led by Eduardo Mayoral of the University of Huelva write for the Conversation, they investigated the site soon after, finding a large number of fossilized animal tracks presumably made by deer, wild boars, extinct cattle known as aurochs and aquatic birds and at least 87 Neanderthal footprints. The team published its findings in the journal Scientific Reports in March. We have found some areas where several small footprints appeared grouped in a chaotic arrangement, Mayoral tells Tom Metcalfe of Live Science. These prints could indicate an area of passage of very young individuals, as if they were playing or loitering on the shore of the nearby waterlogged area. The researchers used special equipment to scan the prints and determine their size and depthkey indicators of their owners height and age, reports Isaac Schultz for Gizmodo. They concluded that a total of 36 individualsincluding 11 children and 25 adultscreated the markings. Of these 26 adults, 5 were female, 14 were male and 6 were of undetermined sex, according to the study. On average, they stood between 4 and 5 feet tall one outlier appeared to be taller than the rest, but as Gizmodo notes, this individual could have simply been a Neanderthal of a more than standard height who stomped a bit harder than everyone else. Per the paper, the two smallest markings measured just 5.5 inches long. Scholars speculate that a 6 year old child left these petite prints behind. Overall, reports David Miranda for National Geographic Espa\u00f1a, the team estimated the heights of 31 footprints owners Based on this data, 7 of the fossilized marks corresponded with children, while 15 were created by adolescents and 9 by adults. Writing for the Conversation, the authors suggest that the Neanderthals made the impressions while hunting for birds and small carnivores, fishing near a communal watering hole, or searching for shellfish. As the Times notes, they could have also simply been frolicking on the shore. The imprints date back to roughly 106,000 years ago, during the Upper Pleistocene period, when Neanderthals were known to live in the region. Per the London Natural History Museum, these early hominids inhabited Europe between 400,000 and 40,000 years ago. Modern humans arrived on the continent some 46,000 to 44,000 years ago, meaning that the two species could have overlapped for as long as 8,000 years, a landmark pair of studies reported last year. In 2019, researchers in Le Rozel, France, unearthed 257 Neanderthal footprints dated to about 80,000 years ago. The newly discovered Matalasca\u00f1as prints predate these impressions by tens of thousands of yearsa timeline that leads Mayoral and his colleagues to argue that they are the oldest Neanderthal hominid tracks in Europe, and perhaps even the world. Though the scholars uncovered the footprints near a body of water, they emphasize that this doesnt mean Neanderthals were frequent beachgoers. Instead, its more likely that the sandy beach provided a solid foundation for the footprints to fossilize. The fact that Le Rozel and Matalasca\u00f1as sites are located on the coast does not necessarily mean that Neanderthals spent more time in this type of environment, co author J\u00e9r\u00e9my Duveau, a paleoanthropologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, tells Gizmodo. We must keep in mind that Neanderthals were hunter gatherers who moved regularly to acquire resources."}, {"title": "A Prehistoric Flying Creature Nicknamed \u2018Monkeydactyl\u2019 May Have Climbed Trees Using Opposable Thumbs", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "April 16, 2021", "doc": "Researchers have bestowed a newly described species of Jurassic flying reptile with the nickname Monkeydactyl because it has opposable thumbs, reports Maria Temming for Science News. Paleontologists discovered the 160 million year old fossilized pterosaur in an ancient forest called Tiaojishan near modern Liaoning, China. The creatures scientific name is Kunpengopterus antipollicatus and it may be the earliest animal known to possess what appears to be an opposable thumb. The authors of the new research, published earlier this week in the journal Current Biology, suggest this opposable thumb, which could have given the pterosaur the ability to more effectively grasp objects in its environment, may have allowed K. antipollicatus to live in the trees. To better understand the structure and function of the new pterosaurs anatomy, the team scanned the fossil using micro computerized tomography, an imaging technique that uses X rays to create a 3 D image of an object by scanning it slice by slice. Analysis of Monkeydactyls forelimb morphology made researchers think it would have been well suited for climbing, according to a statement. Researchers also examined the question of whether K. antipollicatus was arboreal by studying its skeleton and 25 other pterosaur species alongside more than 150 other species known for tree climbing. The researchers say these comparisons also confirmed the Monkeydactyl moniker was appropriate, showing the animal could have had the right musculature and joint flexibility for climbing. Moreover, several pterosaurs that lived around the same time and location as K. antipollicatus lacked opposable thumbs and dont appear to have been tree climbers. Our results show that K. antipollicatus has occupied a different niche from Darwinopterus and Wukongopterus, which has likely minimized competition among these pterosaurs, says Xuanyu Zhou, a paleontologist at the China University of Geosciences and the studys lead author, in the statement. But Kevin Padian, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved in the research, tells Isaac Schultz of Gizmodo that an opposable thumb is not an infallible indication of arboreality. For example, Padian tells Gizmodo that otters and raccoons have opposable thumbs but arent arboreal. Padian also questions whether the position of K. antipollicatus proposed thumb in the fossil is indicative of the digits orientation in life. The bottom line, for me, is that the specimens articular surfaces are too poorly preserved to draw an inference of opposability, he tells Gizmodo. I think we would want more and better preserved examples of this species before jumping to conclusions."}, {"title": "Unique Bone Structure Helped Long-Necked Pterosaurs Fly ", "author": "Theresa Machemer", "date": "April 16, 2021", "doc": "The azhdarchid group of pterosaurs were some of the largest animals ever to fly. The giant reptiles lived between 66 million and 225 million years ago, and their unusual proportionsbig heads at the end of long, inflexible neckshave long puzzled scientists. Now, research published on Wednesday in the journal iScience offers a detailed look inside of the neck vertebrae of one pterosaur. To achieve the strength necessary to hold up its head and carry prey, while keeping the bone lightweight enough for flight, the vertebra has spokes like a bicycle wheel that connect a center column to the outer surface of the bone. The spokes follow a helical pattern, like a spiral staircase leading through the inside of the bone. We just could not believe it, says University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign paleontologist Cariad Williams, to Rodrigo P\u00e9rez Ortega at Science magazine. We have never seen anything like it before.  It was really impressive. The research focused on one example of pterosaur vertebra that measured 6.2 inches long. While studying the surface of the specimen, the researchers had an unexpected opportunity to use a CT scanner to take measurements. It seemed churlish to turn the offer down, says University of Portsmouth paleontologist David Martill, lead author of the study, in a statement. The CT scan revealed the spokes, which are called trabeculae, inside the bone. Like bicycle wheel spokes, trabeculae that were close together often overlapped. A mathematical model of the vertebrae showed how effective the spokes are at strengthening the bone without adding much weight. An azhdarchid pterosaur has nine vertebrae in its neck, an animal with a four foot long neck would have vertebrae of about 5.5 inches long each. For a vertebra of that size, just 50 spokes would allow the pterosaur to lift 90 percent more weight than if it had no spokes at all. That means it could carry away prey that weighed up to 24 pounds. They were using less energy to optimize their strength in their neck to be able to lift the prey, says Williams to Becky Ferreira at the New York Times. The research begins to answer questions raised by previous research, which suggested that pterosaurs had very little flexibility in their necks, the Williams and Martill write for the Conversation. Modern long necked birds, like herons, usually bend their necks and tuck their heads close to their bodies while they fly. But pterosaurs would have kept their necks outstretched. Therefore, their necks needed to support the weight of the head not only against gravity but also against the strong winds that would hinder their flight. At the same time, their bones became thinner and filled with air sacs to make them lightweight. Those lightweight, thin bones makes it difficult to find well preserved specimens today. The vertebra used in the new study was found at the Kem Kem fossil bed in Morocco. About 100 million years ago, the fossil bed held a river that was home to Cretaceous sharks and carnivorous dinosaurs, alongside pterosaurs. The study offers a nice confirmation of the mechanical structure of azhdarchid vertebrae, says Queen Mary University of London paleontologist David Hone, who was not involved in the study, to the New York Times. But the paper does not address whether the spoke structure is unique to azhdarchids or shared among many pterosaurs. Its a very neat finding that there is this weird arrangement of struts and that this is about the minimum possible to strengthen the bone, says Hone to the Times. But its also not much of a surprise as we know azhdarchids had incredibly reduced bones and were extraordinarily light for their size. Paleontologist Alexander Kellner, the director of the National Museum at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, tells Science magazine, Im not very impressed. I think you should have more specimens to really make a claim. The researchers plan to take more measurements of additional vertebrae when they find more well preserved specimens. Paleontologist and co author Nizar Ibrahim of the University of Portsmouth tells Science magazine the team has several locations in mind to search after the Covid 19 pandemic."}, {"title": "Stones Hint at Possible 600-Mile Dinosaur Migration From Wisconsin to Wyoming", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "April 13, 2021", "doc": "A group of polished, ancient stones found in Wyoming may have been carried more than 600 miles in the huge bellies of plant eating dinosaurs, reports Ashley Piccone for Wyoming Public Radio. The findings, published last month in the journal Terra Nova, could provide a new line of evidence that dinosaurs may have undertaken long overland migrations. Discovered near Wyomings Bighorn Basin in a geologic feature called the Morrison formation, researchers say these smooth, fist sized rocks are gastroliths, which are rocks swallowed by dinosaursand some modern birds and reptilesthat may help grind up fibrous food. A father son geology duo collected the proposed gastroliths in 2017 during field research because the stones shiny appearance looked out of place surrounded by the fine grained mud rock that predominates the Morrison, reports Lucas Joel for the New York Times. We were walking around just doing some fieldwork in the Bighorn Basin, Joshua Malone, a PhD student in geology at the University of Texas at Austin and the studys lead author, tells Wyoming Public Radio. We started seeing these polished stones and we were like, those look pretty exotic compared to all the other rock around us. To figure out where the rocks may have come from the researchers ground them up and examined tiny crystals that resided within them called zircons. The zircon tests suggested the rocks date to the late Jurassic roughly 150 million years ago and that they appear to have originated some 620 miles east. We inferred that these were ingested in Wisconsin, or somewhere along this sluggish stream that was flowing from the east to the western United States during that time, Malone tells Wyoming Public Radio. We figured that once they were ingested, they were carried and eventually deposited out within the Morrison deposition. Speaking with the Times, Malone adds this is the first time gastroliths have been used to infer the movements of dinosaurs. If confirmed, these findings more than double the longest journeys ascribed to the large plant eating sauropods or long necked dinosaurs that may have carried the gastroliths in their stomachs. In 2011, a study of dinosaur teeth suggested the 18 ton Camarasaurus may have migrated nearly 200 miles to find food, reported Ian Sample for the Guardian at the time. However, the current studys hypothesis rests on whether these rocks were indeed gastroliths, a claim made more ambiguous by the fact that the rocks were not found in the context of a fossil skeleton, according to the Times. Unfortunately, we have no real evidence that these clasts are indeed former gastroliths, Oliver Wings, a geologist and vertebrate paleontologist at Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg in Germany who was not involved in the research, tells the Times. We cannot exclude the possibility of transport of the stones in the bellies of dinosaurs, but it remains just one possibility of several. But Wings tells the Times that the technique detailed in the paper for inferring dinosaur movements could still be a significant contribution to paleontology It would be amazing if they could use that method on genuine gastroliths."}, {"title": "These Prehistoric Sharks Had Jaws Shaped Like Circular Saws and Sawtoothed Scissors", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "April 2, 2021", "doc": "Imagine a great white shark with a set of sawtoothed scissors for a mouth. Ridiculous as that image might seem at first, such a creature once swam through Earths seas. More than 300 million years ago, Edestus giganteous bit through its fishy prey with a set of thin, blade like jaws with each serrated tooth set in line right behind the last. Theres nothing quite like this fish alive today, and paleontologists have only recently been able to piece together the relevant clues to understand Edestus and other strange shark relatives from the deep past. The fossils were awaiting technologies capable of revealing the elusive structures of jaws. For more than a century after fish like Edestus were first described, experts could only look at the shape of fossils containing teeth and wonder about what was inside. CT scans and paleo visualization software can now see inside the fossils to capture cartilaginous anatomy that holds clues about what these animals were doing. The resulting research indicates that prehistoric sharks and their relatives bit down in ways that seem alien to scientists now. Shark relatives had buzzsaw arrangements in their lower jaws and jaws that could swing out side to side to impale prey. By understanding how these predators captured prey, scientists can better understand what role they played in ancient ecosystems. In the tree of life, Edestus was a chondrichthyan. Todays sharks, rays and deep sea ratfish all belong to this group, defined by skeletons that are primarily made of flexible cartilage rather than hardened bone tissue. But despite the notion that sharks are living fossils that are little different from their ancestors of 400 million years ago, the fact of the matter is that sharks and their relatives have changed dramatically and entire groups of cartilaginous fish have come and gone through time. Paleontologists have known about strange fossil chondrichthyans from almost the beginning of the discipline. Edestus was originally named from a fragmentary jaw described by naturalist Joseph Leidy in 1856. The teeth resembled those of sharks, but nothing else of the animal was known beyond the jaws. Experts could only guess at what all the missing partsfrom the skull to the tail looked like. The story of Helicoprion is even stranger. In 1886, ichthyologist Henry Woodward named what he thought was a new species of Edestus from a circular whorl of teeth found in Western Australia. But in 1899 Russian geologist Alexander Karpinsky proposed that this fossil was different enough to belong to a new genus of fishHelicoprionthat had an almost trunk like appendage jutting up from its snout that supported the teeth. Other experts disagreed, however, starting more than a century of alternative interpretations. Scientist guessed the teeth of Helicoprion were defensive spines, the vortex like jaws of a ray, a buzzsaw like apparatus held in the throat and more. Through it all, no one found a better specimen that depicted where the whorl was located. Just as with Edestus, experts could only guess what the entire animal looked like. More complete fossils were neededskeletons with cartilage of the skull, fins and the rest of the body intact but such specimens proved invisible. All paleontologists had to work with were the inscrutable tooth whorls. The nature of these fossil chondrichthyans didnt help scientists much. The very thing that sets chondrichthyans apart from bony fish, that their hard anatomy is mostly composed of cartilage, makes them difficult to preserve in most environmental settings, says Idaho Museum of Natural History paleontologist Leif Tapanila. Outside of exceptional circumstances, non mineralized cartilage usually decays away and leaves the harder parts behind. The way fossil experts went about studying fossil chondrichthyans didnt always help, either. Funnily enough, Tapanila says, sometimes the beauty of the teeth overshadows the potential for associated body parts. Experts of eras past would sometimes pick away rock to see the teeth and not realize that they were busting through remnants of cartilage. As many as one in 15 Helicoprion have jaw material preserved, but have historically gone unnoticed because of overzealous preparation, Tapanila says. But in those lucky cases where the fossils have remained intact, experts have now been able to glean some crucial clues. One of the best places in the world to find Helicoprion fossils is in Idaho, and the Idaho Museum of Natural History had a very impressive tooth whorl labeled IMNH 37899 in their collections. The fossil seemed like a good candidate for CT scans that might reveal new details of what the animal was like. What the researchers found were traces of cartilage around the jaw in the rock, remnants of the skull as well as the jaws that held the tooth whorl. This not only confirmed that the tooth whorl belonged in the lower jaw and was buttressed by cartilage, but that Helicoprion was more closely related to ratfish in the chondrichthyan family than to sharks. Paleontologists couldnt arrive at this conclusion until CT scans revealed what was invisible to the naked eye. Using similar techniques, Tapanila and colleagues then turned their attention to Edestus, again finding remnants of prehistoric cartilage that could not be detected before, and reconstructed what this shark like snipper looked like. Other research teams have taken similar approaches. In 2020, paleontologist Linda Frey and colleagues described another ancient shark like fish called Ferromirum. CT scans allowed the researchers to scan, visualize and manipulate the fishs skeletal elements in a way that has never been possible before. The teeth of this carnivores jaws rotated to point outward when the fish opened its mouth and inward when it closed them, a technique that presents a great number of teeth to prey through the bite cycle, as the researchers wrote. Taken together, all these saws, scissors and sharks would seem to suggest that cartilaginous fish of more than 250 million years ago were far stranger than anything alive today. No living equivalents of Edestus or Ferromirum exist. But familiarity often results in indifference. Paleoichthyologists have found that todays sharks and rays have actually evolved a greater array of different jaw shapesmouths suited to chomping, cutting, crushing, filter feeding and more than were present during the deep past. There are many different jaw and tooth types and ways of suspending the jaws from the skull in modern cartilaginous fish, University of Alaska Anchorage ichthyologist Cheryl Wilga says. She notes the jaws of goblin sharks, cookie cutter sharks, nurse sharks and more are all vastly different, suited to different prey and feeding, in a broader diversity of form than seen in the past. Both Edestus and Helicoprion, Tapanila points out, evolved to cut through soft prey with teeth arranged along the midline of the jaw. This kind of biting strategy made sense when the seas were full of fossil squid and cuttlefish relativesthe way the jaws of Helicoprion work might have even effectively shucked the soft parts of ammonites from their coiled shells. But this type of biting didnt persist. One thing we see in both Edestus and Helicoprion is that they both appear to be deadends to their respective lineages, Tapanila says, and the same type of predators never evolved again. These hunters were specialized, and they were very good at what they did. In the same deposits that paleontologists find Edestus jaws, for example, experts sometimes find fish tails that were lopped off the body, possible remnants of Edestus meals. \nAs much as paleontologists have learned about these mysterious fish, though, unanswered questions remain. Much of what scientist know of these fish comes from teeth, jaws and some skull cartilage. The rest of their appearance is often based on conjecture or rumored specimens. Im hoping one day to get a call from an East Idaho mine, Tapanila says, with a report of a Helicoprion body associated with the beautiful tooth whorl. And the fossil record may very well offer such a surprise one day. At the present moment, the body of Helicoprion is often envisioned as streamlined and shark like befitting a predatory fish. But the fossil record itself will provide the ultimate test. As a researcher, I cant let myself get too precious about my speculations, Tapanila says. The literature is filled with I told you sos."}, {"title": "How the Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Spurred the Evolution of the Modern Rainforest", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "April 1, 2021", "doc": "Before an asteroid lit the world on fire 66 million years ago, massive dinosaurs barged through tropical South American forests with airy, open canopies that were dominated by conifers and other seed bearing gymnospermsa group of plants that dont flower or bear fruit. Flowering plants or angiosperms, which make up roughly 80 percent of our modern flora, were there, too, but existed mainly in the margins. After the impact, three quarters of all plant and animal species on Earth went extinct. But new research suggests that out of the ashes of this destruction, sprang the closed canopy, flower packed South American rainforests that now host the greatest diversity of plants and animals on Earth. The study, published today in the journal Science, uses thousands of fossilized remnants of South American flora from before and after the world changing asteroid impact to reveal two very different forests on either side of a fracture in the history of life. What makes this paper so dramatic and elegant is that theyre addressing two questions that nobody could ever solve and solving them simultaneously, says Peter Wilf, a paleobotanist from Pennsylvania State University who was not involved in the research. Those two questions, says Wilf, are what happened in the tropics at the time the dinosaurs went extinct, and when did modern neotropical rainforests first appear. Until now, scant fossil records have obscured what effects the cataclysm had on the rainforests of South America. The oldest traces of the neotropics as scientists know them todaywith closed canopies dominated by flowering angiospermsdate to roughly 60 million years ago, which still leaves millions of years of evolution unaccounted for. But the fact that a modern looking rainforest was apparently thriving just six million years after the asteroid, only begged the second question of when these ecosystems first originated. To fill in the six million year gap in the fossil record, paleobiologist Carlos Jaramillo of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and the co authors of the new study assembled a massive database of fossilized pollen grains that spanned both sides of the asteroid impact and paired the pollen with a trove of new and old leaf fossils from sites in Colombia. Leaf fossils are hugely informative but relatively rare. They can usually be identified to the species level and reveal other things such as which plants lived in a particular area, how much sunlight a plant got or which types of insects ate its leaves. Pollen, on the other hand, can often only be identified to the family level and might have blown in from a long way off, making it less reliable as a localized census. But what pollen lacks in biological detail it more than makes up for with its ubiquity. Fossil pollen grains are abundant and easy to find in an array of different sediment types spanning nearly all time periods. Collecting tens of thousands of fossil pollen grains from 39 different sites allowed Jaramillo and his team to fill in the missing millions of years right around the mass extinction. Over more than a decade, Jaramillo worked with his collaborators and trained several crops of South American researchers to excavate and catalog the ancient flora of their home continent, amassing more than 6,000 fossil leaves and more than 50,000 grains of fossilized pollen. The scientists dated the pollen and leaf fossils using the previously established ages of the geological strata they were found in. Then, the scientists identified the specimens to the extent possible by comparing them to a huge library of living and previously studied extinct plant species. Identifying the plants represented in the fossils was a massive labor of taxonomy that Jaramillo says eventually allowed the team to determine which species were lost and gained following the asteroid impact. But to get at the question of how these fossil forests were structured, the researchers studied the fossil leaves using three newer techniques. In the first method, the scientists measured the density of the small veins that the leaves once used to transport nutrients to and from the rest of the plant. In living rainforest plants, canopy leaves have a high density of veins to make the most of the sunlight, while leaves from the understory, even on the same plant, have a lower density of veins. So, if an assortment of a forests leaves sports a big range of leaf venation densities, it suggests that the forest has a dense, stratified canopy. By contrast, forest leaf litter that exhibits relatively consistent vein densities typically comes from an ecosystem with an open canopy. For the second method, the researchers checked the ratio of a pair of carbon isotopescarbon 13 and carbon 12to infer how much sun beat down on a leaf when it was alive. If a collection of a forests leaves has roughly consistent ratios of carbon 12 to carbon 13 isotopes, then the forest probably had an open canopy. But if the forests leaves display a big range of carbon isotope ratios, that suggests a closed canopy where some leaves got blasted by solar radiation and others lived in near darkness. Finally, the team also inspected each fossil leaf for signs of insect damage. Different insects damage leaves in different ways and so the researchers could use these tell tale chomps and piercings to approximate the diversity of insects supported by the forest. The researchers used all these methods across thousands of samples from more than 40 sites in Colombia to establish a broad, regional picture of how the neotropics looked before and after the asteroid impact. All individual components of our analysis told us the same story, says Jaramillo. In the time of the dinosaurs, the rainforests of South America had open canopies dominated by conifers and other seed bearing gymnosperms. Members of the Araucariaceae genus, ancestors of todays Kauri pine and Norfolk Island pine, were common. Following the asteroids blast, the study finds roughly 45 percent of all plant diversity disappeared, particularly the gymnosperms. Amid the roughly six million year recovery, the flowering plants that reign supreme in todays neotropics quickly came to account for 85 to 90 percent of plant diversity, says Jaramillo.  The leaves of the fossilized angiosperms that repopulated South American rainforests exhibited wide ranges of leaf vein density and disparate ratios of stable carbon isotopes, suggesting the new forests had thick canopies that created a tiered hierarchy of access to sunlight. Though these early iterations of the modern neotropics were similar in structure and in the plant families that dominated their ranks compared to today, the overall diversity of species remained low until roughly six million years after the impact. This gives us a whole new window on where these hyper diverse tropical rainforests in South America came from, says Bonnie Jacobs, a paleobotanist at Southern Methodist University who co authored a commentary on the new paper for Science. With this paper you can kind of visualize the most amazing plant communities on Earth recovering and going down this deviated path after a mass extinction. Jaramillo and his team propose three potential explanations for why flowering plants rose to prominence after the asteroid that put a period on the age of the dinosaurs. The first explanation draws on a hypothesis that has been kicking around for decades, positing that the big bodied dinosaurs maintained the forests open floor plan simply by trampling the space between the large conifer trees and eating or snapping any saplings that sprang up. Then, once the dinosaurs were gone, the angiosperms closed ranks and filled in the forests gaps. A second explanation has to do with a change in soil nutrients. Some researchers think the asteroid impact might have dramatically increased the availability of nutrients in the soil, perhaps by raining down particulate and through the ashes of incinerated life. This would have given angiosperms a competitive advantage because they tend to grow faster than gymnosperms and outperform them in nutrient rich soils. The third explanation is that before the extinction event, conifers specialized in being the biggest trees around. This narrow life strategy might have made conifers more vulnerable to dying out, and if the group had no shrubby understory representatives to fill the ecological gap via evolution, the door would have been wide open for angiosperms to step in. Jaramillo says these explanations arent mutually exclusive, and it could have easily been some combination of all three that allowed flowering plants to become the dominant group in todays South American rainforests. But even as these findings highlight how a mass extinction gave rise to the modern pinnacle of biodiversity, researchers say it should also be a cause for reflection as humans cause what many call a sixth mass extinction event. This asteroid impact and the mass extinction it caused is actually a good analog for whats happening today, says Wilf. The asteroid and what humans are doing in terms of driving extinctions are instantaneous in geological time. This work shows how an ecosystem evolved and recovered after catastrophe, but it took millions of years, he says. That should really give us pause because we cant wait that long."}, {"title": "Discovery of a 95-Million-Year-Old \u2018Eagle Shark\u2019 Fossil Makes Waves ", "author": "Theresa Machemer", "date": "March 22, 2021", "doc": "The eagle shark was probably not as fearsome as its name suggests. The ancient shark, described on March 19 in the journal Science, was most likely a slow moving filter feeder that looked like a cross between a standard shark and a manta ray. But the eagle shark lived about 95 million years ago, 30 million years before modern rays appeared in the ocean. The find has paleontologists wondering of other ancient sharks took unusual shapes, since many are known only by the teeth they left behind. The eagle shark, or Aquilolomna milarcae, fossil has the opposite appearance an entire skeleton, but no teeth were preserved that would have helped paleontologists categorize it. The researchers took signs from other aspects of its anatomylike its broad head and wide, wing like finsto draw conclusions about the sharks behavior. As this shark probably fed on plankton, it didnt need to go fast, says Romain Vullo, first author of the new study and a paleontologist at the Universit\u00e9 de Rennes, to New Scientists Adam Vaughan. Like modern manta rays, relatively slow swimming was enough to eat plankton. A quarry worker found the unusual shark fossil in the Vallecillo limestone quarry in 2012. The region in northeastern Mexico is a well known repository of marine fossils like ammonites, fish and marine reptiles, according to a statement. Local paleontologist Margarito Gonz\u00e1lez Gonz\u00e1lez learned of the discovery and set to work carefully chipping away at the stone to reveal the fossil that was preserved within, Riley Black reports for National Geographic. My first thoughts on seeing the fossil were that this unique morphology is totally new and unknown among sharks, says Vullo to National Geographic. While its head and side fins are unusual, the eagle sharks tail and tail fins resemble those of modern sharks. So the researchers suggest that the shark probably used its tail to propel itself forward and its long side fins for stabilization. Manta rays have a different strategy, flapping their wide side fins to propel themselves forward. One of the most striking features of Aquilolamna is that it has very long, slender pectoral side fins, writes Vullo in an email to Laura Geggel at Live Science, This makes the shark wider than long, because it is just over six feet wide but only about 5.4 feet long. The fossil didnt show signs of a dorsal finthe notorious sign of an approaching shark that sticks up above the wateror of pelvic fins, which are on the underside of the shark. Its not yet clear whether the eagle shark lacked these fins, or if they just didnt fossilize, per Live Science. The biggest mystery surrounding the eagle shark comes from the lack of teeth in the fossil. Paleontologists rely on sharks teeth to identify them and figure out their evolutionary relationship to other ancient sharks. The eagle shark might have had tiny, pointed teeth like the basking shark and the megamouthtwo modern filter feeding sharksor taken a different strategy. It is truly unfortunate that no teeth were preserved in the specimen that could have allowed researchers to determine the exact taxonomic affinity of the new shark, says DePaul University paleobiologist Kenshu Shimada to National Geographic. For now, the research team used the shape of the fossils vertebrae and the skeleton of its tail fin to classify it as a shark in the order Lamniformes, which includes filter feeding sharks, mako sharks and the great white. Future fossilized finds and analysis of the eagle sharks anatomy could help scientists understand the strange shapes of sharks in the distant past. There are a lot of unusual features described by these authors, and I have some reservations about some of their interpretations, says Humboldt State University paleontologist Allison Bronson, who wasnt involved in the study, to National Geographic. Ao I would be excited to see further investigations of this new, remarkable fossil."}, {"title": "For the First Time, Paleontologists Unearth Fossil of Non-Avian Dinosaur Incubating a Nest of Eggs", "author": "Elizabeth Gamillo", "date": "March 18, 2021", "doc": "Within 70 million year old rock deposits located in southern Chinas Jiangxi Province, researchers unearthed a preserved fossil of an oviraptorosaur crouched over a nest of 24 eggs, reports Alaa Elassar for CNN. Seven of the eggs were on the verge of hatching, making this the only fossil on record to have evidence of a dinosaur brooding on eggs that still had embryonic material inside and the first hard evidence that this species of dinosaur incubated their young, reports Laura Geggel for Live Science. The study was published this month in Science Bulletin. Dinosaurs preserved on their nests are rare, and so are fossil embryos. This is the first time a non avian dinosaur has been found, sitting on a nest of eggs that preserve embryos, in a single spectacular specimen, says study co author Shundong Bi, a paleontologist at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, in a statement. Oviraptorosaurs, a type of theropod, were feathered dinosaurs with short, small parrot like skulls. They thrived during the Cretaceous period between 65.5 million and 145.5 million years ago, Live Science reports. Many of their fossilized remains are found preserved in Ganzhou area of southern China. The recently recovered oviratorosaur fossil found alongside the Ganzhou railway station is missing its skull and part of its vertebrae, but its forearms, hind legs, and part of its tail were preserved. Even more remarkably, the nest of two dozen oval shaped eggs underneath the adult dinosaur was also well preserved. Each of the eggs measured 8.5 inches long and three inches across, Live Science reports. In seven of the eggs, researchers found bones and embryos of the baby dinos in curled positions, reports Carly Cassella for Science Alert.  The parent dinosaur was found sitting above the eggs with its forearms covering the nest. A behavior researchers suspect shows that the dinosaur was incubating the eggs for a long time, in part because the preserved eggs were almost ready to hatch, per Live Science. In the new specimen, the babies were almost ready to hatch, which tells us beyond a doubt that this oviraptorid had tended its nest for quite a long time, says study co author and paleontologist Matt Lamanna in the statement. This dinosaur was a caring parent that ultimately gave its life while nurturing its young. To confirm the adult oviraptorosaurs was incubating the eggs, the researchers analyzed oxygen isotopes within the dinosaur embryos and fossilized eggshells, Live Science reports. The researchers found that the embryos were incubated at 86 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, which is consistent with the parent dinosaurs body temperature, Science Alert reports. Adding a layer of evidence that the oviraptorid may have been sitting on the nest to keep the eggs warm, reports Live Science. The fossilized find also contained gastroliths, or pebbles in the adult oviraptorosaurs abdominal region, revealing to researchers that these dinosaurs may have eaten stones to grind and digest food, reports CNN. This discovery is also the first time gastroliths were observed in an oviraptorid fossil. Its extraordinary to think how much biological information is captured in just this single fossil. Were going to be learning from this specimen for many years to come, said Xing Xu, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in a statement."}, {"title": "Why Medium-Sized Dinosaurs Are Often Missing From the Fossil Record", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "March 2, 2021", "doc": "In the age of the dinosaurs, it took a hatchling Tyrannosaurus rex about 20 years to reach its full adult size of between 12,000 and 18,000 pounds. Now, new research suggests that as they grew up, these massive meat eating dinosaurs exerted tyrannical influence over their prehistoric ecosystems by out competing medium sized predators, reports Laura Geggel for Live Science. The paper, published last week in the journal Science, seeks to explain the conspicuous absence of predators weighing between 220 pounds and 2,200 pounds as adults from the fossil record. The study surveyed more than 550 species from 43 dinosaur communities across 136 million years. Broadly, the researchers found lots of species that weighed under 220 pounds and over 2,200 pounds as adults, but very few in between. Speaking with Live Science, Katlin Schroeder, a paleontologist at the University of New Mexico and lead author of the study, proposes that juvenile T. rex and other immature big predators may have outcompeted other medium sized dinosaurs, resulting in deflated global dinosaur diversity. Schroeder tells Riley Black for New Scientist, that the implication is that were not missing medium sized dinosaurs from the fossil record because they didnt fossilize well or havent been collected, but that competition from juvenile megatheropods pushed them out of the ecosystem. This pattern stands in stark contrast to what we observe today in predator rich landscapes such as the Serengeti in Africa, where African wild dogs and servals fill in the mid sized range between mongooses and lions, according to New Scientist. This study puts numbers on something weve suspected but havent really proven that the biggest meat eating dinosaurs filled different niches in the food chain as they grew from miniature hatchlings into adults bigger than buses, Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved with the new research, tells George Dvorsky of Gizmodo. The basic idea is that a juvenile T. rex would have been slender and fast running compared to a hulking, bone crushing full grown adult, which might have positioned it to go after different prey that might have otherwise been fodder for a separate, medium sized species. The essential problem for would be, mid sized dinos was that even though there dont appear to have been many species of predatory dinosaurs that were medium sized as adults, functionally speaking, the presence of these lithe juvenile T. rex and their ilk meant were plenty of medium sized predators running around. That meant there wasnt actually a vacancy in the food web waiting to be exploited by species at that size. Per New Scientist, this ecological pattern might have emerged in the age of the dinosaurs partly because herbivores evolved to reach large sizes early on, spurring predators to become even bigger themselves. But even the biggest dinosaurs still had to hatch out of an egg, which limited their maximum size as hatchlings and set the stage for ravenous teenage T. rex terrorizing the ecosystems lower ranks. Bottom line is that throughout that entire time, its difficult to be a medium sized carnivore, Shroeder tells New Scientist."}, {"title": "Climate Change May Have Aided Dinosaurs\u2019 Journey From South America to Greenland", "author": "Elizabeth Gamillo", "date": "March 1, 2021", "doc": "In the Late Triassic period about 252 million years ago, the planet was mostly a vast arid desert assembled into the supercontinent Pangea. Meat eating dinosaurs roamed the planet with ease, expanding their range throughout the land. But herbivores, whose diet is dependent on an abundance of plants, were geographically confined to greener areas, including the largest dinosaursand land animalsthat ever lived a group of massive, long necked dinos called sauropodomorphs.  For millions of years, sauropodomorphs didnt really budge from their habitats in what is today Argentina and Braziluntil a dip in carbon dioxide CO2 levels occurred 215 million years ago, reports Chrissy Sexton for Earth.com. The shift in CO2 levels may have made it easier for a group of herbivores called sauropodomorphs to migrate North, according to a new study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In principle, the dinosaurs could have walked from almost one pole to the other. There was no ocean in between. There were no big mountains. And yet it took 15 million years. Its as if snails could have done it faster, says Dennis Kent, study co author and geologist at Columbia University, in a statement. It was previously thought that sauropodomorphs migrated to Greenland around 205 million to 225 million years ago. By measuring magnetism patterns within ancient rocks from South America, Arizona, New Jersey, Europe and Greenland, the authors of the new study found that the herbivores actually migrated closer to 214 million years ago, a time where Earths climate was rapidly changing, reports Anushree Dave for Science News. During the late Triassic period between 215 million to 233 million years ago, Earth had extremely high carbon dioxide levels at 4,000 parts per million, Science News reports. The high CO2 levels would have made dry environments extremely arid and wet environments monsoonal, limiting the amount of plants the herbivores could feast on while migrating, reports Harry Cockburn for the Independent. Between 212 million and 215 million years ago when the sauropodomorphs arrived in Greenland, carbon dioxide levels were halved at 2,000 parts per million, leaving researchers to suspect that this event may have made conditions on Earth more hospitable. Tropical regions likely became more mild and arid regions became less dry, allowing sauropodomorphs to migrate North, reports the Independent. Researchers have found an abundance of sauropod fossils in what is now Greenland, suggesting that the climate and environment was suitable for the dinosaurs and they decided to stick around. Once they arrived in Greenland, it looked like they settled in. They hung around as a long fossil record after that, Kent tells the Independent. Fossilized footprints of these long necked dinosaurs are found in tropical and arid regions, but their bodies are not, suggesting they were only passing through while on their journey to Greenland, reports the Independent. This study reminds us that we cant understand evolution without understanding climate and environment, says Steve Brusatte, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved with the study, to Science News. Even the biggest and most awesome creatures that ever lived were still kept in check by the whims of climate change."}, {"title": "Oldest DNA Sequenced Yet Comes From Million-Year-Old Mammoths", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "February 17, 2021", "doc": "Woolly mammoths were icons of the Ice Age. Starting 700,000 years ago to just 4,000 years ago, they trundled across the chilly steppe of Eurasia and North America. As ancient glaciers expanded across the Northern Hemisphere, these beasts survived the rapidly cooling temperatures with cold resistant traits, a characteristic they came by not through evolution, as earlier thought. Woolly mammoths, a new Nature study finds, inherited the traits that made them so successful from a mammoth species closer to a million years old. The clues come from some incredibly old DNA extracted from a trio of molars uncovered in northeastern Siberia. The oldest is nicknamed the Krestovka mammoth, dated to about 1.2 million years ago. The other two molars are nicknamed the Adycha and Chukochya mammoths, dated to 1 million and 500,000 to 800,000 years old, respectively. The fact that the researchers were able to extract and analyze the DNA from these fossils at all is a landmark. Up until now, the oldest look at ancient genes came from an Ice Age horse that lived over 560,000 years ago. The new mammoth samples double that, taking the title for the oldest DNA yet recovered from fossil remains. We had to deal with DNA that was significantly more degraded compared to the horse, says Swedish Museum of Natural History paleogeneticist Love Dal\u00e9n, an author of the new study. Understanding such ancient genetic material is a challenge because DNA begins to decay at death. Ancient DNA samples can sometimes become contaminated by modern sources. While preserved snippets of the ancient horses DNA were about 78 base pairs long, the fragments of mammoth DNA were about 42 49 base pairs long. Dal\u00e9n says it can be sometimes difficult to tell which short snippets are from the mammoth and which should be disregarded as modern contamination from bacteria or people. The researchers compared the DNA results of the three teeth to elephants and humans, and discarded any data that seemed like it could have come from humans. The emerging picture painted by the ancient DNA is different from what researchers expected. It is indeed a fascinating paper, says American Museum of Natural History paleontologist Ross MacPhee, who was not involved with the new study, both for setting a new landmark for ancient DNA but also for finding evidence that at least one mammoth species originated as a hybrid. The story began over a million years ago in Eurasia, when a large species that preceded the woolly mammoth, called the steppe mammoth, Mammuthus trogontherii, lived. These mammoths arent as well known as the woolies and most of whats been uncovered about them comes from bones alone rather than carcasses with tatters of soft tissue. No one knew whether these beasts were adapted to the cold or not, with the supposition being that the steppe mammoths thrived during warmer interglacial periods and woolly mammoths evolved from the steppe mammoths when the ice expanded its hold on the planet. Yet the researchers found that the older, million year old mammoths had genes for shaggy coats and some other physiological adaptations for life in cold habitats, meaning that the woolies inherited many of their characteristic features. The molar referred to as the Adycha mammoth, at about a million years old and resembling that of a steppe mammoth, contains the genetic markers for these traits even though the mammoth lived hundreds of thousands of years before woolies. What this finding hints, Dal\u00e9n says, is that many of the critical traits that allowed mammoths to populate cold regions happened much earlierperhaps during the evolution of the steppe mammoth from its hypothesized ancestor around 1.7 million years ago. In their genetic analysis, Dal\u00e9n and colleagues also examined how the three ancient mammoths related to other known specimens and species. The Krestovka mammoth, at about 1.2 million years old, came out as a unique lineage of mammoth that didnt fit into any previously known species. And this newly discovered mammoth lineage had an important role to play. The researchers hypothesize that Mammuthus columbia huge species the roamed North America from 10,500 to 1.5 million years agooriginated as a hybrid between the ancestors of the woolly mammoth and the genetic lineage of the Krestovka mammoth. That certainly came as a complete surprise to us, Dal\u00e9n says. That Mammuthus columbi originated as a new species, born of a hybridization event, has major implications for our understanding of the population structure of Pleistocene megabeasts, MacPhee says. The ancestors of the woolly mammoth and the Krestova mammoth had diverged from each other for about a million years before a population produced a hybrid that was different from both, giving rise to Mammuthus columbi. More than that, MacPhee notes, it suggests that mammoths in the Old and New Worlds acted as a hugely distributed metapopulation, with populations able to interbreed with each other despite looking different from each other. The study is hardly the final word on the mammoth family tree, of course. Paleogeneticists and paleontologists are just beginning to understand how all these mammoths are related. In North America, for example, some fossils were labeled by 20th century paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn as Jeffersons mammoth and sometimes these fossils are categorized as a unique species. The suspicion among experts is that these mammoths are hybrids between woolly mammoths and Mammuthus columbi, an idea that can be tested against the genetic evidence. North American mammoths dated to about 126,000 to 770,000 years ago, Dal\u00e9n says, might hold additional genetic clues about how mammoth species hybridized with each other to give rise to new forms of mammoth through time. Ancient genes are revealing that the Ice Age world was very different from our own. Megafauna thrived through the worlds continents, and those animals may have had genetic connections to each other that extinction has obscured. We dont think of megabeast species being able to maintain multicontinental ranges these days, but that must at least be partly due to the fact that humans have disrupted their ranges, population structure and mating opportunities for millennia, MacPhee says."}, {"title": "Meet Massachusetts\u2019 Official State Dinosaur  ", "author": "Elizabeth Gamillo", "date": "February 11, 2021", "doc": "Meet Massachusetts official state dinosaur Podokesaurus holyokensis, a mid Jurassic era dino with a light and delicate frame that likely weighed in at 90 pounds and measured about three to six feet in length.

Selecting the candidates was easy because only two dinosaur species have been excavated in Massachusetts Podokesaurus holyokensis and Anchisaurus polyzelus. The idea of picking a state dinosaur came to Massachusetts state representative Jack Lewis while brainstorming Covid safe projects for his childs cub scouts chapter that would engage the scouts in both science and the legislative process. In January, Lewis used Twitter to announce his plan on introducing a bill to declare a state dinosaur. He asked Massachusetts residents to vote between two dinosaurs Podokesaurus holyokensis and Anchisaurus polyzelus, reports Morrison for Mass Live on January 4.

As we move forward with naming a state dinosaur, kids will learn the names of dinosaurs that lived here in Massachusetts. This emphasizes the fact that dinosaur bones and tracks exist right under our feet. The voter favorite, Podokesaurus holyokensis, lived during the mid Jurassic period, 195 180 million years ago, in what is now Massachusetts. In 1910 near Mount Holyoke College, the swift footed lizards remains were first unearthed by American paleontologist and professor Mignon Talbot. Talbot, the first female scientist to name and describe a dinosaur, wrote in The American Journal of Science in 1911 that the dinosaur had a light and delicate frame and was excellently preserved, reports Atlas Obscura. Lewis hopes that selecting a state dinosaur inspires students to learn about the legislative process and paleontology and inspire young girls to explore STEM careers. There is also such great energy around how this project can not only elevate Professor Mignon Talbot, and make sure that her story is more well known, but also how to ensure that fields like paleontology, which historically have not been fields of study that women have been attracted to in the same numbers as men, but how we can reflect on the role of women in science and the role of inspiring todays younger generation of women, Lewis tells Mass Live. If the two bills submitted on February 4 by Lewis pass, Massachusetts will join 12 other states and Washington, D.C., in selecting an official state dinosaur.

The 66 million year old saltwater terrors saw like teeth are a razor sharp departure from the pointed or cone shaped chompers of all other known reptiles, instead most closely resembling the flesh shearing dentition of certain species of sharks. Phosphate miners in Moroccos Khouribga province first discovered the new mosasaur, and researchers were fascinated as soon as they laid eyes on its jaws, reports Laura Geggel of Live Science. The creature is aptly named Xenodens calminechari, which is Latin for strange tooth and Arabic for like a saw, respectively Those teeth are just unlike anything Ive seen in a lizard before, Nick Longrich, a paleontologist at the University of Bath and lead author of a paper describing the species that was published last month in the journal Cretaceous Research, tells Science News. In a statement, co author Nathalie Bardet, a paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, adds I have been working on mosasaurs for over 20 years...I must admit that among the 10 species that I know, this one has a so unusual and extraordinary dentition that at the beginning I thought it was a chimera reconstructed with different fossils Mosasaurs first appeared some 120 million years ago and reached lengths of more than 40 feetand exhibited a huge range of feeding habits with teeth to match. X. calminechari inhabited the warm seas that once covered North Africa, which Longrich says were teeming with deadly predators at the time. Sixty six million years ago, the coasts of Africa were the most dangerous seas in the world, says Longrich in the statement. Predator diversity there was unlike anything seen anywhere else on the planet...A huge diversity of mosasaurs lived here. Some were giant, deep diving predators like modern sperm whales, others with huge teeth and growing up to ten meters long, were top predators like orcas, still others ate shellfish like modern sea ottersand then there was the strange little Xenodens. Researchers say that despite its unimpressive size, X. calminecharis formidable teeth might have allowed it to take bites out of larger prey. That added dietary flexibility would have been key to its survival in such perilous waters. The closest modern match for this mosasaurs bite are the dogfish sharks, which use their serrated teeth to scavenge from large corpses and to slice up smaller prey. The appearance of X. calminecharis unique take on mosasaur life just before the dinosaurs met their end paints an interesting picture of the groups evolution and suggests a thriving ecosystem, Longrich tells Science News.

At the end of January, four year old Lily Wilder spotted a dinosaur footprint on the beach at Bendricks Bay in Wales, Steve Inskeep reports for NPR. Now, that footprint is on its way to a museum. The bay is well knownand protected by the Geological Society of Londonfor its fossilized footprints and layers of sediment deposits. The rock formation is about 220 million years old, and the first dinosaurs appeared about 230 million years ago, so the footprints at Bendricks Bay are a mix of early dinosaur and crocodilian species. The footprint that Lily found is one of the regions best preserved footprints, National Museum Wales says in a statement. Luckily, it was at just the right height for an observant kid to see it. It was on a low rock, shoulder height for Lily, and she just spotted it and said, look Daddy, says Lilys mother, Sally Wilder, to NBC News Adela Suliman. She is really excited but doesnt quite grasp how amazing it is. Lily told NBC News that she loves dinosaurs her favorite is the T Rex and has a collection of toys and models. Lilys father, Richard, took photographs of the footprint and shared them with their family, and Lilys grandmother encouraged them to connect with experts who could take a closer look at the print. Many of the footprints immortalized in Bendricks Bay were left by ancient crocodilians, but the footprint that Lily found was made by a primitive dinosaur. The four inch long print is an example of a grallator, which is made by a three toed, bipedal dinosaur, Stephanie Pappas writes for Live Science. The dinosaur that left the track was probably about 30 inches tall and eight feet long, and a carnivore that hunted small animals and insects, Chris Wood reports for BBC News. Museum paleontologists couldnt identify the species of dinosaur that left the track because no bones from a matching species have been found in the United Kingdom. A similar dinosaur called a Coelophysis once lived in whats now North America, but has not been found in the U.K. The footprint is one of the best preserved examples from anywhere in the U.K. and will really aid paleontologists to get a better idea about how these early dinosaurs walked, says Amgueddfa Cymru National Museum Wales paleontology curator Cindy Howells in the statement. Howells adds to NBC News, It really is stunning preservation ... You can see every detail of the muscles and where the joints are in the foot. The footprint was removed from the bay after the National Museum Cardiff got approval from Natural Resources Wales to do so. Removing prints from the bay is illegal. The print will go to the museums collections, where it can be used for research. When it goes on display, Lilys name will be listed beside it."}, {"title": "New Way to Study Magnetic Fossils Could Help Unearth Their Origins", "author": "Abigail Eisenstadt", "date": "February 1st, 2021, 3:00PM", "doc": "Smithsonian Voices  National Museum of Natural History \n\n Deep underneath the oceans murky floor, there are iron bullets, needles, and spearheads. But they werent left there by people. Instead, they are the fossilized remains of unknown organisms who lived millions of years ago through at least two extreme global warming events.  These so called giant magnetofossils are impossible to see with the naked eye. Because of their size, geologists and paleobiologists used to have to study them using a labor intensive and destructive process.  Now, a team at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History, University of Utah and Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics, Austria has developed a better method for studying these enigmatic, tiny specimens. Their research published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences will make it easier for scientists to learn about the fossils.  If we can find more of these magnetofossils, we can build a better picture of past environmental change, which in turn could help us anticipate future global change, said Dr. Ioan Lascu, a research geologist and Edward and Helen Hintz Secretarial Scholar in the museums Department of Mineral Sciences, who co authored the paper.  An unconventional magnetofossil   There are two types of magnetic fossils conventional and giant. The conventional ones are one one thousandth the width of a human hair, formed by bacteria that create iron particles to interact with Earths magnetic field and help them move. These magnetotactic bacteria still exist today and live in many different types of aquatic environments.  Giant magnetofossils, however, are so far only found in ocean sediments. They are one hundredth the width of a human hair, making them giant compared to their conventional counterparts. Geologists know they were formed by living creatures because of their unique shapes.  These fossils are crazy. Some are shaped like needles and spindles, while others look like arrowheads. One of the more common ones is probably the giant bullet, said Courtney Wagner, a PhD candidate at the University of Utah, former Robert Hevey and Constance M. Filling Fellow in the museums Department of Mineral Sciences and lead author of the paper. And because they have these shapes, when we find them in the sedimentary record, we know theyre made by some sort of organism. The fossils were first discovered in 2008, but scientists still dont know what creature made them. They have since been dated to the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum PETM around 56 million years ago and the Mid Eocene Climatic Optimum MECO roughly 40 million years ago.  Their presence in periods of environmental upheaval suggests they could be signposts in the fossil record that indicate episodes of climate change.  Our bigger picture goal is to figure out exactly what made these fossils and why they appeared during global warming events that happen to be analogs for modern climate change, said Wagner.  Testing fossils of unusual origin Studying giant magnetofossils requires a lot of material. With the old, destructive method, that meant powdering marine sediment and imaging the powder with an electron microscope. But Wagner and her co authors, including Dr. Ramon Egli of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics in Austria, developed a non destructive method that can detect needle shaped giant magnetofossils because their shape generates a specific magnetic signature.  We took a sediment chip about half the size of a pinky nail and put it between two really big magnets. We then applied a strong magnetic field in one direction, reversed the field direction, and repeated this a bunch of times. This, in a way, let us measure the magnetic equivalent to the physical fitness properties of the fossils in the sample, said Wagner.  The team double checked their results by examining the fossils with the electron microscope. They then triple checked the findings by running a computer simulation of virtual needle shaped particles in a magnetic field.  All of our three tests  new magnetic method, classic imaging, and computer model  agreed with one another, said Wagner.  The positives of the new method  Being able to remotely sense iron fossils in sediments will help geologists who are searching for them in samples from even older eras.  The next step is looking for these specimens in other time periods. We mostly have found them in sediment younger than 65 million years old, said Lascu. Going further back in time, we really dont know how they, or the organisms that made them, evolved.  Now that scientists can detect these fossils in geologic materials faster, they will be able to look for past evidence of the fossils more efficiently.  This will help advance our community a lot, because we can test multiple samples more quickly in order to learn more about the fossils said Wagner. It will help us figure out if the fossils are truly restricted to warming events or not.  Theres also one other question that Lascu and Wagner hope will be answered.  Why do these exist? said Lascu. Its mindboggling. We still havent found the critters that make them.

But for our ancestors, the uses were much simpler. Strong and nimble thumbs meant that they could better create and wield tools, stones and bones for killing large animals for food. Because developing dexterous, opposable thumbs pushed our ancestors to make and use tools, eat more meat and grow bigger brains, scientists have long wondered if such thumbs began only with our own genus, Homo, or among some earlier species. Now a new study combines the ancient evidence of fossil fingers and thumbs with cutting edge computer muscle modeling to conclude that South African hominins boasted flexible, capable thumbs much like ours as far back as two million years ago. It is remarkable that such a level of thumb dexterity, similar to that of people living today, would be observed in hominins alive two million years ago, says Katerina Harvati, a paleoanthropologist at the Senckenberg Center for Human Evolution and Paleoenvironment, University of Tu\u0308bingen Germany. That time period is a notable one as it came before major evolutionary events, including the rise of the large brained Homo erectus 1.9 million years ago, that speciess dispersal outside Africa 1.8 million years ago and the replacement of primitive stone tools by sophisticated Acheulean handaxes about 1.76 million years ago. We believe that thumb dexterity constituted a crucial evolutionary advantage which likely enabled the subsequent gradual development of complex culture in our lineage, says Harvati, co author of the new study published in Current Biology. Shorter thumbs and longer fingers are helpful for climbing. But as our ancestors forsook life in the trees, and increasingly began to make and manipulate objects, shorter fingers and longer opposable thumbs would have produced a hand assembly that got better and better at grasping. Over time natural selection could have refined these anatomical changes based on the many ways humans used their hands and which of those proved most rewarding, like smashing animal bones to collect their high energy marrow. Tracy Kivell, a paleoanthropologist not involved in the study who specializes in the morphology of primate hands at the University of Kent and Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, notes that many primates with different hands are capable of precise and powerful grips. But humans excel at precision grips that match the pad of the thumb to the pads of the fingersand for those a powerful thumb is essential. Experimental studies have shown that humans use forceful precision grips when they make and use stone tools, so its often thought that this ability in humans evolved in response to tool use, Kivell says. Anthropologists have spent a lot to time comparing hand, finger and thumb fragments left behind by species across many branches of the human family tree over millions of years to see where and when this ability developed. Such straightforward comparisons of thumb and finger shapes and their similarity to our own are useful but they dont tell the whole story, because in nature, different shapes and forms sometimes perform in similar ways. So Harvati and colleagues put some digital flesh on varied bones. The team compared fossilized hands and thumbs of a suite of species ranging from Australopithecus afarensis, at nearly four million years old, to early Homo sapiens, to Homo naledi to modern chimpanzees and humans. Among those specimens were some intriguing two million year old hand bones from South Africas Swartkrans cave, that may be either early Homo or Australopithecus robustus. They then used a biomechanics model to recreate how muscles would have been able to manipulate those various thumbs, providing a look at how they once functioned. The team first tested the accuracy of the models by using them on living humans and chimps with known muscle parameters. The models calculations closely matched experimental study results for those species, which gave the authors confidence that their approach could reliably reconstruct dexterity in the fossilized hands. Kivell says that musculoskeletal modeling isnt often used in paleontology simply because muscle data isnt part of the fossil record. It must come from living species. They used human and chimpanzee muscle data to offer two potential extremes for what muscle size and force might have been in fossil hominins, Kivell says. Although there are a lot of caveats and unknowns, I think its still an informative approach to use. The study found that two million years ago the inhabitants of Swartkrans cave in South Africa, had surprisingly high efficiency, much like our own, in the act of bringing the thumb and fingers together. Scientists dont know which species these hands belong to because Paranthropus robustus and early Homo remains were both found in the cave during this time period. Very efficient thumb opposition appeared in all members of our own genus Homo that were tested in the study. Those included modern humans but also early Homo sapiens, Neanderthals and even the small brained species Homo naledi. This last species is intriguing, since Homo naledi hasnt yet been associated with tools and has a small brain that might or might not have been capable of human like cognitive abilities. This does not mean that it necessarily made and used tools, but that it would have been able to, from the point of view of its manual capacities, Harvati says. On the other hand, the study found that hominids of the genus Australopithecus, which might have been the first hominins known to make very simple tools 3.3 million years ago, scored quite low in thumb dexterity. Previous studies of hand morphology have suggested that Australopithecus africanus had a human like ability to grip with an opposable thumb two to three million years ago. The hand of Australopithecus sediba features a long thumb, in relation to the rest of the hand, that other scholars have deemed well suited for grasping and manipulation of objects use much like our own. While Australopithecus thumbs tend to be long they are also thin, suggesting they wouldve been less powerful than human thumbs. Harvatis group believes that a more complete look at the hands various bones and joints, along with their muscle reconstruction, also suggest a low range of motion and more limited thumb dexterity. That doesnt mean that Australopithecus couldnt make tools. But it suggests that if they did, they may have demonstrated a different kind of hand dexterity that we and our closer relatives in the genus Homo enjoyed. Australopiths could still be dextrous, capable of tool making and use, even if their thumb is not as powerful as that of humans, says Kivell. Of course, if the Swartkrans hands actually belonged to Australopithecus Paranthropus robustus, rather than to an early Homo species, they would suggest that parallel evolution occurred among the two distinct lineages. Neil Thomas Roach, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University not involved with the research, says the studys compelling case that shifts in both hand bones and their associated muscles occurred after the earliest tools appeared isnt surprising. But it is illustrative. To me, this reflects one of the most fascinating dilemmas about tool use, namely, who is responsible and how can we know? he says. It just might be possible that such questions arent the right ones and that data like these show that regardless of when the innovation occurred, it was such a fundamental advantage that it became widely adopted across multiple species. When the studys results are considered alongside the archaeological evidence, they support a coherent theory. Some two million years ago hominins began to increasingly rely on tools and feast on animal fats and proteins. This suggests a shift in hand use at this time that roughly corresponds to the disappearance of Australopiths and greater diversity in Homo species, says Kivell. The process of making and using increasingly complex tools requires more than dexterous thumbs and hand and eye coordination. Prehistoric toolmakers also must have displayed some levels of forethought, planning and learning along the way. That required better brains, which might have been fed by a meaty diet made possible by better tools, which were crafted by increasingly more capable brains. Tool use and cognitive abilities, even possibly including language, are often thought to be part of a complex feedback loop, one reinforcing the other through human evolution, Harvati says. Exploring which other key evolutionary factors helped to drive the physical and cognitive evolution that led to modern humans is the next step for Harvati and colleagues. While our study only looked at a small component, the thumb, we plan to expand our work to directly address these questions."}, {"title": "Enormous Prehistoric Marine Worms\u2019 Lair Discovered Along Sea Floor ", "author": "Elizabeth Gamillo", "date": "January 26, 2021", "doc": "Camouflaged in sandy loam, ancient giant worms waited for unsuspecting prey to swim within their reach and then suddenly emerge from the ground in a snap to pull fish to their demise. Now, 20 million years later, researchers have uncovered these colossal sea predators hideaways, according to a study published this month in Scientific Reports. The burrow may be the earliest known fossil of an ambush predator. The L shaped lair found imprinted in ancient seafloor sediment from Taiwan measured about 7 feet long and one inch wide, reports Mindy Weisberger for Live Science. The worms that burrowed in these tunnels may have been the ancestors of modern Bobbit worms, Eunice aphtoditois. Bobbit worms or bristle worms have been around since the Cambrian period, reports Live Science, and they can be anywhere between a few inches to 10 feet long. The worms also have sharp teeth, hide within the ocean floor, and use their antenna to sense when prey is nearby. When the Bobbit worm feels something above them, it will lunge out of the sand to snatch and gobble up the ill fated prey. The trace fossils were first unearthed in the Yehliu Geopark and Badouzi promontory in Taiwan by accident. Kochi University biologist Masakazu Nara was looking at the rocky sediment for evidence of stingray feeding behavior. Instead, Nara found the secret caves of the ancient sea worms reports, Riley Black for National Geographic. At first, scientists did not understand what constructed the underground burrows. Many other sea animals like clams, crustaceans, and sea urchins also burrow into the seafloor. From a total of 319 fossil specimens found, scientists saw the worms left a funnel like structure at the start of the tunnel reports, Helen Thompson for Science News. The strange form hinted towards the animal living within these burrows was violent by nature, with the flared entrance likely a sign of a predator moving in and out of the den, reports Ian Sample for the Guardian. Its not one feature that convinced us this burrow was made by a worm but the combination of features. The funnels indicate a violent event, paleontologist and study co author Ludvig L\u00f6wemark tells National Geographic. Researchers also found iron deposits along the top of tunnels walls, reports Science News. The iron deposits were most likely leftover from mucus used to reinforce damaged walls after the worms snatched up their prey, says Live Science. There are no fossilized remains of the worms themselves, however, because finding preserved soft tissues is rare. The evidence found suggests that if the worms were the ones who made the tunnels, it could be an ancient example of invertebrates hunting vertebrates, reports Science News."}, {"title": "Dinosaur Unearthed in Argentina Could Be Largest Land Animal Ever", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "January 22, 2021", "doc": "The fossilized bones of what may have been the largest animal ever to walk the Earth are slowly emerging from the ground in Argentina, reports Amy Woodyatt for CNN. Beginning in 2012, paleontologists set about excavating a hulking set of 24 vertebrae as well as elements of the pelvis and pectoral girdle from the Candeleros Formation in Argentinas Neuqu\u00e9n Province. At first, it wasnt clear to researchers what theyd found, only that it was enormous. Now, in a new paper published this month in the journal Cretaceous Research, paleontologists say the remains suggest a type of long necked, plant eating dinosaur called a titanosaur, potentially the largest ever unearthed. They cant yet speculate as to whether the gigantic bones belong to a known species or something new entirely, but, per CNN, the team says that the specimen could be even bigger than a 122 foot, nearly 70 ton titanosaur called Patagontitan. Researchers have dated the new specimen to around 98 million years ago, reports Harry Baker for Live Science. Given the measurements of the new skeleton, it looks likely that this is a contender for one of the largest, if not the largest, sauropods that have ever been found, Paul Barrett, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum in London who was not involved in the study, tells Live Science. This new skeleton provides yet another example of sauropods pushing at the extremes of whats possible with respect to maximum animal size on land. To reach a conclusion regarding the behemoths species and more accurately estimate its size, researchers will need to keep digging. David Bressan reports for Forbes that load bearing bones such as the femur and humerus would go a long way towards facilitating such estimates. It is a huge dinosaur, but we expect to find much more of the skeleton in future field trips, so well have the possibility to address with confidence how really big it was, Alejandro Otero, a paleontologist with Argentinas Museo de La Plata and lead author of the paper, tells CNN via email. As Bressan notes in Forbes, though dinosaurs like the titanosaurs reached lengths well more than 100 feet, they fail to mount a serious challenge for the title of the largest animal ever to have lived on our planet. That accolade goes to a giant that is still with us today the blue whale, which can reach lengths of more than 100 feet and, because its heft is supported by water, weigh up to 173 tons."}, {"title": "Ancient Insect Genitals Found in 50-Million-Year-Old Fossil", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "January 19, 2021", "doc": "The fossil record is a lot more than just giant dinosaurs. In fact, some of the most impressive fossils are not hulking, pillar like bones but the remains of small, delicate organisms that were buried in just the right conditions to reveal lost worlds to us millions of years after their deaths. A fossil bug recovered from the ancient strata of Colorado offers one such window into the past. The fossil assassin bug, described today in Papers in Palaeontology, has perked paleontological attention because the rare specimen has its genitals intact. Chipped out of 50 million year old rock, the bug is so exquisitely preserved that it almost looks ready to crawl out of the stone. Even the colored bands along the insects legs and body are visible. And just like exceptional circumstances were needed for the fossil to form, a lucky break was also needed to piece together this Eocene insects story. The insect comes from a time when vast lakes covered swaths of what would become the western United States. Surrounded by warm, semitropical forests that hosted lemur relatives, early bats and other creatures, these lakes quickly buried organisms that settled to the mucky, oxygen poor bottom and pressed many of them paper thin over 50 million years. Known as the Green River Formation, this rock unit has yielded some of the most exquisite and detailed fossils ever found. Paleontologists arent the only people interested in Green River fossils. Privately owned quarries specialize in extracting, cleaning and selling fossils from the Green River Formation, especially rare species. Thats how half of the fossil assassin bug featured in the study came into the possession of private fossil collector and study co author Yinan Wang. Word had it that the other half was owned by another private collector, Dan Judd, who donated the second piece to the researchers behind the new study. The fossil assassin bug is named Aphelicophontes danjuddi in honor of Judds donation. What makes it truly special is that the genitals of this fossil bug can be seen in detaila critical anatomical aspect that entomologists often use to distinguish assassin bugs from each other. In technical terms, says University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign entomologist and study co author Daniel Swanson, the genital organ of the assassin bug is called a pygophore. The word comes from two Ancient Greek roots that literally mean rump and something that carries, Swanson says. The organ is a hardened anatomical cup that surrounds the genitals just like the bugs exosekeleton surrounds the body. And despite being about 50 million years old, Aphelicophontes danjuddi has genitals similar to assassin bugs todaythe basic setup has remained the same since the Eocene, even as subtle differences distinguish one species from another. This is definitely an example of exceptional preservation, says University of Colorado Boulder paleontologist Dena Smith, who was not involved in the new study. To start with, assassin bugs are rare in the fossil record. Despite there being over 7,000 species of these familiar bugs alive today, only about 50 have ever been found as fossils. More than that, Aphelicophontes danjuddi isnt merely a fragment or an impression. The entire animal down to its reproductive anatomy has been preserved. Genitalia are important characteristics of insects that are often used to describe and define species, Smith says, especially because they are so seldom seen in fossil assassin bugs. For these arthropods, genital anatomy is as distinctive as a fingerprint in determining whos who. Finding direct evidence of fossil genitals is relatively rare. Even in cases where mating animals have been foundsuch as courting sharks or prehistoric turtles caught en flagrantethe actual soft tissue anatomy is usually missing. The same goes for insects. Fossil arthropods have been found in mating positions before, but actually being able to clearly see their genital anatomy is practically unheard of. The preserved pygophore isnt the only reason the find of Aphelicophontes danjuddi is important. While the Green River Formation is famous for the exceptional vertebrates that have been found therefrom crocodiles to early horses and birds preserved with feathersinsects can often reveal much more about the prehistoric habitat. Many insect groups have fairly specific environmental needs for their growth and development, Smith says, which can be used to provide information about past environmental conditions. At Green River Formation sites in Wyoming, for instance, paleontologists have found that particular species of prehistoric plants grew in small pocketsrather than spreading everywhere. These plants supported unique insect communities, which researchers detected by looking at patterns of leaf damage. Assassin bugs, for their part, likely preyed on these herbivorous insects, and so now paleontologists can see how insects like Aphelicophontes danjuddi fit into the broader patterns of who lived where. Insects like the new assassin bug also formed an important part of ancient food webs, too, especially because they often served as meals for many of the charismatic vertebrates that often nab the spotlight. In 2019, researchers named a finch like bird called Psittacopes from the same formation. This birds beak was specifically adapted to plucking insects off bark, and Aphelicophontes danjuddi could have certainly been on the menu. Studying fossil insects not only allows us to understand past ecosystems, Smith says, but also helps us to understand the evolutionary history and ecology of this important group."}, {"title": "Dire Wolves Weren\u2019t Actually Wolves, DNA Analysis Reveals", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "January 15, 2021", "doc": "Dire wolves have lunged into the public imagination through their enormous and fearsome fictional representation in Game of Thrones. Though the show exaggerates their sizethey were only about 20 percent larger than todays gray wolvesthese prehistoric canines were very real and very deadly hunters that roamed North America until roughly 13,000 years ago. But now, new research published this week in the journal Nature reveals that the real animal diverges from what you may have seen on TV in a more fundamental way. When researchers sequenced the extinct predators genome, they found it wasnt a wolf at all but instead a distinct lineage that split off from the rest of the canines some 5.7 million years ago, reports James Gorman for the New York Times. The startling result upends the notion that the dire wolf was a sister species to the gray wolf and adds precious evolutionary detail to a species that was once a common sight in North America. More than 4,000 of the creatures have been pulled from the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles alone, reports Angela Watercutter for Wired. To reveal the dire wolfs true evolutionary identity, researchers extracted DNA from five fossils between 13,000 and 50,000 years old and sequenced their genomes. The team ultimately recovered around a quarter of the nuclear genome and a full complement of mitochondrial DNA from the samples, writes David Grimm for Science. Though the bones of the dire wolf are so similar to todays gray wolves that paleontologists sometimes have trouble telling them apart, the genes told an entirely different story when researchers compared them to those of living canine species. Even though they look like wolves, dire wolves actually have nothing to do with wolves, Angela Perri, a zooarchaeologist at Durham University and one of the studys lead authors, tells Science. In addition to not being part of the wolfs evolutionary tribe, the dire wolf DNA also showed that the species lineage is separate from the other living branches of the canine evolutionary tree, including African jackals, coyotes and dogs. These results totally shake up the idea that dire wolves were just bigger cousins of gray wolves, Yukon paleontologist Grant Zazula, who was not involved in the new study, tells Riley Black for Scientific American. The study of ancient DNA and proteins from fossil bones is rapidly rewriting the ice age and more recent history of North Americas mammals. To reflect the dire wolfs now lonely perch on its very own branch of the canine evolutionary tree, researchers propose giving it a new scientific name Aenocyon dirus. Speaking with Scientific American, Perri admits that the new findings likely wont cause the whole world to abandon the common name dire wolf. They will just join the club of things like maned wolves that are called wolves but arent really, says Perri. Though George R. R. Martin may have resurrected the dire wolf in our imaginations, the new study also found that the extinct species couldnt interbreed with gray wolves or coyotes they shared the North American plains with. That means their extinction left behind no hybridized offspring that could have passed on traces of dire wolf DNA to living canines. So, sadly, that buff coyote you saw, probably wasnt part dire wolf after all."}, {"title": "Melting Russian Permafrost Yields New Woolly Rhino Specimen", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "December 31, 2020", "doc": "A shockingly well preserved woolly rhinoceros has emerged from the thawing muck of the Russian permafrost, reports Valeria Sukhova for the Siberian Times. Valerii Plotnikov, a mammoth researcher at the Russian Academy of Sciences, tells RTs Jonny Tickle that this may be the best preserved example of the extinct Ice Age mammal ever found. There are soft tissues in the back of the carcass, possibly genitals and part of the intestine, he tells RT. This makes it possible to study the excreta, which will allow us to reconstruct the paleoenvironment of that period. Plotnikov tells local Russian outlet Yakutia 24 that the woolly rhino specimen includes all four limbs, its horn and even some of its woolly coat, according to report from Reuters. The scientist also says wear marks on the horn suggest the creature may have used its bony protrusion to gather food, perhaps scraping away snow to reach tender greenery underneath. Plotnikov tells the Siberian Times that the animal looks to have died young at three or four years of age and likely drowned. The gender of the animal is still unknown, he adds. The prehistoric beast was found in the Yakutia region in August and is thought to have roamed the Arctic plains between 20,000 and 50,000 years ago, Plotnikov tells the Siberian Times. The Associated Press reports that radiocarbon dating tests should deliver a more precise estimate of its age once the ancient carcass reaches a lab. According to the Siberian Times, the ancient remains are stuck in a remote location near the Tirekhtyakh River until ice roads form and they can be transported to a research facility in Yakutias capital city of Yakutsk. After initial study in Yakutsk, the remains will be sent to Sweden for further analysis, per RT. Plotnikov mentions Swedish researcher Love Dalen, a paleogeneticist at Stockholm University and the Swedish Museum of Natural History, as a potential collaborator for unspooling the specimens biological secrets. Its a fantastic find, clearly one of the best preserved woolly rhinos ever discovered, he says. Dalen has previously extracted DNA from other well preserved woolly rhino tissues to help answer questions about their mysterious extinction. This specimen will be very important for our ongoing project to sequence the genomes from multiple rhinos in order to examine the species evolutionary history, he says.

At roughly 47 million years old, the specimens are the oldest python fossils ever found, a discovery which has reconfigured the evolutionary tree of these serpents, reports Katherine Kornei for the New York Times. The new find pushes the origins of pythons back some 20 million years, according to a paper published earlier this month in the journal Biology Letters. The fossils emerged from Germanys Messel Pit, a former shale mine that is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The fossil bed is famous for providing a window into the evolution of early mammals during the Eocene 57 to 36 million years ago. Discovering this early python, named Messelopython freyi, in Europe suggests the serpents may have first evolved in the Northern Hemisphere rather than in the Southern Hemisphere where most of their living relatives are found today, reports Laura Geggel for Live Science. So far, there have been no early fossils that would help decide between a Northern and Southern Hemisphere origin, Krister Smith, a paleontologist at the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt and co author of the paper, tells Live Science via email. Our new fossils are by far the oldest records of pythons, and being in Europe they support an origin in the Northern Hemisphere. To discern the fossils status as a brand new species of python, the researchers compared the four specimens to others from museum collections around the world. The full menagerie included 90 different species of snakes and lizards, and the comparisons involved computerized tomography scans and microscopic examination, per the Times. These comparisons yielded 785 characteristics cataloging the number, arrangement and proportion of vertebrae, teeth and other bones. Messelopython freyi was around 3.2 feet long and had some 275 vertebrae, according to the paper. Apart from highlighting the possibility that pythons first evolved in Europe, the find may also have interesting implications for when and why pythons and their slithering cousins boa constrictors may have diverged. In the modern world, boas and pythons do not naturally occur together anywhere on Earth despite their similar appearances and shared predilection for squeezing the life out of their prey. But back in the Eocene it seems boas and pythons must have competed for the same prey, since the remains of both have been found in the Messel Pit. In Messel, both Messelopython freyi as well as primitive boas such as Eoconstrictor fischeri lived together in the same ecosystemwe therefore have to revisit the thesis that these two groups of snakes competed with each other, making them unable to share the same habitats, says Smith in a statement. The papers co author, paleontologist Hussam Zaher of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, tells Live Science that we may be able to learn more about how these groups of snakes competed with one another by unearthing additional fossils of each in Europe, especially those with preserved stomach contents. Alternatively, Zaher says Florida, where introduced species of pythons and boas have each successfully established themselves, could offer a window into this ancient ecological matchup."}, {"title": "A 57,000-Year-Old Mummified Wolf Pup Was Discovered Frozen in Yukon Permafrost", "author": "Rasha Aridi", "date": "December 23, 2020", "doc": "Four years ago, a gold miner in Canadas Yukon territory was excavating for the precious metal when he used a water cannon to blast through a slab of frozen mud.

The team of scientists could clearly see that Zh\u00f9r was female, and X rays revealed that she was around six or seven weeks old when she died, reports the Times. Plus, geochemical signatures on her teeth revealed that she ate mostly fish and other aquatic critters instead of large mammals like caribou or bison, reports Riley Black for National Geographic. Zh\u00f9r was also in good shape, so she didnt starve to death or get mauled by another predator. Instead, she was likely in her den when it collapsed on her, entombing her in sandy earth, reports Kiona N. Smith for Ars Technica. Despite her life being cut short, Zh\u00f9r has provided a glimpse into what wolves were like thousands of years ago in what is now the Yukon territory. DNA analysis revealed that Zh\u00f9r descends from an ancient wolf population, ancestors of the gray wolves that originated in Siberia, Russia and Alaska, reports CNN. But Zh\u00f9rs population no longer exists in the Yukon area, suggesting that her populationthe first to move into the regionwere wiped out and replaced with another, reports National Geographic. Zh\u00f9r is truly an ancient wolf, and she was related to all the wolves around her at the time, Meachen tells CNN. But the cool thing about that, that most people might not know, is that wolves in the ice age were only distantly related to wolves that are around today. They are still the same species, but they are very different, for being in the same species. Discovering Zh\u00f9r is especially important since there are very few frozen mummies found in North America. There have been other ancient wolf remains found in places like Siberia, but finding a well preserved specimen in Yukon is rare since the ground has to be permanently frozen and the animal must be buried quickly.  As climate change intensifies, scientists are expecting to unearth even more once frozen animals. Melting ice and thawing permafrost have already revealed a colony of mummified penguins, an Ice Age cave bear, ancient cave lion cubs and an extinct baby horse."}, {"title": "The Top Ten Dinosaur Discoveries of 2020", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "December 22, 2020", "doc": "Theres never been a better time to be a dinosaur fan. Even in a year where fossil explorations have been curtailed because of the COVID 19 pandemic, paleontologists have dug deep to describe dozens of new species and unlock new secrets about our favorite prehistoric creatures. The discoveries continue even now, with the fluffy maned dinosaur Ubirajara named just last weekend. As we anticipate what the fossil record might reveal in 2021, heres a look back at ten dinosaur discoveries that surprised and enthralled dinosaur enthusiasts this year. Some of the key traits that allowed dinosaurs to be such an evolutionary success storyfrom fuzzy feathers to warm running metabolismsmay have first evolved in their tiny ancestors. This year experts reported the discovery of a tiny reptile from the Triassic of Madagascar they named Kongonaphon. While not a dinosaur itself, this animal was close to the ancestors of both dinosaurs and related flying reptiles called pterosaurs. This small, insect eating reptile likely moved nimbly to catch lunch and may have sported a coat of fuzz to help regulate its body temperature. This hints that some key dinosaur traits, such as warm bloodedness and insulating body coverings, evolved early in their history and were elaborated upon as dinosaurs eventually diversified into all sorts of shapes and sizes. Paleontologists have long suspected that the giant carnivore Spinosaurus spent much of its time around the water. Fossils reported in 2015 went a step furtherflat feet and dense bones indicated that Spinosaurus spent a great deal of time in the water and is the first known semi aquatic dinosaur. This year, a tail added another clue. The appendage, found at the same quarry as the 2015 skeleton, is long and deep. The tail is more like a paddle than whats seen in other carnivorous dinosaurs and would have been suited to swishy, side to side motions that propelled Spinosaurus through the water. The fact that the tail goes with the other fossils found at the site also confirm that they all go to one individual, underscoring the fact that Spinosaurus had strange body proportions unlike any other dinosaur yet discovered. Dinosaurs are often celebrated for being big, fierce and tough. The truth, however, is that they suffered from many of the same injuries and maladies that humans do. A study published this year in The Lancet reported on the first well documented case of malignant bone cancer in a non avian dinosaur. The animal, a horned dinosaur known to experts as Centrosaurus, probably coped with declining health before its eventual death in a coastal flood that caught its herd off guard. If dinosaurs ruled the Earth for millions of years, why were they hit so hard by the mass extinction of 66 million years ago? Paleontologists have been puzzling over this question for decades, and, some have suggested, dinosaurs might have already been dying back by time the asteroid struck. But an increasing amount of evidence contracts that view, including a study published this year in Royal Society Open Science. The researchers looked at different evolutionary trees for what dinosaurs were around during the end of the Cretaceous to track whether dinosaurs were dying out, thriving or staying the same. After sifting through the data, the paleontologists didnt find any sign that dinosaurs were declining before the asteroid strike. In fact, dinosaurs seemed perfectly capable of evolving new species. If the asteroid had missed, the Age of Dinosaurs would have continued for a very long time. Sometimes dinosaurs show up where we dont expect them. While paleontologists have found numerous fossils of duckbilled dinosaurs at spots around the worldfrom North America to Antarcticano one had ever found one in Africa. That changed this year. In a Cretaceous Research study, paleontologists described a new species of hadrosaur found in Morocco. Named Ajnabia, the dinosaur lived at the end of the Cretaceous during a time when Africa was separated from other continents by deep water channels. Swimming would have been the only way for the dinosaur to reach prehistoric Africa from Europe or Asia, reinforcing the idea that exceptional events can help species move between distant continents. Baby dinosaurs are exceptionally rare. We know far more about the adults of most species than how they started life. And when we do find those babies, they often hold surprises. An embryo of a long necked dinosaur called a titanosaur reported in Current Biology drew attention this year for a strange, rhino like horn jutting from its face. No such structure has been found in adult titanosaurs, and so it seems the horn is a kind of a temporary egg tooth that the dinosaur would have used to crack out of its shell. Think of a dinosaur egg and youre likely to envision something out of Jurassic Parka hard shelled capsule the baby dinosaur has to kick or push its way out of. But research published this year in Nature proposes that many dinosaurs laid soft shelled eggs. Under close examination, the eggs of the dinosaurs Protoceratops and Mussaurus turned out to be more like the leathery eggs of turtles than the thick, hard shelled eggs known from other dinosaurs. This may indicate that dinosaur eggs started off soft and only later evolved to be hard shelled in some groups. The findings may often indicate why eggs have been so hard to find for many dinosaur species, as softer eggs would decay more readily than hard shelled ones. Not all this years big dinosaur discoveries had to do with non avian dinosaurs. A fossil dubbed the wonderchicken in Nature has helped paleontologists understand how modern birds took off during the Age of Dinosaurs. While birds go back to about 150 million years ago, the wonderchickenor Asteriornislived about 67 million years ago and is the oldest known representative of what biologists think of as modern birds. The fossil, which includes a skull, has some anatomical similarities to chickens and ducks. These findings indicate that modern birds started to evolve and proliferate prior to the mass extinction that wiped out the non avian dinosaurs. If such beaked, seed eating birds had not evolved, dinosaurs might have been entirely wiped out instead of leaving birds behind. Will DNA from the likes of Tyrannosaurus ever be found? The consensus has been No, as DNA decays too fast after death to survive millions and millions of years. But in a study published in National Science Review this year, researchers have proposed that theyve found chemical signatures consistent with DNA in the bones of a 70 million year old hadrosaur called Hypacrosaurus. The results have yet to be expanded upon or verified, but the idea that even degraded DNA from non avian dinosaurs might survive is tantalizing for all such a discovery might teach us about prehistoric life. Ever since paleontologists discovered dinosaur bones within the ancient Arctic Circle, experts have debated whether the polar dinosaurs stayed in their cool habitats year round or migrated with the seasons. A tiny jaw from a young dinosaur now answers that question. Described in PLOS ONE, the fossil belonged to a young raptor like dinosaur that lived in an ancient Alaskan habitat marked by harsh seasonal shifts and long, dark winters. That dinosaurs were nesting and hatching babies in these habitats indicates that they were capable of surviving the harsh winters, even when it snowed."}, {"title": "With a Mane and Strange Shoulder Rods, This New Dinosaur Was Quite a \u2018Little Show-Off\u2019", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "December 17, 2020", "doc": "A new species of dinosaur discovered by paleontologists in Brazil may not sound like much, fossils suggest it was a meat eater about the size of a chicken, but its paltry stature may have belied an abundance of swagger. X ray scans of the fossil revealed a halo of fanciful protrusions surrounding its bones that researchers say may have featured in gaudy mating displays rivaling modern peacocks and birds of paradise, reports Will Dunham for Reuters. Writing in the journal Cretaceous Research, the researchers describe adornments including a mane of potentially colorful proto feathers running down its neck and back, and, strangest of all, two stiff, ribbon like structures jutting nearly six inches out of each shoulder, reports Karina Shah for New Scientist. These shoulder structures are really elaborate they made this animal look pretty spectacular, just as a bird of paradise looks spectacular today, David Martill, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth and co author of the new study, tells John Pickrell of Science News. When birds have these sorts of feathers, they do all sorts of posh dances and displays, so this dinosaur looks like it was a little show off. Researchers found the new species in the limestone of the Crato Formation in northeastern Brazil. They named it Ubirajara jubatus, which derives from a local Indigenous word in the Tupi language meaning lord of the spear, and jubatis which comes from the Latin word for maned or crested, per Science News. Ubirajara jubatus lived during the Cretaceous, roughly 110 million years ago, and while its remains turned up in todays Brazil, the creatures native continent in life would have been super sized Gondwanaa tectonic mash up of South America, Africa, India, Antarctica and Australia, per New Scientist. This showy dinosaurs mane and shoulder decorations were discovered by researchers taking a second look at a decades old fossil using high resolution digital X rays, reports George Dvorsky for Gizmodo. Researchers say both the mane and the shoulder ribbons were made of the protein keratin, which also makes up hair, fingernails and bird feathers. The ribbon like structures are unlike anything weve seen before. Theyre elongate and flat with a ridge running along their length that likely strengthened the structures, Robert Smyth, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth and the papers first author, tells Gizmodo. Similar shaped filaments are known in other dinosaurs, but none that are so large in comparison to the size of the animal. The mane was composed of slender filaments reaching four inches long in places, according to New Scientist. Likely from a distance it looked hairy rather than feathery, Martill tells Reuters. Likely it had hair like protofeathers over much of its body but they are only preserved along its neck, back and arms. The ones on its back are very long and give it a sort of mane that is unique for dinosaurs. Martill adds that he thinks this may well have been quite a colorful, too. According to Science News, this specimen is the first direct evidence of a dinosaur with feather like structures found in the Southern Hemisphere and suggests the use of feathers in display may have ancient evolutionary roots within a group of carnivorous dinosaurs called the compsognathids. Speaking with Science News, Max Langer, a paleontologist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo who was not involved in the research, notes that its unfortunate the fossil ended up in Germany instead of Brazil and that its subsequent analysis occurred without the involvement of Brazilian researchers. Science News reports that Martill and another of the papers authors acquired the fossil from the paleontological museum in the Brazilian city of Crato with permission from local officials and brought it to Germany in 1995 where it has been ever since."}, {"title": "Amateur Fossil Hunter Discovers New \u2018Sea Dragon\u2019 Species on British Beach", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "December 16, 2020", "doc": "An amateur fossil hunter scouring an English beach discovered a new species of bug eyed, barrel chested marine reptile that patrolled the areas prehistoric seas roughly 150 million years ago, reports Christa Leste Lasserre for New Scientist. When Steve Etches started to extract what he soon recognized as an ichthyosaur fossil from a white band of coastal limestone near Kimmeridge Bay in Dorset, he thought the teeth looked unusual. Unsure of exactly what hed dug up, Etches sent the mineralized bones off to paleontologists at the University of Portsmouth for a closer look, reports Jack Guy for CNN. Ichthyosaurs were sleek, dolphin like reptilian predators with sharp teeth for snagging fish, squid and other prey. After years of examination, the researchers determined this particular specimen was not just a new species, but that it was different enough from other known ichthyosaurs that it merited the creation of a new genus. In a new paper published in the journal PLOS One, the researchers dubbed the creature Thalassodraco etchesi. Its name derives from Thalasso, the word for sea in Greek, draco, the Latin word for dragon, and etchesi in honor of Etches discovery, according to New Scientist. Im very pleased that this ichthyosaur has been found to be new to science, and Im very honoured for it to be named after me, Etches, a plumber by trade, tells Sara Rigby of PA Media. Its excellent that new species of ichthyosaurs are still being discoveredwhich shows just how diverse these incredible animals were in the Late Jurassic seas. Researchers estimate that the Etches sea dragon measured about 6 feet from nose to tail, and had anatomical features that suggest it may have been a deep diving specialist. This animal was obviously doing something different compared to other ichthyosaurs. One idea is that it could be a deep diving species, like sperm whales, says Megan L. Jacobs, a paleontologist at Baylor University and co author of the new paper, in a statement. The extremely deep rib cage may have allowed for larger lungs for holding their breath for extended periods, or it may mean that the internal organs werent crushed under the pressure. It also has incredibly large eyes, which means it could see well in low light. That could mean it was diving deep down, where there was no light, or it may have been nocturnal. Thalassodraco etchesi is also unusually small for an ichthyosaur, some of which have skulls longer than Thalassodracos entire body, per CNN. Now that its been properly described by paleontologists, the fossil will go on display at Etches collection museum in Dorset, which is home to the fossil enthusiasts numerous other finds."}, {"title": "Study Reveals Humble Origins of Flying Pterosaurs ", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "December 15, 2020", "doc": "When dinosaurs roamed the Earth, flying reptiles known as pterosaurs ruled the skies. These leathery winged flyers reached enormous size, with some species unfurling wings that spanned 30 feet across or more. The first pterosaurs appeared around 220 million years ago and disappeared from the planet along with the dinosaurs 66 million years ago during the Cretaceous Paleogene mass extinction. For 200 years, researchers have been unable to trace the evolutionary path this group of reptiles took to get airborne. Now, newly described fossils may clarify the evolutionary origins of the first vertebrates to develop powered flight, reports Riley Black for Scientific American. The new research, published last week in the journal Nature, analyzes fossils from North America, Brazil, Argentina and Madagascar and comes to the conclusion that pterosaurs evolved from a group of small Triassic reptiles called the lagerpetids, reports George Dvorsky for Gizmodo. Lagerpetids were small, insectivorous and possibly bipedal reptiles that lived between 201 and 237 million years ago, reports Will Dunham for Reuters. Recent research has suggested these delicately built reptiles might also be ancestors of the first dinosaurs, which appeared around 233 million years ago. Researchers studied existing lagerpetid fossils as well as newly unearthed specimens using high resolution scans and 3 D modeling. The analyses yielded 33 skeletal features that made the case for an evolutionary through line between lagerpetids and pterosaurs, per Reuters. Lagerpetids would have the basic body form and skull anatomy of what we think was the common ancestor of pterosaurs and lagerpetids, Sterling Nesbitt, a paleontologist at Virginia Tech and co author of the paper, tells Scientific American. Llagerpetids are essentially flightless pterosaurs. As Laura Geggel of Live Science points out, this means the lagerpetids didnt lead directly to the pterosaurs. Instead, their shared skeletal features, such as the shape of the inner ear, braincase, teeth, hand, leg, ankle and pelvic bones, suggest the two groups shared a relatively recent common ancestor. In particular, the inner ear and braincase anatomy of lagerpetids hinted at adaptations that have been linked to the pterosaurs development of flight. The presence in lagerpetids of neuroanatomical features that were previously linked to the origin of flight in pterosaurs indicates that they instead appeared before the acquisition of flight and were exploited later by pterosaurs, allowing them to conquer the skies, Mart\u00edn Ezcurra, co author of the paper and a paleontologist at the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Argentine Museum and the University of Birmingham, tells Scientific American. But, for all their similarities, the lagerpetdids show no anatomical signs of taking to the skies themselves. We are still missing lots of information about the earliest pterosaurs, and we still dont know how their skeletons transformed into an animal that was capable of flight, says Nesbitt in a statement. Though the moment of transition between land dwelling and flying vertebrates remains shrouded by the stone encasing fossils yet to be discovered, if the new findings are confirmed they shrink the gap between the oldest pterosaurs and their closest relatives."}, {"title": "How Dinosaurs Thrived in the Snow", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "December 3, 2020", "doc": "Imagine a tyrannosaur striding through the snow, leaving three toed footprints in the powder as flurries fall on the fuzz along the dinosaurs back. The vision might seem fit for fantasy, vastly different than the steamy and plant choked settings we typically think of dinosaurs inhabiting. Yet such scenes truly transpired millions of years ago, with an entire spiky, feathery and beaked menagerie of dinosaurs thriving in polar habitats marked by greater swings between the seasons and prolonged winter darkness. The finds are coming fast and furious. A tiny jaw found in Alaskas ancient rock record, and written about in July, indicates that dinosaurs nested in these places and stayed year round. In 2018, paleontologists published a study describing how microscopic details of polar dinosaur bones show that some dinosaurs slowed their growth during harsh seasons to get by with less. The ongoing identification of new species, not found anywhere else, highlighted how some dinosaurs adapted to the cold. Each thread comes together to underscore how wonderfully flexible dinosaur species were, adapting to some of the harshest habitats of their time. Understanding when and where polar dinosaurs roamed takes a little geological imagination. Earths continents are always shifting, so the climates where fossils are found were once different. The environments recorded in the strata of southern Australia, for example, were further south and within the Antarctic Circle when dinosaurs thrived there in the Cretaceous. But in reconstructing the tectonic jigsaw and tracking where fossils have been uncovered, paleontologists have found dinosaurs that lived near both the northern and southern poles at different times. Some of the oldest polar dinosaurs are found among the rocks of southern Australias aptly named Dinosaur Cove. Over 110 million years ago, says Monash University paleontologist Patricia Rich, this area was a temperate rainforest carpeted with ferns and bushy looking conifers called podocarps. And while the Cretaceous world was a bit warmer, with no polar icecaps, winter could still be harsh. There would have been ice and snow in the three month long, dark winters, Rich says. Still, a variety of dinosaurs thrived here, including small, feathery predators, parrot like oviraptors and Leaellynasaura, a small herbivore that walked on two legs and had one of the longest tails for its body size of any dinosaur. Some dinosaurs might have dug in to survive the harshest months. Paleontologists working in southern Australias strata have found burrow like structures from the age of Leaellynasaura, and elsewhere these structures actually contain small, herbivorous dinosaurs. Its possible that dinosaurs might have burrowed as a way to escape the cold, says paleontologist Adele Pentland  of the Australian Age of Dinosaurs Museum of Natural History. The clearest evidence we have of polar adaptations, or not, is the composition of the fauna, adds Monash University paleontologist Steve Poropat. Which types of dinosaurs are found in cooler places, as opposed to those that are missing, offers some insights into which dinosaurs were better able to cope with or adapt to the long polar nights. Theropods, ornithopods, ankylosaurs? No problem. You find them at heaps of sites throughout Victoria, Poropat notes, referencing the state in southeastern Australia. These types of dinosaurs could withstand the cold and dark months. But long necked, plant eating dinosaurs called sauropods that lived at the same time are missing from the same sites, which suggests that they were not able to survive or adapt to the colder environments. The Antarctic Circle wasnt the only place to host chill adapted dinosaurs. The 70 million year old rock of Alaskas Prince Creek Formation contains the fossils of horned dinosaurs, tyrannosaurs, duckbilled dinosaurs, raptors and more that lived within the Arctic Circle. And when these dinosaurs began to catch researchers attention during the 1980s, they presented some challenges to what paleontologists thought about dinosaur lives. When dinosaurs were first found in the Arctic, they presented some serious problems to our understanding of dinosaurian physiology, Perot Museum of Nature and Science paleontologist Tony Fiorillo says. Even as paleontologists considered that dinosaurs might keep warmer body temperatures, the harshness of the Arctic cold was thought to be too much. Some experts proposed that dinosaurs might migrate, drawing an analogy to modern day caribou, which dont migrate long distances north and south, Fiorillo says. Various lines of evidence indicate that the dinosaurs remained in their home habitat through the winter. Just this past year, Fiorillo and colleagues were the ones who published on a jaw from a very young raptorevidence that dinosaurs were nesting in the region and not just passing through. The landscape would have looked a little familiar. At the time the Prince Creek Formation was being laid down, Fiorillo says, the area was similar to what its like todaya coastal plain dominated by stands of conifers and flowering plants low to the ground. And while overall warmer than the same spot today, it still got cold enough to snow during the winters. Alaskas dinosaurs had to contend with some of the same stresses as their southern counterpartssuch as harsher changes in seasons and months of darknessbut evidence from their bones indicate that these dinosaurs stayed year round. Much like their relatives elsewhere, polar dinosaurs grew fast when they were young but switched to more of a stop and start growth pattern as they got older. This means that polar dinosaurs were already biologically predisposed to surviving on less during the cold months, with the dinosaurs growing faster again during the lush summers. While certainly chilly during the winter, the ground did not freeze in these places, providing enough vegetation to support an ecosystem of resident dinosaurs. There may have been no one way that dinosaurs adjusted to the comparative harshness of life near the pole. The local tyrannosaur in the Prince Creek Formation was not a familiar species seen elsewhere, but a unique and smaller predatorroughly the size of a polar bear that Fiorillo and colleagues dubbed Nanuqsaurus. The comparatively small stature of this dinosaur, as well as the downsized species of horned dinosaur called Pachyrhinosaurus in the area, hints that types of dinosaurs that grew big elsewhere adapted to become smaller and thereby get by on less food in the cool of ancient Alaska. But some polar dinosaurs truly thrived. The raptor relative Troodon was a feathery, eight foot long dinosaur with large eyes. While rare elsewhere, Fiorillo says, it is the overwhelmingly abundant theropod dinosaur. The small carnivores large eyes may have given it an advantage, especially during the dark months. Our visions of polar dinosaurs are still relatively new. Determining which species lived in cooler areas is part of that task. Some, like Nanuqsaurus which was named in 2014, are new. Others turn out to be familiara duckbill dinosaur previously thought to be a new species has turned out to be Edmontosaurus, a wide ranging hadrosaur found elsewhere. For me, Fiorillo says, the story is even more fascinating knowing that some Arctic dinosaurs became specialists within the ancient north while others were generalists capable of surviving a wide array of environmental conditions. Many finds are left to be made, not just among the dinosaurs but about the big picture of the habitats where they lived. Discoveries are being made every day, Rich says, noting that fieldwork just this year in the time of Leaellynasaura has uncovered dinosaur tracks, turtle shells, tree trunks with termite damage and more, all parts of a lost polar world. Finds like these will continue to highlight just how successful dinosaurs were, a testament to their prehistoric versatility. In virtually any ancient landscape, dinosaurs found a way."}, {"title": "The Mystery of the \u2018Dueling Dinosaurs\u2019 May Finally Be Solved Now That They\u2019ve Found a Home", "author": "Rasha Aridi", "date": "November 19, 2020", "doc": "In 2006, fossil hunters unearthed the bones of a Tyrannosaurus rex and a Triceratops entangled in a giant 67 million year old fossil, prompting paleontologists to wonder how in the world these Dueling Dinosaurs ended up buried together. Scientists havent been able to get their hands on the fossils yet, as the bones have been shut away in labs and warehouses after years of court battles, auctions and negotiations. But now, the sparring dinosaurs are going to be studied and exhibited at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh after the nonprofit Friends of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences bought them and donated them to the museum, reports Michael Greshko for National Geographic. Fourteen years ago, Clayton Phipps and his team of commercial fossil hunters discovered a Triceratops pelvis jutting out of a hillside on a private farm in Montana. Curious, the team dug out the whole skeleton with the approval of the landowner and revealed a near perfectly preserved Triceratops intertwined with a T. rex, reports Laura Geggel for Live Science. The Dueling Dinosaurs is one of the most remarkable fossil discoveries ever made, Scott Sampson, a paleontologist and the president of Science World, a nonprofit education and research facility in Vancouver, told Smithsonian in 2017. It is the closest thing I have ever seen to large scale fighting dinosaurs. If it is what we think it is, its ancient behavior caught in the fossil record. Weve been digging for over 100 years in the Americas, and no ones found a specimen quite like this one. Aware of his once in a lifetime discovery, Phipps called up every American museum or institution, hoping to sell the fossil to them, he told Smithsonian. But nobody would even send an expert out to look at it, he claimed. Unable to sell the fossil to a museum, Phipps turned to the private sector and tried to auction off the fossil. The highest bid was for 5.5 million, despite it being appraised for around 9 million. Displeased with the price, Phipps locked the fossil up in storage. In 2016, Phipps was contacted by Lindsay Zanno, a paleontologist at North Carolina State University and the head of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, who asked him about selling the fossils to the museum and scheduled a visit to the warehouse. You cannot look at these specimens without almost seeing them walk out of the block and walk right by you, Zanno told National Geographic. You can just see them as they were in life. But before the Dueling Dinosaurs could finally make it to their new home, the owners of the farm, Mary Anne and Lige Murray, were tied up in a legal battle with the farms previous owners, brothers Jerry and Robert Severson, over who really owned the fossil, reports Live Science. The Seversons retained two thirds of the lands mineral rights after selling the land to the Murrays and claimed that fossils were minerals. In that were true, they could cash the profits from the sales. Finally, after years of arduous court battles, the Montana Supreme Court ruled that fossils werent minerals, and the Murrays won their case in May 2020. Commercial bidding wars over dinosaur bones are highly controversial in the scientific community, with many paleontologists considering the practice unethical. Recently, a T. Rex nicknamed Stan was sold for 31.8 million to an unknown buyer. Some scientists, like Tyrannosaur expert Thomas Carr, a paleontologist at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wisconsin, see the purchase of the Dueling Dinosaurs by a museum from a private seller as condoning the unethical trade in irreplaceable fossils, reports National Geographic. Its good that those specimens made it into a real museum and havent disappeared like Stan did, but on the other hand, what was the price tag? Carr says. That sale opens up the issue of whether or not scientists and museums have become handmaidens for the commercial fossil trade. Now that the dinosaurs are en route to the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, theyll finally be available for scientists to examine, and the public can engage with an exhibition built around the T. rex and Triceratops, according to a press release. Its going to be a very iconic specimen, paleontologist Kirk Johnson, director of the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History, tells National Geographic. The bones are still partially encased in rock, where scientists can study impressions left behind by the dinos skin. Its possible that trace amounts of proteins from the dinosaurs themselves may one day be extracted from the rock as technology improves. Its going to be a very intricate job to expose the bones and not destroy the skin while doing that, Johnson says. Plus, paleontologists may finally be able figure out how a pair of foes ended up spending eternity interlocked in mortal combat. Maybe they both died fighting, or perhaps their bodies were just randomly entombed next to each other, reports Live Science. We have not yet studied this specimen it is a scientific frontier, Zanno says in the press release. The preservation is phenomenal, and we plan to use every technological innovation available to reveal new information on the biology of T. rex and Triceratops. This fossil will forever change our view of the worlds two favorite dinosaurs."}, {"title": "First Evidence of Parasites in Dinosaur Bones Found", "author": "Jill Langlois", "date": "November 18, 2020", "doc": "Aline, could this be a microfossil? The question popped up on Aline Ghilardis phone via a text from her husband, fellow paleontologist Tito Aureliano, while she was studying for a test that would make her a professor at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte in Brazil. It was 2018, and Aureliano was examining the fossilized leg bone of a small dinosaur from the titanosaur family discovered by Ghilardi 12 years earlier. An expert in fossilized dinosaur tissue, Aureliano had been tasked with looking more closely at the spongey lumps on the bones surface. The pair of paleontologists had already made a fascinating discoverythat the dinosaur, which lived more than 80 million years ago during the Cretaceous period, had an acute bone infection called osteomyelitis. But Aureliano prepared thin slices of the fossilized bone to allow for a more detailed study of the infection, which still affects animals and humans today. What he found when he looked through his microscope were microfossils, fossilized microorganisms generally less than a millimeter in size. Although microfossils can be plants or animals, this time they were parasites. The discovery left him so shocked that he knew he had to send a photo of the discovery to his wife right away. When I looked at the photo my chin dropped all the way to the ground, says Ghilardi. I said, Tito, nobody has ever found anything like this before. I dont even know what to do. I dont even know what to say. We need to call in more people. The team of experts they assembled confirmed what Aureliano suspected There were microfossils in the bone. The discovery was exceptional it was indeed the first time fossilized parasites had been found in a dinosaur bone. The paleontologists published their findings in Cretaceous Research in October. Both the dinosaura small, long necked titanosaur sauropod about sixteen feet from nose to tailand the 70 blood parasites found within the vascular channels of its bone are newly discovered species that have yet to be named or described. Ghilardi had unearthed the bone in 2006 at a dig site in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, and as soon as she saw the lesions on its surface, she knew she wanted to investigate further. None of the other fossils found there had this type of damage, and initially she thought it might have been caused by one of the forms of bone cancer being investigated by other paleontologists. Usually, pre historic illnesses are diagnosed in fossils by the naked eye or simple x rays. The high costs of using microscopic equipment like CT scans puts the more detailed picture they would provide out of reach for most research teams. Thats why Ghilardi and Aureliano turned to colleagues at the University of S\u00e3o Paulos School of Medicine for help. There, they were able to do a CT scan of the bone. It was the first time a 3 D model had ever been created of a fossil with this type of pathology. With the image, the researchers were able to diagnose the mystery lesions not as cancer, but as osteomyelitis. They could also see that the infection extended from deep within the bone all the way to its surface, likely causing the elderly dinosaur a lot of pain and creating inflammation on its bones and open sores on its skin. Due to the gruesome nature of the injuries, the team nicknamed the creature Zombie Dino. As they prepared their article, Ghilardi and Aureliano noticed a lack of histological data on osteomyelitis, even in research related to modern medicine. The infection is most commonly caused by severe trauma where both the bone and the skin break, allowing bacteria to enter the bone more easily. Osteomyelitis is a frequent concern during orthopedic surgery on humans. We saw in the scientific literature that this decision to extract tissue samples had only been done with one dinosaur before, says Aureliano. And we also saw that there was a really big demand in the world of science to understand how this osteomyelitis happens. So, we wanted to know how, at the microscopic level, the tissue was being remodeled because of the infection. Aureliano thought preparing thin tissue samples could help others further study osteomyelitis for purposes beyond just paleontology. The bodys mechanisms of defense are still not 100 percent understood, says Marcus Vin\u00edcius Guimar\u00e3es de Lacerda, an infectologist at the Dr. Heitor Vieira Dourado Tropical Medicine Foundation who was not involved in the research. This study could help us understand the inflammations mechanisms over time and how these mechanisms evolved. It was when they cut into the fossil to prepare the samples that Aureliano and colleague Fresia Ricardi Branco, a geologist and professor of paleontology at Campinas State University in Brazil, saw the microfossils, originally a set of ten, for the first time. Stunned, they then called on paleoparasitologist Carolina Nascimento, of S\u00e3o Carlos Federal University, to take a closer look. Nascimento was able to identify dozens more, over 70 in total, of the preserved microorganisms, which ended up being blood parasites. Before that moment, fossilized parasites had only ever been found in amber or fossilized feces. But one thing the team has yet to figure out is whether the parasites caused the osteomyelitis, or whether the infection created an ideal environment that allowed the parasites to take advantage of the dinosaur, enter its bones and thrive. With no signs of a break or a bite in the bone, the researchers have been left stumped as to how the infection started. Now, Ghilardi and Nascimento are looking more closely at the parasites to try to find answers. They know the only reason they were able to understand the discoveries they already made was teamwork across paleontological specialties, including pathology, histology and parasitology. They hope continuing to work together will lead to results that show their research can help with the advancement of other areas, like medicine, too. Understanding the evolutionary paths of disease Ghilardi says, is crucial, particularly when it involves parasites. Knowing how osteomyelitis affected pre historic animals, like dinosaurs, and how it changed before infecting animals and humans today, could be the key to finding a way to combat it now. It could give us a clue, she says, as to where to look for a cure."}, {"title": "Newly Unearthed Skull Reveals How Ancient Hominids Evolved to Survive a Changing Climate", "author": "Rasha Aridi", "date": "November 13, 2020", "doc": "Two years ago, a team of researchers excavated the earliest and best preserved specimen of Paranthropus robustusour ancient cousins with jutting cheekbones, large teeth and small brains that lived from 1.2 to 2 million years agoon an archaeological dig in South Africas Cradle of Humankind. With it, the team also unearthed the most compelling evidence that species in the human family tree were able to evolve in response to quick changes in the climate, reports Nicholas St. Fleur for the New York Times. The two million year old skull, labeled DNH 155, belonged to a male from the Drimolen cave system. Compared to other P. robustus males recovered from a nearby cave system called Swartkrans, DNH 155 was much smaller and had more female like characteristics, according to a study published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution. Archaeologists had originally believed that for the most part, female P. robustus were smaller, less burly and lived in Drimolen males, which were heavier built, lived in Swartkrans, reports Peter Dockrill for Science Alert. Now, that didnt seem right to me, Angeline Leece, a paleoanthropologist at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, tells the Times. What it looked like to me instead is that we have males and females in Drimolen, and males and females at Swartkrans, but the Drimolen ones were just overall smaller. But there was a 200,000 year difference between when P. robustus occupied the Drimolen caves and then Swartkrans. Around that timeabout two million years agothe region underwent a dramatic change in climate. The lush, green grasslands transformed into drier and cooler fields, altering the ecosystems vegetation and the plants available for P. robustus to feast on, a press release says. The plants became tougher and harder to chew, so DNH 155 and other P. robustus wouldnt have been able to munch on them. As time went on, natural selection favored individuals with stronger chewing muscles and tougher teeth, so they passed those traits down to their offspring. Then, some 200,00 years worth of evolution later, P. robustus ended up with sturdier jaws. The variation between the P. robustus specimens found in Drimolen vs. Swartkrans wasnt due to physical differences between males and females, as originally thought, Jesse Martin, a doctoral student on the project, tells the Times. Instead, it was a result of environmental pressures that forced the species to evolve massive chewing and grinding machines to survive. The Drimolen fossils represent the earliest known, very first step in the long evolutionary story of Paranthropus robustus, Martin says in another press release. This find is the first evidence of microevolutionthe changes within a population of one species over timein early hominids, reports the Australian Associated Press. Like all other creatures on earth, our ancestors adapted and evolved in accordance with the landscape and environment around them, Andy Herries, a paleoanthropologist at La Trobe University, says in the press release. For the first time in South Africa, we have the dating resolution and morphological evidence that allows us to see such changes in an ancient hominin lineage through a short window of time. In addition to helping archaeologists piece together the evolution of our ancient ancestors, this discovery also serves as a warning for other scientists to not immediately jump to the conclusion that every odd looking specimen is a new species. Instead, the specimen could be from a known species, just in a different time or place."}, {"title": "New Prehistoric Marine Reptile Resembled a Miniature Mix of Loch Ness Monster, Alligator and Toothy T. Rex", "author": "Rasha Aridi", "date": "November 6, 2020", "doc": "About 240 million years ago, massive oceanic reptiles called nothosaurs dominated the seas. They looked like the mutant offspring of a trihybrid cross between the Loch Ness monster, an alligator and a T. rex. The beasts had long tails to slither underwater, jaws packed with razor sharp teeth and flipper like limbs to propel themselves through the water. When a team of paleontologists from the Chinese Academy of Scientists and Canadian Museum of Nature discovered two small, similar fossils in quarries in southwest China, the scientists originally thought they belonged to juvenile nothosaurs. Further analysis revealed that they actually discovered a new speciesthe nothosaurs smaller, stockier cousin. The teams findings were published last week in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, reports Science News Aayushi Pratap. The team named the newly unearthed reptile Brevicaudosaurus jiyangshanensis, which roughly means short tailed lizard of Jiyangshan, the quarry it was found in, according to the press release. Large nothosaurs could exceed 16 feet in length, but scientists estimate that B. jiyangshanensis adults only reached about 1.5 to 2 feet. The fossils also had rounder, more well defined bones, indicative of an adult, reports Science News. Compared to bigger nothosaurs, this species had a shorter, flatter tail and denser bones. A long tail can be used to flick through the water, generating thrust, but the new species weve identified was probably better suited to hanging out near the bottom in shallow sea, using its short, flattened tail for balance, like an underwater float, allowing it to preserve energy while searching for prey, Qing Hua Shang, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, says in the press release. The anatomy of the fossils helped scientists zero in on how B. jiyangshanensis likely behaved. It had dense bones, which helped it stay neutrally buoyant in the water column, and a broad tail to stay balanced. Plus, an expanded rib cage suggests that the reptile also had large lungs, allowing them to stay underwater for longer, reports Science Focus. Because it was shorter and stockier, it certainly wasnt as agile as its larger, leaner cousin. But instead of speed, B. jiyangshanensis could likely walk on the seabed in search of slow moving critters to feast on. This is the first discovery of a small sized species of a big sized group, Xiao Chun Wu, a paleobiologist at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, Canada, tells Science News. This is a very new lifestyle we now know about nothosaurs."}, {"title": "Scientists Find the World\u2019s Oldest Chameleon-Like Tongue Preserved in Amber", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "November 5, 2020", "doc": "No creature alive today is quite like an albanerpetontid. Cousins of frogs and salamanders, these extinct amphibians have often confounded paleontologists by having scales and claws that make them look like reptiles. And albies, as some researchers call them, just got stranger. Preserved in 99 million year old amber is an albie skull with the worlds oldest known slingshot tongue. The discovery, described today in Science, comes from a literal window into the ancient past. Fossilization in amberor hardened tree sapoften preserves details that might otherwise rot away. The amber deposits of Myanmar, in particular, contain a vast array of Cretaceous creatures that lived in a 99 million year old forest, among them albanerpetontids. Three different fossils indicate that albies were not creatures that lived low to the ground, as previous fossils indicated, but crawled through the trees and nabbed insects with sticky tongues that could shoot out like projectiles. Until now, precisely what albies are and how they lived has been clouded by a spotty fossil record. The oldest fossils of the group are over 165 million years old and the most recent are about 2 million years old, giving albies a range from the middle of the Jurassic through the beginning of the Ice Age. And based on fragmentary fossils, researchers thought that albies spent a lot of their time burrowing into the ground and looked like armored salamanders about four inches long. Unlike living amphibians, says Sam Houston State University paleontologist Juan Diego Daza, lead author of the study, they have their bodies covered by epidermal scales and have keratinized claws. How these animals lived has been difficult to determine. With rare exception, albanerpetontids are recovered as tiny, isolated and disarticulated bones, says Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History paleontologist David DeMar, who was not involved with the new study. Without more complete material, scientists have had a difficult time telling what the entire animals would have looked like and how they would have behaved. The fossils in amber are the clearest look at these mystery animals yet. The key fossil is a complete skull from an adult albie preserved in the resin. All of us were astonished when we saw this fossil for the first time, Daza says. The skull isnt crumpled or smushed, but preserved in three dimensions with parts of the soft tissue intact. The specimen provided the first evidence of parts of the skull that were unknown from previous specimens, says University College London paleontologist Susan Evans, a coauthor on the new study, indicating how the skull had key similarities to some reptiles. In fact, one of the fossils was originally misidentified as an early chameleon. Taken together, the various traits of the fossil indicate that the albies in amber is a new species. Daza, Evans and colleagues named it Yaksha perettii. But best of all, Evans says, the adult skull also preserves parts of the tongue and jaw muscles. These specimens are the next best thing to being able to travel back in time to study a living albanerpetontid, says Royal Tyrrell Museum paleontologist James Gardner, who was not involved with the new study. Even a single, well preserved fossil can rewrite what paleontologists previously thought, and that seems to be the case here. As someone whose work over the past quarter century on albanerpetontids has largely focused on isolated bones, Gardner says, I was both excited and humbled to see what a pristine skull really looked like. Seeing the bones and bits of flesh in context, the researchers were able to determine that Yaksha had the oldest known slingshot tongue. In addition to those soft tissue leftovers, the amphibian also preserves a long, thing bone called the entoglossal process that resembles the same bone in chameleons. The bone is important for shooting the tongue out to grab insects at a speed of over 1,600 feet per second, creating a natural elastic effect that can shoot the tongue out fast and then retract captured prey back to the mouth. Daza, Evans and colleagues propose that all albies lived in a similar way. The claws, forward facing eyes and other skeletal details of related species indicate that these animals were more like chameleons in habit than toads. In external appearance, the researchers write in the new paper, albanerpetontids probably resembled tiny lizards more than salamanders. The idea of albanerpetontids as chameleon like, tree dwelling, sit and wait predators is certainly a novel and exciting hypothesis, DeMar says. Thanks to a small set of fossils, these amphibians have moved from the ground to the trees. And while albies may remain rare, the Yaksha fossils will act as a keystone to compare future finds against. The authors make a convincing case, adds Gardner. Now that the Myanmar fossils have offered a better look at albanerpetontids, for instance, the rod like bones seen in previously discovered fossils in Spain and Italy indicate similar, ballistic tongued abilities. The question, Gardner says, is when albies evolved these traits, which will come into focus with new finds and reanalysis of previously discovered fossils. These amber fossils are not without controversy. Insects, lizards, birds, parts of dinosaurs and other remnants of prehistoric life often fetch high prices from collectors, to the tune of millions of dollars every year. The Myanmar state of Kachin, where the amber comes from, has experienced much bloodshed between the government run military and resistance forces over who controls the amber. The fossils are often gathered under unfair and dangerous working conditions before being smuggled out of country for sale, often with little information about how they were collected or who profits from their sale. The ethical debate around these fossils was brought to the fore earlier this year when a supposed bird in Myanmar amber not only turned out to be a misidentified lizard, but had no documentation of ethical collection practices. Myanmar amber that makes it to market often lacks the necessary information to know how the pieces were collected and transported, and some paleontologists have been increasingly vocal that such undocumented finds should not be purchased or published on if scientists arent sure about whether they may have fueled conflict. But routes exist for the careful and ethical collection of these fossils. Guidelines set by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology note that researchers should follow rigorous standards of due diligence to their supply chains, and supply chains must be clearly documented to ensure that products are not derived from the Myanmar military. Scientists should record not just the identity of the fossil, but where it came from, when it was collected, who transported it to the marketplace, how the fossil was exported and where the fossil will remain for future studies. The authors of the new study state that they worked with these guidelines to make sure the albies did not add profit to the bloodshed in Myanmar. In the case of the amber enclosed albies, the fossils will provide context for how the enigmatic amphibians lived for years to come. These specimens and CT scans will provide a continuing wealth of anatomical information for future studies, DeMar says."}, {"title": "Scientists Reveal What May Be the Largest Flying Bird Ever", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "October 26, 2020", "doc": "Imagine an albatross with a hacksaw for a mouth. Set that strange creature about 50 million years in the past and youve got the image of a pelagornithid, a group of ancient avians that included some of the largest flying birds of all time. And now paleontologists have uncovered in that group what may be the largest known flying birds ever, with wingspans of roughly 20 feet. The new study documenting the birds, published today in Scientific Reports, is the result of a fossil detective story spanning from Antarctica to California. By comparing a pair of polar fossils to the remains of related birds, paleontologists have been able to identify the early history of enormous fliers that were some of the first birds capable of soaring across seas. During the 1980s, University of California Berkeley paleontologist Peter Kloess says, scientists searching for Antarctic fossils found some delicate bird bonesa jaw and part of a foot from an ancient birdon Seymour Island. Those bones then made a long journey to California, but their story was only just starting. The jaw and foot bone were just two of a huge collection kept at the University of California Riverside. In 2003, however, the more than 10,000 fossils of the Riverside collection were transferred to the University of California Museum of Paleontology at the Berkeley campus, the bird bones among them. And they stood out. Bony toothed jaws are rare in the vertebrate record, senior museum scientist Pat Holroyd says. When you see one, you remember it and mentally file it away for later. The bird jaw, which came from a rock formation laid down over 37 million years ago, looks almost like a woodcutting tool rather than a bone. The jaw has a series of large and small spikes, outgrowths of the beak that have a passing resemblance to teeth. On a living animal, the points would have been covered in keratin and given the bird a sinister saw toothed smile. That feature immediately identified the jaw as belonging to a pelagornithid, also known as bony toothed birds that have a very long fossil record. The oldest pelagornithids evolved about 56 million years ago, and the most recent flew through the skies about two million years ago. Their fossils are found all over the world. When Kloess visited the University of California Museum of Paleontology to pore over the collections, Holroyd pointed out the birds jaw bone. The jaw seemed interesting enough for its rarity, but there was much more to the story. I started this research project thinking it would be a short descriptive paper on a jaw fragment to add to the knowledge of a cool group of birds, Kloess says, adding, I had no idea that it would represent a giant individual. Researching the jaw set Kloess and colleagues looking for additional bony toothed bird bones in the museum collections. The researchers were in luck. In addition to the jaw, the collection included a foot bonetechnically called a tarsometatasusfrom another Antarctic pelagnornithid. The bone came from another large individual, but its real importance was in its age. A different researcher who previously studied the foot bone labeled it as belonging a rock unit called the Submeseta Formation, which is between 43 and 35 million years old, but by looking over where the fossil was found the researchers reassigned it to a rock layer in the La Meseta Formation, about 50 million years old. This falls within a time called the Eocene, when life had recovered from the asteroid induced mass extinction and was thriving again. Together, the foot bone and the jaw indicate that large bony toothed birds thrived in the Antarctic for millions of years. Paleontologists have found bony toothed birds from places all over the world, from New Zealand to South Carolina. The newly described Antarctic fossils, though, are the oldest known and hint that these birds quickly diversified into a range of sizes within six million years of their origin. By 50 million years ago, there were bony toothed birds from the size of a modern day albatross to giants with wingspans twice as wide. The next closet fossil contender is an extinct vulture relative called Argentavis, which had a wingspan between 16 and 20 feet. The close competition might be a signal that these birds were pushing the boundaries of flight. Previous studies have calculated that the largest of the bony toothed birds were near the limit of how big a bird could get and still fly, meaning these birds are the strongest contenders for the largest flying birds to ever soar. And matched with the new data on the age of the fossils, Kloess says, we can say that giant pelagornithids appeared earlier than previously known and that Antarctica saw a range of pelagornithid sizes from the early to late Eocene. Small to large, bony toothed birds were an important part of ancient Antarctic ecosystems. Those impressive wings would have allowed the pelagornithids to range far and wide, soaring long distances on outstretched wings. That helps explain why fossils from various species of pelagornithids have been found all over the world during their extended evolutionary tenure. These long lived and successful birds likely using their spiky jaws to feed on fish and squid snatched from just beneath the surface. In the case of the birds described in the new study, the avians lived in an environment that would have seemed strange in some ways and familiar in others. Eocene Antarctica was much warmer than we see today, Kloess says, with carpets of ferns and stands of conifers on land that sheltered prehistoric marsupials and even frogs. Some of the other birds might have seemed familiar, though. Ancient relatives of penguins, albatrosses, and falcons have been found from these rocks, with the bony toothed birds adding to the flock. Naturally, the existence of these big birds raises the question of whether there might be larger fliers out there, especially because fossils of the ancient seabirds are so rare. Its hard to know if we have yet found the largest pelagornithids, Holroyd says."}, {"title": "Hypersensitive Profanity Filter Censors \u2018Bone\u2019 at Paleontology Conference", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "October 19, 2020", "doc": "Participants in the 80th annual Society of Vertebrate Paleontology SVP conference last week knew things were going to be different than usual, as the coronavirus pandemic had forced the entire program online. What the virtual attendees didnt expect was that a profanity filter aimed at keeping attendees verbiage in good taste had run amok. Maria Cramer of the New York Times relays the experience of Thomas R. Holtz Jr., a Tyrannosaurus rex expert at the University of Maryland, who typed Hell Creek Formation in response to a colleagues question following a presentation. But when Holtzs message appeared in the chat, it instead appeared as  Creek Formation. Holtz took to Twitter, where other colleagues shared similar experiences and collaborated to form a list of words banned by the algorithm, some of which happened to be right in the wheelhouse of the paleontology lexicon. Most funny to us was the censorship of bone, which, after all, are the main thing we work with, Holtz tells the Times. Words like bone, pubic and stream are frankly ridiculous to ban in a field where we regularly find pubic bones in streams, Brigid Christison, a masters student in biology at Carleton University, tells Becky Ferreira of Vice. Other words on the list included beaver, ball, stroke, pubis, wang, jerk, knob, stroke, stream, erection, dyke, crack and enlargement, per the list. Convey Services, the company handling the conferences online logistics, was responsible for the pre packaged naughty word filter. All software plug ins are going to have filters in to make sure you dont get out of control,Carolyn Bradfield, chief executive of Convey Services, tells the Times. In that particular case, the filter was too tight...I dont know why in the world the word bone was in there, Bradfield tells the Times. After getting a good belly laugh out of the way on the first day and some creative wording my personal favorite was Heck Creek for Hell Creek, some of us reached out to the business office, and theyve been un banning words as we stumble across them, an SVP member explained on a Reddit thread quoted by Poppy Noor of the Guardian. But some of the banned terms displayed an offensive Western bias. In a tweet, Jack Tseng, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley, notes that Wang is banned but not Johnson both used as slangs. This Western centric filter erasing the surname of 90+ million Chinese but not <2 million people of European descent is unexpectedly on brand for 2020, @SVPvertpaleo My PhD advisor is X.  by the way. Tseng tells Vice that recognizing these biases at the design level, and amending text filter algorithms accordingly would go a long way in creating a more welcoming environment for all participants. But Tseng also commended the swift action taken by SVPs organizers once the issue was raised, telling Vice it was an example of the best first line of response for others who encounter similar issues. The Times notes that the SVP conference is not the first virtual academic conference to run afoul of content filters aimed at keeping proceedings above board.

Rex Sold for $31.8 Million, and Paleontologists Are Worried", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "October 16, 2020", "doc": "In 1987, years before Jurassic Park would kick off a new era of dinomania, fossil hunter Stan Sacrison stumbled upon something interesting eroding out of the South Dakota badlands. Bone fragments gave away the presence of a big dinosaur, and, through an excavation carried out by the commercial fossil outfit Black Hills Institute in 1992, the fossil turned out to be a gorgeous Tyrannosaurus rex. The specimen was nicknamed Stan after its discoverer, and has been replicated in casts all over the world. But now Stan is gaining fame for another reason. The T. rex was just sold for a record breaking amount, opening a new chapter in an ongoing tussle between academics, commercial dealers, and land owners, all based in the foundational question of who fossils belong to. No one was expecting Stan to sell for so much. The famous Tyrannosaurus rex specimen went at auction for 31.8 million on October 6. Thats more than twice the adjusted value of Sue, the most complete T. rex yet found, which sold for over 8.3 million in 1997. But to researchers, fossils are literally priceless. A dinosaur bone or skeleton is not like a painting or classic comic book. Theres no metric to assess its worth because its true value is as a time capsule from a distant time, and what can be learned from that fossil changes as science proceeds. A bone that might seem plain on the outside might hold important information about growth, body chemistry, or other aspects of dinosaur lives. But when a fossil goes to market, what a dinosaur sells for is entirely up to what bidders are willing to payand T. rex is the most sought after dinosaur of all. To date, Stans buyer hasnt been announced. Nor has it been made clear whether the skeleton will end up at a museum like Sue did. The idea that Stan may wind up as a curio in someones home has been a persistent worry of paleontologists as it seems that every year another significant skeleton goes to auction. A fossil kept in private hands is effectively lost to science, and studies of such fossils are often barred from publication. Thats because private owners can often deny access to researchers or sell off specimens to other parties, making it impossible for multiple research teams to verify previous studies. Given the sheer number of papers on the body mass, speed, and bite force of T. rex alone, keeping fossils in the public trust is imperative for paleontology to move forward. Why Stan sold for so much is unclear. There is a whole psychological aspect to the live bidding process, points out University of Maryland paleontologist Thomas Holtz, Jr. If the uniqueness if what the bidder wanted, they didnt get that. Multiple museums have casts of Stan on display, so its not the same as acquiring a new specimen or even a fossil still encased in stone. Naturally, other T. rex specimens are out there. Around 50 partial skeletons have been uncovered, so studies of the dinosaur will still continue. But what worries paleontologists most is how this sale may have private land owners seeing dollar signs when they find fossils on their land. While governments from Alberta, Canada, to Mongolia have natural history heritage laws that protect significant fossils wherever they are found, the United States is different. Dinosaurs and other vertebrate fossils are protected and require a permit if theyre on federal land, but the fate of fossils found on private land is up to the landowner. A rancher who stumbles on a Triceratops eroding out of a hill on their property can dig it up, call a museum, sell off individual pieces, or even smash the bones depending on their wishes. Dinosaurs thus get caught up in ownership tusslesa privately owned specimen known as the Dueling Dinosaurs was recently the subject of a legal battle that found dinosaurs are the property of landowners and not the holders of mineral rights. While commercial collectors have been a part of paleontology since the mid 19th century, the Sue debacle upended everything. Sue is the specimen that monetized fossils in a big way, Holtz says. Initially found in 1990, Sue was embroiled in controversy almost as soon as the dinosaur was out of the ground. The Black Hills Institute claimed they paid land owner Maurice Williams for the dinosaur. Williams disputed that the payment was for excavation permission rather than ownership, and other parties from the Sioux to the United States Department of the Interior claimed ownership of the dinosaur. The FBI raided the Black Hills Institute to take possession of the bones in 1992, the fossils becoming part of a drawn out legal case that raised additional charges of fossil collecting malfeasance. In the end, Williams was given ownership of the fossil and Sue was bought for the Field Museum at auction for over 8 million with the financial help of organizations like Disney and McDonalds. While museums have historically purchased important fossils, and some still do, the multimillion dollar sale of Sue indicated that some fossils could go for more than any museum could afford. Sue wouldnt have ended up at the Field Museum without corporate help. Both the scientific and commercial community, as well as the public, took note of this in the 1990s and the sale of another specimen at such extraordinary price and to an unknown bidder was the exact worry of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontologists, says North Carolina State University historian Elizabeth Jones. Suddenly T. rex was a hot commodity, with researchers and fossil dealers competing over the fate of several specimens that have their own convoluted backstories. Following the sale of Sue, Society of Vertebrate Paleontology president Jessica Theodor says, there were definitely increases in reports of researchers being locked out of sites on private land that they had previously had access to. Partnerships that had in place for years started to become fraught as paleontologists wanted to work on the same outcrops while landowners requested fees, agreements with fossil dealers, or decided to excavate themselves. Given the gobsmacking price on Stan, Theodor says, these tensions may be inflamed again. The global Covid 19 crisis has also put museums in an especially stressful spot. When the pandemic has drastically affected most museums budgets, and staff cuts are widespread, the fear is that there is no way for museums to compete except via courting donors, whose priorities will often differ from what the museum might choose, Theodor says. Not to mention that researchers could often carry out a great deal of research for the same amount of money. Some experts estimated on Twitter that they could run their departments for years, if not centuries, for the same price that Stan sold for. To the consternation of paleontologists, the sale of Stan and the recent Discovery Channel show Dino Hunters are highlighting the price tag of fossils once again. For commercial dealers, dinosaur hunting is not about science but treasure hunting for significant specimens suitable for the homes of the wealthy. This spills over to the black market. Actor Nicolas Cage bought a Tarbosaurus fossila close relative of T. rexthat had to be returned to Mongolia when authorities realized that the dinosaur had been illegally smuggled out of the country. Likewise, paleontologists only know what the weird dinosaur Deinocheirus looked like because fossils of this rare and bizarre animal were rescued from the black market. Public sales like Stan are just the tip of the iceberg. The fact that dinosaurs are more than just objects of scientific curiosity helps drive these high profile sales. For some, a dinosaur is a statement of wealth, power, and influence. Historically, Jones says, financing science was often done in exchange for social influence and public approval while trying to maintain a reputation of scientific credibility. The tycoon Andrew Carnegie, for example, famously wanted the natural history museum that bears his name to have a big, impressive centerpiece dinosaur that still bears the name Diplodocus carnegii. Stans sale and the debate along with it is an outgrowth of this history that will reinforce these tensions in the future, Jones says. That ranchers or private land owners want to cash in is understandable, Holtz says. We could always hope that the majority of landowners will be more interested in the scientific importance of fossil data than their financial benefit, Holtz says, but it is unreasonable to think that everyone will altruistically give up something that might change their livelihood and security. The decades long argument over Americas fossils is at a stalemate. The U.S. isnt likely to declare that fossil found on private land as part of the natural heritage anytime soon, and anyone expecting this to happen doesnt have much experience with looking at how people in the U.S. treat property rights, water rights, and so forth, Holtz says. I imagine that Stan will not be the last mega fossil sale, Jones adds."}, {"title": "Fossilized Footprints Found in New Mexico Track Traveler With Toddler in Tow", "author": "Livia Gershon", "date": "October 14, 2020", "doc": "A small womanor perhaps an adolescent boywalks quickly across a landscape where giant beasts roam. The person holds a toddler on their hip, and their feet slip in the mud as they hurry along for nearly a mile, perhaps delivering the child to a safe destination before returning home alone. Despite the fact that this journey took place more than 10,000 years ago, a new paper published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews manages to sketch out what it might have looked and felt like in remarkable detail. Evidence of the journey comes from fossilized footprints and other evidence discovered in New Mexicos White Sands National Park in 2018, reports Albuquerque TV station KRQE. Toward the end of the late Pleistocene epochbetween 11,550 and 13,000 years agohumans and animals left hundreds of thousands of tracks in the mud along the shore of what was once Lake Otero. The new paper investigates one specific set of tracks, noting details in the footprints shapes that reveal how the travelers weight shifted as they moved the child from one hip to the other. We can see the evidence of the carry in the shape of the tracks, write study co authors Matthew Robert Bennett and Sally Christine Reynolds, both of Bournemouth University in England, for the Conversation. They are broader due to the load, more varied in morphology often with a characteristic banana shapesomething that is caused by outward rotation of the foot. At some points along the journey, the toddlers footprints appear as well, most likely because the walker set the child down to rest or adjust their position. For most of the trip, the older caretaker carried the child at a speed of around 3.8 miles per houran impressive pace considering the muddy conditions. Each track tells a story a slip here, a stretch there to avoid a puddle, explain Bennett and Reynolds. The ground was wet and slick with mud and they were walking at speed, which would have been exhausting. On the return trip, the adult or adolescent followed the same course in reverse, this time without the child. The researchers theorize that this reflects a social network in which the person knew that they were carrying the child to a safe destination. Was the child sick? they ask. Or was it being returned to its mother? Did a rainstorm quickly come in catching a mother and child off guard? We have no way of knowing and it is easy to give way to speculation for which we have little evidence. The fossilized footprints show that at least two large animals crossed the human tracks between the outbound and return trips. Prints left by a sloth suggest the animal was aware of the humans who had passed the same way before it. As the sloth approached the trackway, it reared up on its hind legs to sniff for danger before moving forward. A mammoth who also walked across the tracks, meanwhile, shows no sign of having noticed the humans presence. White Sands National Park contains the largest collection of Ice Age human and animal tracks in the world. As Alamogordo Daily News reports, scientists first found fossilized footprints at the park more than 60 years ago. But researchers only started examining the tracks intensively in the past decade, when the threat of erosion became readily apparent. The international team of scientists behind the new paper has found evidence of numerous kinds of human and animal activity. Tracks testify to children playing in puddles formed by giant sloth tracks and jumping between mammoth tracks, as well as offering signs of human hunting practices. Researchers and National Park Service officials say the newest findings are remarkable partly for the way they allow modern humans to relate to their ancient forebears. I am so pleased to highlight this wonderful story that crosses millennia, says Marie Sauter, superintendent of White Sands National Park, in a statement. Seeing a childs footprints thousands of years old reminds us why taking care of these special places is so important."}, {"title": "New Study Reignites Debate Over Which Species Shed the First Fossil Feather Ever Found", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "October 1, 2020", "doc": "New research may settle a decades long debate about the true owner of a 150 million year old fossilized feather, reports Lucas Joel for the New York Times. Found in a German limestone quarry in 1861, this solitary piece of mineralized plumage was the first fossil feather ever discovered. Since then, paleontologists have argued over whether or not the feather belongs to Archaeopteryx lithographica, a small dinosaur that, with its combination of sharp teeth, feathered wings and hollow bones, is a famous evolutionary forebear to modern birds. The issue is that the feather was discovered sans skeleton, leaving the question of its donors identity unsettled for some, though many assert that the historic fossil likely came from the wing of an Archaeopteryx. In 2019, a notable paper forcefully argued that the feather did not come from Archaeopteryx at all, reports Michael Greshko for National Geographic. Now, a new piece of research, published this week in the journal Scientific Reports, claims to settle the debate in favor of the feather belonging to Archaeopteryx. Theres been debate for the past 159 years as to whether or not this feather belongs to the same species as the Archaeopteryx skeletons, as well as where on the body it came from and its original color, says Ryan Carney, a paleontologist at the University of South Florida who led the new research, in a statement. Through scientific detective work that combined new techniques with old fossils and literature, we were able to finally solve these centuries old mysteries. Carney and his co authors say the feathers shape and location dovetail with the idea that it was loosed from an Archaeopteryx wing. The team compared the lone feather with others that were still attached to Archaeopteryx skeletons. They found it had a similar length, width and curvature, according to the Times. With the help of digital renderings of fossil specimens and the feather itself, the researchers were able to slot the feathers outline into the wing of an Archaeopteryx. It fit perfectly among the primary feathers of the fossil wings examined in the study. Moreover, the fossil site from which the feather emerged has also produced four Archaeopteryx specimens, providing further evidence that the feather and the extinct species coincided in space and time. To me, that map was like, boom, case closed, because theres no other dinosaurs in that region that had  very advanced flight feathers, which are the most advanced kind of feathers on the bird and dinosaur body, Carney tells National Geographic. The team even used a specialized electron microscope to examine the molecular structure of the feather. This up close look revealed the feather came from a creatures left wing, and illuminated pigment molecules, called melanosomes, that suggest the feather was matte black. This conclusion differs from the results of another study which claimed the feather was black and white, per the statement. Peter Wellnhofer, a paleontologist at the Paleontological Museum in Munich who was not involved in the new research, tells the Times he was impressed by the new research. They did not exclude different interpretations, but put forward their own view, well founded with new and convincing arguments, he adds. One of the authors of the 2019 study, paleontologist Michael Pittman of the University of Hong Kong, tells the Times the new results cant rule out that another bird or other species didnt drop the feather. Pittman tells National Geographic that he and the co authors of the 2019 research are working on a response to Carneys new work, suggesting this debate hasnt yet landed."}, {"title": "Fossil Teeth Bolster Notion That Spinosaurus Was a \u2018River Monster\u2019", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "September 28, 2020", "doc": "Catapulted into dino fame by its inclusion in the Jurassic Park franchise, Spinosaurus was a fearsome, 50 foot long predator that lived some 95 million years ago. But despite its newfound notoriety, Spinosaurus is not an easy creature to categorize. Since its discovery in Egypt in 1910, the dinosaurs strange combination of featuresfrom its elongated, crocodilian snout to the six foot sail jutting out of its backhave led to rampant speculation about its lifestyle. Paleontologists and the public wanted to know Was this extinct celebrity more at home in the water or on land? Now, researchers think theyve finally proven that Spinosaurus was a consummate freshwater predator. New research, published this week in the journal Cretaceous Research, details a trove of more than 1,200 dinosaur teeth discovered in ancient riverbeds in Morocco. Spinosaurus cone shaped teeth accounted for nearly half of the dentition that drifted to the bottom of these ancient rivers nearly 100 million years ago, reports Michael Greshko for National Geographic. The enhanced abundance of Spinosaurus teeth, relative to other dinosaurs, is a reflection of their aquatic lifestyle, says David Martill, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth, in a statement. Martill explains that the presence of so many Spinosaurus teeth in the sediments of the Kem Kem river system that once flowed through what is now the Sahara Desert suggests the huge dinosaurs spent much of their lives in the water. From this research we are able to confirm this location as the place where this gigantic dinosaur not only lived but also died. The results are fully consistent with the idea of a truly water dwelling, river monster, says Martill in the statement. The new findings strengthen prior research that also pointed to Spinosaurus being adept in the water. Earlier this year another paper described paddle like bones from Spinosaurus tail, arguing that they were clear signs that the gargantuan predator was well adapted to swimming, according to BBC News. When you study the bones, its very difficult to understand how these animals were actually interacting with their ecosystem, Matteo Fabbri, a paleontologist at Yale University who wasnt involved in the new study, tells National Geographic. This study is important because its looking at the ecosystem itself. Back in 1944, as Katherin Wu reported for Smithsonian magazine in April, the study of Spinosaurus experienced a major setback when the only known partial skeleton was destroyed in a bombing raid that blew up Munichs Paleontological Museum. As the many years of debate can attest, its taken decades for paleontologists to put the pieces of this massive animals prehistoric life back together. Per National Geographic, the preponderance of teeth in the Kem Kem riverbed sediments could also be explained by Spinosaurus having adopted a wading approach to snagging fish at the waters edge. But, the researchers note in their paper that the rest of the creatures anatomy would have made this an exceedingly awkward proposition, suggesting to them that Spinosaurus swam for its dinner."}, {"title": "New Species of Burrowing Dinosaur May Have Died During \u2018Cretaceous Pompeii\u2019 ", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "September 24, 2020", "doc": "Paleontologists have unearthed a new species of burrowing dinosaur that once walked on two legs some 125 million years ago in modern day China, reports Jon Haworth for ABC News. A new paper describing the species, published this month in the journal PeerJ, argues it is the most primitive ornithopodthe family of dinosaurs that includes bipedal duck billed species such as Iguanodonever found. Found in northeastern Chinas Liaoning Province, researchers named the dinosaur Changmiania liaoningensis after the serene postures of the two almost perfectly preserved skeletons that underpin the discoverychangmian means eternal sleep in Chinese. The digging dinos near immaculate fossilization may have been the result of an unpleasant demise. Some researchers suggest a volcanic eruption likely trapped the nearly four foot long Changmiania underground where it may have suffocated or starved to death. These animals were quickly covered by fine sediment while they were still alive or just after their death, says Pascal Godefroit, a palaeontologist at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and co author of the research, in a statement. Such pristine, three dimensional fossilization is typical of northeastern Chinas Yixian Formation, specifically the Lujiatun Beds, where the specimens were found. The hypothesis that volcanism is responsible for the sites spectacular fossils has caused some to refer to it as the Chinese Pompeii or the Cretaceous Pompeii. Changmiania was herbivorous and would have been a fast, upright runner, despite the other aspects of its physiology that suggested the dinosaur was a proficient digger, reports Lauren Johnson for CNN. Certain characteristics of the skeleton suggest that Changmiania could dig burrows, much like rabbits do today, says Godefroit in the statement. Its neck and forearms are very short but robust, its shoulder blades are characteristic of burrowing vertebrates and the top of its snout is shaped like a shovel. According to the statement, Godefroit thinks both specimens succumbed to the sudden volcanic event while resting at the bottom of their burrows 125 million years ago."}, {"title": "Scientists Discover Oldest Sperm Yet Preserved in Amber", "author": "Theresa Machemer", "date": "September 21, 2020", "doc": "Scientists have identified 100 million year old sperm in a postage stamp sized piece of amber, Stephanie Pappas reports for Live Science. The sperm belong to an ancient ostracod, a tiny crustacean with a two piece shell similar to a clam and shrimp like legs that poke out of the shells opening. The sperm is the oldest example yet to be identified50 million years older than the previous record holder, which was found in the cocoon of an extinct species of Antarctic worm. But also, the sperm is gigantic. At least, relative to the half millimeter long creature that produced itthis sperm unspools to a jaw dropping 0.46 inches 11.8 millimeters, far longer than the animal that produces it, writes Pappas.  The sperm in the amber was discovered inside of a female ostracod, which suggests she mated just before the trees resin entombed her. She is one of 39 half millimeter crustaceans preserved in the amber sample. A total of 31 of those belonged to a previously unidentified species ostracod, now named Myanmarcypris hui. The reproductive strategy of using gigantic sperm is unusual, but not entirely unique. Modern ostracods have giant sperm, too, as does one species of modern fruit fly, writes Becky Ferreira, reporting for Vice. But the giant sperm preserved in amber and described in a paper published last week in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, shows that strategy can be surprisingly successful. Previously, we were not sure if animals that switched to using these giant sperm at a certain point in their evolutionary history are doomed to become extinct very quickly, one of the studys authors Renate Matzke Karasz, a paleontologist from Ludwig Maximillian University paleontologist tells Emma Betuel of Inverse. But in ostracods, it worked for more than 100 million years. Extra large sperm require extra large reproductive organs to move them around, enormous costs, Matzke Karasz explains to Vice. Unlike a group of smaller swimmers that can move on their own, giant sperm need to be ferried straight to their destination. And both male and female ostracods have pairs of reproductive organstwo sperm pumps and penises on each male, and two paired vaginas in each female. This is a lot of biological energy that must be allocated to reproduction, so you might think that this doesnt make sense from an evolutionary standpoint, Matzke Karasz tells VICE. But after 100 million years, for ostracods, there must be an advantage, otherwise it wouldnt exist anymore. The research team used 3D X ray techniques to map the soft tissues of the preserved ostracods. When Chinese Academy of Sciences paleontologist He Wang mapped the sperm, it looked like a messy, coiled ball. The longest continuous cell found is at least 200 microns long, about a third of the creatures body length. Wang sent the 3D image to Matzke Karasz to get a closer look. I immediately congratulated him on having reconstructed the oldest animal sperm, Matzke Karasz tells Live Science. The researchers can estimate the age of their sample because the amber was mined in Myanmar, where all of the amber is about 100 million years old. But as the Atlantics Katharine Gammon reported in 2019, amber there is mined under dangerous conditions and some scientists have begun to question the ethics of studying it. Joshua Sokol and Wudan Yan reported for Science magazine in 2019 that the sale of Burmese amber may fund the army and militias fighting in northern Myanmar. The amber in the new study was mined near Noije Bum Village, Danai Town in northern Myanmar, according to the paper. The amber was held by a private collector in China, who noticed the tiny creatures encapsulated inside and offered it for scientific study, Matzke Karasz tells Inverse. The amber is now held in the Lingpoge Amber Museum, according to the paper."}, {"title": "You Can Buy This T.

The 67 million year old fossil is estimated to sell for a cool 6 million to 8 million, reports Eileen Kinsella for artnet News. As Zachary Small reports for the New York Times, until October 21, pedestrians and dinosaur enthusiasts can catch a glimpse of the prize fighter of antiquity behind floor to ceiling glass windows in Christies 49th Street offices in New York City. The ancient dinosaur is nicknamed Stan, after the amateur paleontologist Stan Sacrison who first uncovered its bones in the Hell Creek Formation in South Dakota in 1987. Five years after the initial discovery, scientists spent 30,000 hours carefully extracting each of Stans 188 fossilized bones, reports Jack Guy for CNN. Now one of the most complete T. rex skeletons in the world, Stan has been preserved in the Black Hills Institute in South Dakota for the last two decades. There, scientists have used his bones to write countless academic studies, making it one of the most researched T. rex skeletons of all time, per a Christies blog post. Stan grew up in the humid, semi tropical region of Laramidiathe part of the continent thats now North and South Dakota. Starting out the size of a small turkey, he grew to weigh about seven to eight tons, or twice the weight of an African elephant. As an adult, he could run at speeds up to 25 miles per hour, and his baseball sized eyes allowed him to spot things up to nearly four miles six kilometers away, per Christies. According to the Institute, researchers studying his skeleton found that Stan suffered a broken neck during his lifetime, after which two vertebrae fused together. T. rexes were likely both predators and scavengers, although scientists have debated the dinosaurs eating habits for years, as Riley Black reported for Smithsonian magazine in 2011. Ill never forget the moment I came face to face with Stan for the first time, says James Hyslop, the head of the scientific instruments and natural history department for Christies, in a press release. He adds He looked even larger and more ferocious than Id imagined. The last time an auction house carried out a sale of these prehistoric proportions was in 1997, when Sothebys sold T. rex skeleton Sue to the Chicago Field Museum for a record 8.3 million. Riley Black reported for National Geographic in 2013 that paleontologists have excavated about 50 T. rex skeletons to date. It remains to be seen who, whether an individual or an institution, will take the bait in October and bid on Stan. Hyslop calls the opportunity a once in a generation chance. T. rex is a brand name in a way that no other dinosaur is, says Hyslop in the statement, adding that for the right buyer, the skeleton might compliment their high art treasures.

The adult bear lived its life sometime in the last Ice Age, at the same time as large animals like woolly mammoths, mastodons and saber toothed tigers. When the bear died, permafrost preserved its soft tissues, organs and fur, making it the best preserved example of a cave bear found yet. Most cave bear remains discovered so far have been odd bones and skulls. Coincidentally, a preserved cave bear cub was recently found on the Russian mainland, the university says in a statement. Using the two discoveries, scientists hope to learn more about cave bears lives. The whole, adult bear carcass is the first and only find of its kind, paleontologist Lena Grigorieva says in the university statement. It is completely preserved, with all internal organs in place, including even its nose. This find is of great importance for the whole world. Reindeer herders working on the island discovered the ancient bear carcass and reported it to the university, which specializes in studying preserved Ice Age mammals. The team identified it as a cave bear, a species of bear thats now extinct. Its last common ancestor with modern bears lived about 1.2 to 1.4 million years ago, according to a study published in the journal Current Biology in 2001, George Dvorsky reports for Gizmodo. Cave bears could weigh up to 1,540 pounds, which is larger than most polar bears. The cave bear carcass found on Bolshyoy Lyakhovsky probably lived between 22,000 and 39,500 years ago, and the researchers hope to narrow that window with further research. The cave bear adult and cub are the latest additions to a growing list of preserved Ice Age carcasses emerging from the permafrost. Experts expect more preserved animals to appear as permafrost melting accelerates because of climate change. Researchers have uncovered woolly mammoths on the Lyakhovsky islands, and last year, scientists found a 40,000 year old wolfs head, Aylin Woodward reports for Business Insider. The wolf head still had its fur, teeth, brain and facial tissue. This year, scientists at the Centre for Palaeogenetics at Stockholm University analyzed the DNA of Ice Age lion cubs discovered in Yakutsk, per Gizmodo. Similar ancient DNA analysis revealed that woolly rhinos that lived during the Ice Age were likely driven extinct not by humans, as previously thought, but by a warming climate, Alex Fox reported for Smithsonian magazine in August. The cave bear carcass presents several opportunities for new research into Ice Age ecosystems. Analysis of its teeth might reveal details about its diet and the territory it grew up on analysis of the contents of its stomach will show whether the bear ate plants, animals or both and ancient DNA analysis could illuminate its evolutionary history. The research is planned on as large a scale as in the study of the famous Malolyakhovsky mammoth, which researchers attempting to clone, Grigorieva says in the statement."}, {"title": "Why Birds Survived, and Dinosaurs Went Extinct, After an Asteroid Hit Earth", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "September 15, 2020", "doc": "Birds are the only dinosaurs left. That might seem strange. A pigeon or a penguin doesnt look much like a Tyrannosaurus. But the connection is still there, all the way down to the bone. About 150 million years ago, in the Jurassic, the first birds evolved from small, feathery, raptor like dinosaurs, becoming another branch on the dinosaur family tree. For more than 80 million years, birds of all sorts flourished, from loon like swimmers with teeth to beaked birds that carried streamer like feathers as they flew. With hindsight, birds can be categorized as avian dinosaurs and all the other sortsfrom Stegosaurus to Brontosaurusare non avian dinosaurs. The entire reason paleontologists make that split is because of a catastrophe that struck 66 million years ago. An asteroid more than 6 miles across struck whats now the Yucatan Peninsula, triggering the fifth mass extinction in the worlds history. Some of the debris thrown into the atmosphere returned to Earth, the friction turning the air into an oven and sparking forest fires as it landed all over the world. Then the intensity of the heat pulse gave way to a prolonged impact winter, the sky blotted out by soot and ash as temperatures fell. All told, more than 75 percent of species known from the end of the Cretaceous period, 66 million years ago, didnt make it to the following Paleogene period. The geologic break between the two is called the K Pg boundary, and beaked birds were the only dinosaurs to survive the disaster. There has been a lot of discussion about what enabled modern type birds to survive the K Pg extinction while other birds groups, non avian dinosaurs, and even pterosaurs perished, says Royal BC Museum paleontologist Derek Larson. The end of the Cretaceous boasted an entire array of birds and bird like reptiles. But of these groups, it was only the beaked birds that survived. The happenstances of evolution had given birds a lucky break, the key events set in motion long before the asteroid struck. All living birds have toothless beaks, but this wasnt always so. The very first bird, the 150 million year old Archaeopteryx, initially confounded 19th century naturalists because it had teeth. For tens of millions of years after Archaeopteryx, toothed birds continued to thrive and evolve alongside their dinosaurian relatives. And some of these toothed birds eventually lost their teeth, plucking up their meals with toothless beaks instead. The question is what evolutionary pressures pushed birds to lose teeth when teeth seem so useful. Given that most birds fly, adaptation to the air seemed like a possibility. Older hypotheses focused on the idea of weight reduction for flight, says University of Texas at Austin paleontologist Grace Musser, but the discovery that some toothed birds were strong fliers has led researchers back to the drawing board. Rather than flight, food might have given birds an evolutionary nudge towards toothless beaks as ancient avians thrived among other dinosaurs. Paleontologists have noticed that some dinosaur groups, including birds, evolved beaks and lost teeth as they became more herbivorous. While the earliest birds had teeth to nab insects and other small morsels, some bird lineages started to specialize on fruit, seeds, and other plant foods. Instead of teeth to catch, the birds evolved beaks to pluck and pick. Among the birds that began to lose teeth in favor of beaks, the way beaks form during development may have helped the evolutionary shift. Changes to the skull and face as the beak became more complex may have moved developing tissues around, changing how they interact in the embryo, and resulted in the loss of tooth formation, says Kings College London anatomist Abigail Tucker. All the things that make birds, birds, were already in place well before the mass extinction, says University College London anatomist Ryan Felice. When the extinction struck, the traits birds had been evolving for millions of years made the difference between life and death. While some birds survived the impact and its aftermath, not all of them did. When we think about hypotheses of traits that let birds survive, we need to take into account that it was only a small sliver of diversity that made it to the other side, Felice says. Entire groups of birds, such as toothed birds called enantiornithes, went extinct. Its unlikely that one single trait determined the fate of all these species. Still, surviving extinction often comes down to luck, and beaks may have been some birds ace. By the end of the Cretaceous, beaked birds were already eating a much more varied diet than their toothed relatives. These birds werent specialized on insects or other animal food, and so they were able to pluck up hard food items like seeds and nuts. And in the aftermath of the extinction, when animal life was severely cut back, those hard, persistent little morsels got beaked birds through the hard times. Beaked birds were able to feed on the seeds of the destroyed forests and wait out the decades until vegetation began to return. Not that beaks guaranteed survival of the impact event. The duck like bird Vegavis lived at the end of the Cretaceous and had a beak, yet theres no indication that this avian survived. Just having a beak was not enough, Tucker says. Rather, its that birds with beaks and powerful gizzards capable of crushing tough seeds had an unexpected advantage that increased their chances of survival. Both fossils and the timeline of bird evolution discerned from their genetic relationships indicates that early members of modern bird groupssuch as birds related to ducks, parrots, and chickenswere around by time the asteroid struck. These groups still suffered losses, but enough survived to set up a new pulse of bird evolution in the millions of years following the catastrophe. Many bird lineages became smaller in size while maintaining their brain size. Through evolutionary shrinking, birds wound up with larger brains compared to their body size, setting the stage for avian intelligence beyond what the non avian dinosaurs could have evolved. But big evolutionary changes often come with constraints. The loss of teeth does limit the number of dietary niches birds could explore, Felice says. Herbivorous mammals and non avian dinosaurs evolved ever growing teeth so that could continue eating as the plants wore their teeth down, but this just isnt possible with a beak, Felice says. And that means that bird skulls havent needed to vary as much to support different jaws and ways of feeding, meaning that birds look like evolutionary slowpokes compared to non avian dinosaursas Felice and colleagues found in a new study of bird skull evolution. To understand more about how birds managed to survive and make a living in a world recovering from one of the worst mass extinctions of all time, the task at hand is to find more fossils from the time directly following the mass extinction, from a time called the Paleocene. Paleontologists have some great examples of fossil birds from about 10 million years after the disaster, from a time called the Eocene, but birds fossils from the slice in between the Cretaceous and Eocene are fragmentary and hard to find. These are the bones that may reveal new secrets."}, {"title": "How to Weigh a Dinosaur", "author": "Jennifer Nalewicki", "date": "September 3, 2020", "doc": "Weighing a dinosaur is no easy task. These extinct creatures were massive, and for the most part, all that remains are their bones, as their organs and skin have long since decomposed. However, new research has found more than one way to measure the mass of these giant creatures that roamed the planet millions of years ago. In a paper entitled The Accuracy and Precision of Body Mass Estimation in Non avian Dinosaurs, published this month in the scientific journal Biological Reviews, a team of scientists from the University of New Englands Palaeoscience Research Centre evaluated the two existing ways scientists approach calculating how much a Tyrannosaurus rex might have weighed. Interestingly, neither method involves pulling out an actual scale. Led by paleontologist Nicol\u00e1s Campione of the University of New England, the researchers examined an extensive database of dinosaur body mass estimates from as far back as 1905, with weight estimates for individual specimens ranging anywhere from three tons to a whopping 18 tons. For reference, the average sedan weighs a measly 1.5 tons. Body size, in particular body mass, determines almost all aspects of an animals life, including their diet, reproduction and locomotion, says Campione in a Royal Ontario Museum press release. If we know that we have a good estimate of a dinosaurs body mass, then we have a firm foundation from which to study and understand their life retrospectively. In an essay published by The Conversation, Campione explains that for years, paleontologists followed two rival approaches for tallying a dinosaurs poundage. These methods were long thought to be at odds with each other, but Campiones team found that both techniques are actually quite accurate. Using limb circumference to find out an animals mass is already widely used across a variety of modern land animals, like primates, marsupials, and turtles, writes Campione. The same scaling method can be applied to dinosaurs. Researchers essentially measure the bones in living animals, such as the femur in an elephants leg, and compare that figure to dinosaurs femur.  The second method involves calculating the volume of 3 D reconstructions of dinosaurs, which serve as approximations of what the creature wouldve looked like when it was still alive. Occassionally, these methods have come to very different conclusions. For The Conversation, Campione presents a recent example of a discrepancy  A 3 D reconstruction of the gigantic titanosaur Dreadnoughtus, which lived roughly 80 million years ago in what is now Argentina, suggested a body mass between 27 and 38 tonnes. Yet its colossal legs suggest it could have supported even more weight between 44 and 74 tonnes. But after applying both methods repeatedly to an ample number of specimens in the database, it became clear that the case of the titanosaur was an outlier. In fact, the two approaches are more complementary than antagonistic, Campione says in a statement. David Evans, a paleontologist at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto and senior author of the paper, says their conclusion illustrates the importance of using both methods in tandemand highlights the importance of uncertainty, because dinosaurs, like humans, did not come in one neat package, according to the university statement. There will always be uncertainty around our understanding of long extinct animals, and their weight is always going to be a source of it, he says in a statement. Our new study suggests we are getting better at weighing dinosaurs, and it paves the way for more realistic dinosaur body mass estimation in the future."}, {"title": "Hibernation May Be a 250-Million-Year-Old Survival Trick", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "September 1, 2020", "doc": "New research suggests a strange looking, 250 year old animal may have hibernated, reports Will Dunham for Reuters. The stumpy, tusked creature, called Lystrosaurus, may be oldest example of an animal known to enter a hibernation like state. Researchers discovered evidence that the pig sized Lystrosaurus slowed its metabolism to enter a state of torporcharacterized by decreased physiological activity and lower body temperatureby studying its fossilized tusks, the team reported last week in the journal Communications Biology. Despite hailing from the early Triassic and predating the dinosaurs, Lystrosaurus is actually more closely related to mammals. Its an odd animal, Megan R. Whitney, a paleontologist at Harvard University and co author of the paper, tells Kenneth Chang of the New York Times. Its kind of a sausage shape. And it had no teeth except for the two tusks that came out from the face. In lieu of teeth, this less than dapper herbivore had a turtle like beak and probably used its tusks to forage for roots and tubers across its range, which once spanned modern day India, South America and Africa, reports Lauren M. Johnson for CNN. To learn more about the differences between these populations, the researchers compared cross sections of Lystrosaurus tusks found on different continents. Because the ancient animals tusks grew continuously, they created growth rings similar to a tree that can be used to infer things such as the individuals age and growth rate. To see the specific signs of stress and strain brought on by hibernation, you need to look at something that can fossilize and was growing continuously during the animals life, says Christian Sidor, a paleontologist at the University of Washington and co author of the research, in a statement. Many animals dont have that, but luckily Lystrosaurus did. The team found that the Lystrosaurus specimens found in Antarctica featured densely packed, thick ringssigns that environmental stresses slowed or halted the tusks growth, per the Times. The specimens from South Africa, by contrast, told no similar tales of hardship. The researchers interpret these periods of low or no growth among the Antarctic Lystrosaurus as evidence that the creatures entered a state of torpor to survive the polar continents long, dark winters. The Antarctic winters of a quarter of a billion years ago were much warmer than today but the lack of sunlight would have likely still snuffed out many of the mammalian ancestors food sources. What we observed in the Antarctic Lystrosaurus tusks fits a pattern of small metabolic reactivation events during a period of stress, which is most similar to what we see in warm blooded hibernators today, says Whitney in the statement. These preliminary findings indicate that entering into a hibernation like state is not a relatively new type of adaptation. It is an ancient one. The ability to slow down its metabolism when times got tough may have helped Lystrosaurus survive the Great Dyinga mass extinction event that killed off 90 percent of all life in the oceans and more than two thirds of all species on land approximately 252 million years ago."}, {"title": "College Students Unearth Massive Triceratops Skull", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "August 26, 2020", "doc": "A group of undergraduates and their paleontology professor discovered a seven foot, 3,000 pound Triceratops skull in the Badlands of South Dakota, reports Shahla Farzan for St. Louis Public Radio.

I just keep telling people, we were really in the right place at the right time, Schmidt tells Olivia Garrett of the Fulton Sun. When Schmidt and the students arrived at the site, they immediately noticed the bone that had caught the ranchers eye It was kind of long and cylindrical, Schmidt tells the Fulton Sun.

Beginning this June, the team returned to the specimen brimming with anticipation. Schmidt and the students carefully burrowed into the Badlands sandstone with pickaxes and shovels with increasing disbelief. As we continued to uncover more parts of the skull, I was in denial, Schmidt tells St. Louis Public Radio. I was thinking, This cant be a skull. How lucky would I be? That probably only happens to a very tiny fraction of people on this planet. Like, I cant be one of those. Two months of excavation revealed the 66 million year old fossil was indeed the skull of a species called Triceratops prorsus. The group named the fossil Shady after the nearby community of Shadehill. The skull has now been encased in plaster and shipped 800 miles to Westminster College for study. But Schmidt says more bones still need to be dug up at the site. We were uncovering more and more bones, but we got to a point where we couldnt collect any more, Schmidt tells St. Louis Public Radio. We feel like, based on what weve seen so far, we may have quite a bit of the skeleton there, which is very, very exciting. The skull and the site in South Dakota will provide ongoing research opportunities for undergraduates at Westminster College, and perhaps offer some clues about the life of this titan of the Cretaceous."}, {"title": "\u2018Ammonite\u2019 Is Historical Fan Fiction About the World\u2019s First Great Fossil Hunter", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "August 26, 2020", "doc": "Paleontology wouldnt be the same without Mary Anning. She scoured the dreary coast of southern England for secrets not seen since the Jurassic, fueling the nascent 19th century field of fossil studies with evidence of strange sea dragons, flying reptiles and other fascinating fragments of life long past. And now, over 170 years after her death, shes got her own movie. Ammonite will open at the Toronto Film Festival but isnt set to premiere in theaters or in homes until later this year, but the historical drama is already stirring the waters like an excitable Plesiosaurus. The first trailer for the film hit the web yesterday. The tale, directed by British filmmaker Francis Lee, follows Anning Kate Winslet as she reluctantly brings a young woman named Charlotte Murchison Saoirse Ronan along on some fossil hunting trips in the hope that the vigorous activity will help her new apprentices illness. But the two find more than fossils. In Lees telling, Anning and Murchison begin an intense affair that seems to have no room to breathe under the cultural strictures of Victorian England. In other words, this is paleo fanfic. The real Anning was an expert fossil collector and paleontologist who combed the beaches of Lyme Regis and the surrounding area for fossils that eroded from the Jurassic rock. You can retrace her steps on the same beaches, as I did during my own visit to England a few years ago, and maybe even find a little golden spiral along the tidelineancient, shelled relatives of squid called ammonites. Anning wasnt alone in her exploits. Fossil hunting was a family business, and Annings father, Richard, took Mary and her brother Joseph on excursions to collect ammonites and other pieces they then sold as tourist curios. When Richard died, the rest of the family took over the business. And they were good at it. In 1811, Joseph found the gorgeous skull of an Ichthyosaurus Mary later collected more bones from the same animal. Of course, thats to say nothing of the Philpot sisters. Elizabeth, Louise and Margaret Philpot collected fossils in the Lyme Regis area when Anning was still a child, and Elizabeth became a mentor who encouraged her student to understand both the science and the market value of what she found. Even Annings dog Tray, a black and white terrier, went along on fossil trips and would stay at specific spots to mark a fossils location while the pooch waited for Marys return. Thanks to her discoveries, sketches and notes, Anning eventually became a rock star in her own right. Its at this point, when she had established her own fossil shop, that Ammonite finds Anning. But while Murchison really was one of Annings friends, no evidence suggests that the two had any kind of romantic ties. In fact, no evidence of the paleontologists love lifebeyond her drive to keep digging into the Blue Lias strata that produced so many bonesexists at all. Turning Annings remarkable story into a torrid romance has already incensed some would be viewers. Reactions have run the gamut from objections to historical inaccuracy and homophobia, with little resolution given that were far too late to ask Anning herself. In defending his choice, Lee snapped back against the anti queer underpinnings of the outrage and said he sees Ammonite as another part of his efforts to continually explore the themes of class, gender, sexuality within my work, treating my truthful characters with utter respect. Focusing on Annings romantic life, even if entirely invented, is a way to see her as a whole person, not just the woman who sells seashells down by the seashore. I have to wonder what Anning would say to this. As she wrote in a letter, The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone. In the sexist, male dominated world of 19th century science, Annings finds were celebrated while she herself was barred from joining academic societies or even finding a path to gain equal footing with the likes of William Buckland, Gideon Mantell and other traditional heroes of paleontology who parasitized her labor. Now, in having her lifes story made a fiction, is the world using Anning again? In all the hubbub over Ammonites portrayal of Anning, commenters have continually missed a critical point. Anning never married, and we dont know if she had romantic or sexual relationships with anyone. Lee, and some others, have taken this as a hint that Anning may have been a lesbian and hid the fact to avoid controversy. But its equally possible that Anning was asexual or uninterested in romance. Perhaps, then, Ammonite is an exercise in erasure wrapped in progressive packaging, ignoring what we know of Anning in an attempt to read between the lines. The truth died when Anning did. How audiences will experience Ammonite will largely depend on what they bring to it. If theyre expecting a historically accurate biopic, they may sit back on their couch fuming. Ammonite is to paleontology what The Untouchables is to Prohibition or Raiders of the Lost Ark is to archaeology. If viewers are looking for a queer romance set against a wave battered backdrop, they may feel a little warmer to the treatment. The sheer pressure put on Ammonite to fulfill our fossiliferous expectations says something about our current moment in science. The accomplishments and importance of women in paleontology are far more prominent than they were in Annings time, yet the standard image of a paleontologist remains an Indiana Jones wannabe focused on trophy hunting dinosaurs. And when it comes to diversity within the field across positionsfrom volunteer and student all the way up to professorsthere remains a diversity gap that even cisgendered, straight, white women are fighting against, to say nothing of better support and representation for everyone else who falls outside those narrow categories. And so we keep turning to Anning as a singular hero, a woman who made amazing and lasting contributions against the odds. She, and the women whose careers were intertwined with hers, deserves to be honored just like the men who fill the introduction sections of paleontology textbooks. At the same time, perhaps we are asking Anning to carry too muchto be the sole representative of an entirely different view of paleontology. If representation for women in the field were better, perhaps it would not feel as if so much is at stake. As it stands, we are so starved for stories other than the Great White Fossil Hunter that its almost impossible for any tale to satisfy everyone. If were fortunate, some future paleontologist will be able to point to Ammonite and say its the first time they got to see themselves represented. I hope so. For the time being, though, Im looking forward to the evening when my girlfriend and I can curl up on the couch and watch a romance about warm hearts and cold stone, even if we know Mary Annings truth requires a bit more digging to find."}, {"title": "Fallen Boulder at the Grand Canyon Reveals Prehistoric Reptile Footprints", "author": "Nora McGreevy", "date": "August 25, 2020", "doc": "Geologist Allan Krill was hiking along the Grand Canyon National Parks Bright Angel Trail with a group of students in 2016 when he spotted it a fallen boulder lying just off the side of the trail, with curious markings that resembled footprints. Krill, who was visiting the University of Nevada, Las Vegas UNLV from Norway, sent photos of his find to an old friend and colleague, Stephen Rowland, a UNLV paleontologist. Krills discovery turned out to be ancient fossilized footprints. The find was initially announced at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontologys Annual Meeting in 2018. Now, in a new paper published last week in PLOS One, Rowland estimates that the imprints could be up to about 313 million years old, making them the oldest vertebrate fossil tracks ever found in the Park, according to a National Park Service statement. Additionally, these footprints could be some of the earliest known evidence of a hard shelled egg laying animalwhats known as an amniotein the world, reports Shaena Montanari for the Arizona Republic. These are by far the oldest vertebrate tracks in Grand Canyon, which is known for its abundant fossil tracks says Rowland in the statement. Whats more, he adds, they are among the oldest tracks on Earth of shelled egg laying animals, such as reptiles, and the earliest evidence of vertebrate animals walking in sand dunes. The track bearing boulder weighs hundreds of pounds and had fallen from the Manakacha Formation, a large outcropping of sandstone thats about 314 million years old, reports Harmeet Kaur for CNN. The tracks formed when they got wet and then were covered in sand, which preserved the markings for millions of years, reports George Dvorsky for Gizmodo. Two sets of tracks made by ancient animals are clearly visible on its surface. By looking at previous studies of the age of the Formation, scientists were able to date the footprints to about 313 million years old, give or take half a million years, per the statement. From what Rowland can make of the tracks, two separate reptilian animals crossed diagonally over this spot. One of the animals was about a foot long, and uses a lateral sequence walk, where the left rear foot moves and then the left front, and then the right rear and the right front and so on, Rowland explains to the Arizona Republic. Scientists cant be sure if the tracks come from two separate animals or the same animal at different times, reports Gizmodo. The second set of tracks are moving slightly faster than the first. Living species of tetrapods\u2015dogs and cats, for example\u2015routinely use a lateral sequence gait when they walk slowly, notes Rowland in the statement. The Bright Angel Trail tracks document the use of this gait very early in the history of vertebrate animals. We previously had no information about that. Around 300 million years ago, what is now Arizona was a coastal plain, with wind blown dunes close to the equator, notes Montanari. As Felicia Fonseca reports for the Associated Press, both the creatures and the sandstone formation predate dinosaurs. As Rowland and co authors write in the study, this find also represents the earliest evidence of amniotes living in sand dunes, predating other evidence by at least 8 million years. Mark Nebel, the paleontology program manager at the Grand Canyon, tells the AP that some of the conclusions in Rowlands study might prove controversial. Theres a lot of disagreement in the scientific community about interpreting tracks, interpreting the age of rocks, especially interpreting what kind of animal made these tracks, says Nebel. Still, Nebel says that the find is an exciting oneespecially because the boulder was lying in plain sight. A lot of people walk by it and never see it, says Nebel. Scientists, we have trained eyes. Now that they know somethings there, it will draw more interest."}, {"title": "This 15-Foot Ichthyosaur Died With a 13-Foot Meal in Its Stomach", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "August 24, 2020", "doc": "When paleontologists dug up a 15 foot marine reptile called an ichthyosaur in southwestern China, they got more than they bargained for. Around 240 million years ago, the same may have been true for the ichthyosaur. The huge marine predator died and fossilized with the entire torso of another 13 foot long swimming reptile called a thalattosaur lodged in its gut, creating the fossil equivalent of nesting Russian dolls, reports Jason Bittel for National Geographic. Its impossible to tell whether the ambitious ichthyosaur was done in by a case of its eyes being bigger than its tummy, but whats for sure is that we didnt understand the ichthyosaur diet quite as well as we thought we did. The ichthyosaurs teeth are peg like and not terribly sharp, which paleontologists thought meant it chowed down on soft, slippery prey like cephalopods. Now we have really solid evidence saying these blunt teeth can be used to eat something big, Ryosuke Motani, a paleobiologist at the University of California, Davis and lead author of a new study of the fossil, tells Maria Temming for Science News. That means the other species with similar teeth we discounted before  may be megapredators too. Instead of sawing through large prey with sharp, serrated teeth similar to those seen on modern great white sharks, the ichthyosaur may have ripped its prey apart more like orcas or crocodiles, which also have cone shaped teeth. The extraordinary fossil was first unearthed in 2010 in the Guizhou province in southwestern China. The ichthyosaur is of the genus Guizhouichthyosaurus and would have looked something like a large dolphin with long slender jaws. The slightly shorter and much slimmer thalattosaur, called Xinpusaurus xingyiensis, was more like a giant swimming lizard with four paddle like limbs. The researchers, who published their findings last week in the journal iScience, say they cant be certain whether the ichthyosaur killed the thalattosaur or merely scavenged it. However, the fact that such a large, contiguous morsel of the meal is permanently bulging out of the predators stomach may tip the scales. If a predator other than Guizhouichthyosaurus killed the thalattosaur in question, then it would be strange for the nutritious trunk and limbs to be left intact by the predator, the team writes in the paper. Another fossil that appears to be the discarded tail of the thalattosaur was found in sediments nearby, according to a statement. Nick Fraser, a palaeontologist at National Museums Scotland who was not involved with the study, tells Nicola Davis of the Guardian that the paper presents a convincing case that Xinpusaurus was Guizhouichthyosaurus last meal and that the ichthyosaur probably made the kill itself. In any event, I think it is clear that it was a step too far for the ichthyosaur, Fraser tells the Guardian. As such this might represent a rather uncommon event in a day in the life of a Triassic marine reptile. But it does rather magically bring to life a cameo of animal interactions in the seas approximately 230 million years ago."}, {"title": "Five Places Where You Can Collect Fossils in the D.C. Area", "author": "Rachael Lallensack", "date": "August 20, 2020", "doc": "About 20 million years ago, the land thats now Virginia, Maryland and the nations capital Washington, D.C. was underwater. Where monuments now stand, giant megalodon shark hunted down prehistoric whales and dolphins and fish darted through coral. The marks these creatures left on the world havent washed away, as folks stumble on fossil evidence of their ancient lives all the time. The Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History boasts fossils from all around the world, and yet plenty come from the area surrounding the museum itself. Theres a Miocene era baleen whale skull on display that was found in the Calvert Cliffs in Maryland, for example. A giant Megalodon replica hangs from the atrium in the cafe a nearby plaque explains that you can still find Meg teeth on the shores of the Chesapeake Bay. For amateur fossil hunters dreaming of coming across a megalodon tooth on the beach, weve curated a list of fossil hot spots just a hop, skip and jump from the Natural History Museum. Perhaps the most well known fossil site on the east coast, the Calvert Cliffs cover about 24 miles of shoreline in Maryland. More than 600 species of fossils, including prehistoric oyster shells, mollusks and scallops as well as shark teeth, have been found on the shores. You might even find a megalodon toothmost likely, however, youll find smaller teeth of other kinds of ancient sharks. Most finds date back to the Miocene era, or around 15 million years ago. You might be wondering why it is so easy to find shark teeth millions of years old on the beach. According to Smithsonian marine paleobiologist David Bohaska, sharks lose their teeth and regrow new ones constantly. In its lifetime, he explains, a single shark can have thousands and thousands of teeth. One location where you can access the cliffs is at Calvert Cliffs State Park in Lusby, Maryland. Just a 1.8 mile walk from the parking lot, you can scour the open beach area with a small shovel and sievethese youll need to bring yourselffor remnants of prehistoric sea life. Dont bring a hammer or bang on rocks as this will only damage the fossil, Bohaska advises. The cliffs are layered at a slant, so youll find fossils from different geologic time periods depending on where you are. The layers at the top are the more recent chapters and the stuff at the bottom is older, Bohaska explains. He warns that it is illegal to climb on the cliffs or search beneath them in this area, so pay attention to signage. Youre out in the wild, be aware, says Bohaska. If you look at the cliff and it has a crack, or if theres a tree overhanging, thats not a place you want to stand.\n\nYou can find lots of in depth information about where to look for fossils and how to determine what you found on the Maryland Geological Survey website. You can also download Smithsonian Scholarly Press The Geology and Vertebrate Paleontology of Calvert Cliffs, Maryland, USA online. Be sure to plan ahead for filled to capacity closures on busy holiday weekends like Labor Day. And pack your mask The Maryland Park Service requires face coverings in public buildings and outdoor public spaces wherever social distancing is not possible. In 1717, Virginia colonist and politician Thomas Lee purchased Stratford Hall, a 1,200 acre property in Stratford, Virginia. About 17 million years earlier, during the Miocene era, however, the Stratford Hall estates towering 150 foot high cliffs were actually part of the seafloor, according to its website. In 2013, amateur paleontologist Jon Bachmanwho serves as Stratford Halls educational events coordinatorfound a 15 million year old whale skull on the shores of the Potomac River at the four generation Lee family home, where Robert E. Lee was born in 1807. The six foot long, 1,000 pound fossil was unearthed when the banks of the river eroded that summer. The skull was the biggest found near the cliffs, but theres plenty more where that came from, including shark toothed porpoises, salt water crocodiles, sea cows, gopher turtles and rays, according to Stratford Halls website. The cliffs still turn loose small fossils as they erode. As sediment accumulated for millions of years, the ocean underwent a series of marine transgressions, meaning that over a long period of time, the shoreline receded and advanced several times. Each time that movement happened a new layer of sediment was dumped, and those layers can be seen as one looks up at the cliffs. The back and forth of the ocean created the right environment to preserve the remains of countless animals, Bachman explains. Now, as the river current scours the cliffs, these fossils are exposed and slowly emerge out of the cliffs. Thats what people want to find. Today, the waterline at the Stratford cliffs is about 16 million years old, Bachman says. Due to irresponsible fossil hunting practices, however, visitors must purchase a grounds pass 8 for adults and 5 for kids to access a small, well marked, 100 yard long collecting area on the beach. The Hall still offers guided collecting tours led by one of their Paleo Patrol volunteers, explains Alex Withers, an events coordinator at Stratford Hall. Tours are typically about four hours long. Withers notes there is limited weekend tour availability left in the 2020 season, but they are taking reservations for 2021. You can read up about their COVID 19 guidelines on their website. Bachman, who used to be a fourth grade teacher in Virginias Prince William County, says making fossil collecting a lifelong hobby is a worthwhile adventure. It takes patience, this stuff isnt littering the ground, he says. Its humbling and fascinating hobby. Start with reviewing the principles of geology, Bachman suggests. Then move on to studying the geology in your area, which will tell you what rock formation and landscape features are nearbyand therefore, what fossils might be found there. State geologic societies have useful information on their websites. Its just a delight and you dont have to get a degree in it to enjoy it, he adds. You can educate yourself in stages. Its about familiarizing yourself with the landscape around us. About 70 miles south of the Natural History Museum, Westmoreland State Parks Fossil Beach is another hotbed for prehistoric shark teeth, but whats really eye catching about the location is the stratigraphyor rocky layersof the cliffs. Gazing up at the cliffs stripes is like looking 25 million years back in time each layer represents millions of years of geologic history. Fossil Beach neighbors Stratford Hall, so the geology in both areas is similar. The river current erodes the sediment and fossilized material washes up on the beach, explains Bachman, who lives nearby and collects fossils at this location. Bachmans wife, Dianne, recently found the lower part of a leg bone, which they later found out may belong to a Miocene pseudo toothed pelican, Pelagornis miocaenus, after having their colleague Robert Weems, a paleontologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, take a look. The bone is about six inches long and hollow, much like bird bones are today. People probably stepped over it a million times, says Bachman.  The area was once home to the unique prehistoric whale species, Eobalaenoptera harrisoni. A model of the 14 million year old baleen whale hangs in the Caroline County visitors center just a short drive from Fossil Beach. When the original fossil was excavated in the 1990s, researchers recovered half of the full skeleton, making it one of the most complete and largest prehistoric whale skeletons in the U.S. The skeleton is housed in the Virginia Museum of Natural History in Martinsville. During the pandemic, face coverings are required in all park facilities and where social distancing is not possible, according to the parks website. Virginia State Parks also recommends bringing your own soap and hand sanitizer. Of course, respect social distancing and keep a six foot space between yourself and others. Step aside to let others pass on trails. Just over an hours drive south of D.C., Purse State Park is located on a stretch of the banks of the Potomac River called Wades Bay. Paleontologist Michelle Pinsdorf of Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History says most of the fossils youll find at this site are from the late Paleocenespecifically the Aquia Formation rock layer, which is 55 to 59 million years old. During this time period, many types of animals were evolving and diversifying to adapt to the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous time period, Pinsdorf writes in an email to Smithsonian magazine. Because the deposit is marine in origin, the teeth of a wide variety of shark and bony fish species can be found in this formation. Alongside shark teeth, you may find an occasional prehistoric crocodile tooth, which by comparison sort of look like an ice cream cone with an almost silky texture, says Bohaska. Youll also spot plenty of fossilized shells. Pinsdorf says prehistoric oyster shells are among her favorite finds at Purse State Park. Although they are heavily eroded and dont have much of the shell pattern or shape left, they are a beautiful purple color and have an interesting luster and smooth texture, she says. The ideal time to search is during low tide when there is enough shoreline to scour. But if you go in the days after a storm or rough waters, youre more likely to find fossils that have recently eroded out of the bedrock, and are in better condition as a result, explains Pinsdorf. The trails are unmarked so its important to carry a compass and map, according to Marylands tourism department. Pinsdorf suggests taking a quarter mile trail westward, across the road from the Parks parking area on Route 224 Riverside Road, to a narrow stretch of beach along Wades Bay. Bringing a colander or mesh screen is recommended to aid in sifting the gravel, in which small but numerous shark teeth and can be found, she says. Larger, weathered oyster shell fragments are present at this site also. During the coronavirus pandemic, face coverings are required in park buildings and outdoor areas where social distancing is not possible. Some parks have introduced additional cleaning procedures for restrooms or closed public restrooms. Others may be offering portable bathrooms instead, according to Marylands Department of Natural Resources. Originally a prime site for iron mining, African American miners in 1858 were the first to discover dinosaur fossils at this site. Geologist Philip Thomas Tyson brought the fossilized bones from the mines to a scientific conference in 1859, where they were officially identified as dinosaur remains. Its a place where people have been working for a few hundred years, explains paleontologist Matt Carrano of Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. If the area where Dinosaur Park now stands hadnt been mined at all, it would look like a normal Maryland hillside covered in vegetation. Its only a good spot for fossil collecting because it was mined for so long, he says. Youre looking at bedrock where there should be soil. Today, Dinosaur Park features fossilized dino bones, including some from Marylands state dinosaur Astrodon johnstoni, and floral remnants from the early Cretaceous period about 115 million years ago. At the time, the region would have resembled something like a swampy bayou with muddy streams. According to Carrano, the sediment was a very fine, almost pottery quality, clay like material. Youre walking on a clay layer that was deposited 110 million years ago, Carrano says. Now, when it rains, the clay absorbs the water and then dries out again, revealing fossil fragments in that process. The most common finds are plant material, like wood and pine cones. Every now and then the conditions are just right and you get a situation when the environment is saving things instead of recycling them, Carrano explains.  Due to COVID 19, all public programs and fossil collecting at Dinosaur Park are currently on hold, but the park area is open from sunrise to sunset. The unrestricted area features a Cretaceous era garden and a climbable dinosaur skeleton. Signs describe the kinds of dinosaurs that once roamed the area, what Marylands prehistoric environment looked like and the African American history in the area, according to the parks website. Dinosaur Park usually serves as an outdoor laboratory, where the public can work alongside paleontologists to help uncover the past on the first and third Saturdays of the month or by appointment. Hundreds of fossils discovered by visitors have been collected and cataloged to date, enhancing our knowledge about the ancient ecosystem that once existed here. Theres a steady stream of new discoveries, Carrano says. Were in this phase when the variety is much greater than we knew, just because we didnt have much collected from the area. Many times, youll know you have something new, but you dont have enough of it to give it a new name."}, {"title": "30-Foot \u2018Terror Crocodile\u2019 Ambushed Dinosaurs at Water\u2019s Edge", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "August 14, 2020", "doc": "Even the mighty dinosaurs may have lived in fear of the giant extinct crocodilian Deinosuchus, whose name translates to terror crocodile. These monstrous swamp dwellers reached lengths of more than 30 feet, weighed as much as 8,000 pounds and delivered bone crushing bites with teeth the size of bananas, reports Johnny Diaz for the New York Times. Now, research published this week in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology revisits fossil specimens of the fearsome creature and reveals new details about their reign over the swamps of Late Cretaceous North America. Despite their name, terror crocodiles are actually more closely related to modern alligators. But that doesnt mean they simply looked like goliath gators, or crocodiles for that matter. Deinosuchus snout was long and broad with a strangely bulbous nose that featured two additional holes positioned in front of its nostrils, according to the paper. The researchers arent sure why Deinosuchus had such a honking nose or what those extra holes were for. Most people think crocodiles havent changed in 75 million years, Adam Cossette, a paleobiologist at the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine of Arkansas State University and the papers lead author, tells Gabriela Saldivia of NPR. This study shows that the ancestors of todays American alligator didnt look anything like them. After studying the tooth studded maws of these unfamiliar looking reptilian giants, Cossette tells the Times hes confident they would have posed a credible threat to the huge dinosaurs that walked the Earth at the time. This finding broadens the prior understanding of the animals feeding habits, which had been assumed to be more opportunistic than selective. Poring over Deinosuchus remains also revealed that there were not one but three species that lived across North America between 75 million and 82 million years ago, reports Allen Kim for CNN. Two species, Deinosuchus hatcheri and Deinosuchus riograndensis, occupied the west from modern day Montana to northern Mexico. The third lay in wait in the Atlantic coastal plain from New Jersey to Mississippi. Some of them were separated by a seaway that at one point cut North America in half from whats now the Gulf of Mexico up to the Arctic Ocean, Christopher Brochu, a paleontologist at the University of Iowa and the studys co author, tells NPR. And that may have driven what we call speciation. There might have been one ancestral Deinosuchus form in North America, and then the seaway cut that population in half and on one side it evolved in one direction, the other side in a different direction. Mark A. Norell, the curator and chair of paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History, tells the Times the new findings highlight how much there is left to learn about these creatures, which are rare and understudied. Usually their collection and study is an afterthought, he tells the Times, as most work done on these formations and deposits is dominated by dinosaurs."}, {"title": "Climate Change, Not Hunting, May Have Doomed the Woolly Rhinoceros", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "August 13, 2020", "doc": "Some 30,000 years ago, the hulking woolly rhinoceros and its curved, three foot long horn inspired ancient humans to streak the limestone walls of Chauvet Cave in southern France with vivid charcoal portraits of the Ice Age beast. But were humans artistic renderings of the woolly rhino accompanied by hunting that drove the creatures extinct roughly 14,000 years ago? The explanation for the demise of Ice Age megafauna, including the woolly mammoth, giant sloth and saber toothed cat, has been debated for decades. Many researchers have proposed that the mammals were hunted into extinction by Homo sapiens in whats been termed the overkill hypothesis. Now, in research published today in Current Biology, scientists who analyzed the animals DNA suggest that it may have been the planets swiftly changing climate that undid the species. Humans are well known to alter their environment and so the assumption is that if it was a large animal it would have been useful to people as food and that must have caused its demise, says Edana Lord, a graduate student at the Centre for Palaeogentics and co first author of the paper. But our findings highlight the role of rapid climate change in the woolly rhinos extinction. The woolly rhino was a fur matted fortress of a creature that grazed across the dry, frigid steppe ecosystem of northern Eurasia, including modern day France but particularly in Siberia, for hundreds of thousands of years. They were roughly the same size as the white rhinos of today, which can reach up to five tons. Scientists speculate that woolly rhinos used their horns, which are thinner and more blade like than those of living rhinos, to sweep away snow and nibble at frost crusted tufts of greenery. But suddenly, around 14,000 years ago the woolly rhino died out. Humans are thought to have first made their way to the rhinos Siberian stronghold around 30,000 years ago, meaning they overlapped with woolly rhinos for some 16,000 years. The animals last centuries of existence coincided with a sudden and severe warming event called the B\u00f8llingAller\u00f8d interstadial, which began around 14,700 years ago. During this roughly 2,000 year period of warmth, the meltwater gushing from the planets immense ice sheets raised sea level by approximately 50 feet. For the papers senior author Love Dalen, a paleogeneticist at Stockholm University and the Swedish Museum of Natural History, the goal was to establish when the woolly rhinos population started to decline and what that lined up with. Did the decline start 30,000 years ago when humans appeared, says Dalen. Or 14,000 years ago when we know the planet went through a period of rapid warming? To find out when that decline likely began, Dalen and his colleagues needed good quality samples of woolly rhino DNA. The ancient animals DNA would reveal how inbred or genetically diverse the woolly rhino was, which would allow researchers to infer when the population started shrinking before going extinct. Finding samples meant scientists spent years tramping around the increasingly sodden Siberian permafrost to track down pieces of bone, tissue and hair from specimens. They then screened those samples to find the ones with the most pristine genetic material. The team selected and sequenced the mitochondrial genomes of 14 samples that included a baby woolly rhino found mummified in the permafrost with much of its hide intact and from a scrap of rhino meat recovered from the stomach of an Ice Age puppy found with its internal organs intact. Animal cells contain both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. While most of the cells DNA is contained in the nucleus, the mitochondria also has its own DNA. These short, maternally inherited lengths of genetic code are easier to sequence but provide less information about ancestry than the much larger nuclear genome. Still, the multiple samples of mitochondrial DNA would allow the researchers to expand and corroborate results gleaned from a nuclear genome, which is considered more reliable because it contains fewer mutations. To sequence the woolly rhinos nuclear genome, Dalen needed a sample that carried relatively intact and unfragmented strings of genetic code and low levels of contamination from the bacterial DNA that often dominates ancient cells. The researchers finally settled on an 18,500 year old humerus found in the Arctic Chukotka region of Russia. But to know how to piece together the disordered fragments of the woolly rhinos ancient nuclear genome the researchers needed whats called a reference genome, a genome from a modern relative of the extinct species being sequenced. The scientists sequenced the woolly rhinos closest living relative, the endangered Sumatran rhino. Dalen estimates the two species share nearly 99 percent of the same DNA, and, because theyre so genetically similar, the team was able to use the properly arranged Sumatran rhino genome to figure out how to arrange the recovered fragments of woolly rhino DNA. The 18,500 year old bone showed strong genetic diversity, indicating that the species population was relatively stable and was missing the duplicate sections of genetic code that result from inbreeding. This was a healthy individual in terms of genetic diversity, which leads us to believe that the decline in population leading up to the woolly rhinos extinction must have happened rapidly sometime between 18,500 years ago and 14,000 years ago, says Lord. This paper shows that woolly rhino coexisted with people for millennia without any significant impact on their population, says Grant Zazula, a paleontologist for Canadas Yukon territory and Simon Fraser University who was not involved in the research. Then all of a sudden the climate changed and they went extinct. This doesnt prove that human hunting didnt help extinguish the woolly rhino, cautions Dalen. Its possible that either human populations or human hunting capabilities reached some crucial tipping point in the 4,500 years his teams data doesnt cover. But the more likely explanation, says Dalen, is that the massive change in climate during the B\u00f8llingAller\u00f8d interstadial drove the rhino into oblivion. I personally dont think that the increase in temperature in itself was a big problem for the rhinos, but what that warming does is increase precipitation, says Dalen. An increase in precipitation would have resulted in more snow. If the snow was many feet deep, it may have put the grasses out of reach of the rhinos, placing them in danger of starvation. Eventually, the warmer, wetter climate would have transformed the steppe ecosystem the woolly rhino depended on from grasslands to shrubs to more forests. Kay Behrensmeyer, the curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, isnt totally convinced that climate change alone slayed the woolly rhino. Extinction doesnt usually have a single cause, she says, but instead occurs when a range of factors critical to a species existence reach a tipping point. She says that even with a scant 4,500 year window, human hunting and climate change may have each played a role in the rhinos doom. Lord and Dalen say they hope to find more recent samples with high quality DNA so they can probe the millennia just prior to the loss of the woolly rhino. Zazula says even if the final word on the woolly rhinoceros adds human hunting to the mix, the massive changes wrought by Earths fickle climate not so long ago should be a lesson for our species to tread more carefully in the present. It only takes a short period of warming to drive cold adapted species extinct, he says. That rapid warming at the end of the Ice Age is similar to what were seeing now and it could have similarly devastating consequences for Arctic species today."}, {"title": "Study Reveals This Mysterious, Super Long-Necked Triassic Reptile Was a Marine Hunter", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "August 11, 2020", "doc": "New research reveals that a mysterious long necked reptile from the dawn of the age of the dinosaurs was a marine predator, reports Nicola Davis for the Guardian. Paleontologists uncovered the creatures bones in Germany more than 100 years ago, but until now one of the only things researchers knew for sure about the extinct reptile Tanystropheus was that it had a ridiculously long neck. Specimens ranged in size from roughly four feet to 20 feet long but all had a rigid neck around triple the length of their torso, according to the Guardian. The divergent sizes and unique physiology of the Tanystropheus specimens that emerged from 242 million year old Triassic sediments in Europe sowed debate as to how the fossils should be interpreted, reports Michael Marshall for New Scientist. Is it terrestrial or is it marine? Are those juveniles and adults, or are they two different species? Olivier Rieppel, curator of evolutionary biology at the Field Museum of Natural History and co author of the new research, tells New Scientist. In a bid to answer some of these lingering questions, Rieppel and colleagues used computerized tomography to create a 3 D scan of the crushed skull of one of the larger Tanystropheus specimens. This technique allowed the team to reposition each digitized skull fragment and put the skull back together into something closer to its original shape. Writing in the journal Current Biology, the researchers report that the digitally un crushed skull revealed nostrils positioned on top of the snouta trait that facilitates easy breathing in aquatic animalsand pointed, interlocking teeth suited to snagging slippery fish and squid. Speaking with New Scientist, Rieppel adds that biomechanically, that neck doesnt make sense on land. To figure out if the more diminutive examples of Tanystropheus were just Triassic tykes, the researchers sliced into some of the smaller specimens bones. The growth lines inside the bones, which can be used to age animals much like the rings of a tree, suggested the individual was an adult. This finding means there were not one but two species of aquatic, long necked reptile plying the waters off Pangea, reports Laura Geggel for Live Science. The researchers dubbed the larger species Tanystropheus hydroides after the serpentine necked sea monster Hydra of Greek mythology, and the smaller species retains the name Tanystropheus longobardicus, which previously covered all specimens. Though the animals had similarly long, stiff necks, the creatures were so different in size and dentition that they probably werent competing for the same food sources. They had evolved to feed on different food sources with different skulls and teeth, but with the same long neck, Stephan Spiekman, a paleontologist at the University of Zurich and lead author of the study, tells Live Science. In a statement, Spiekman adds, the small species likely fed on small shelled animals, like shrimp, in contrast to the fish and squid the large species ate. This is really remarkable, because we expected the bizarre neck of Tanystropheus to be specialized for a single task, like the neck of a giraffe. But actually, it allowed for several lifestyles. This completely changes the way we look at this animal. The new knowledge gleaned from this research can now be used to classify newly discovered fossils. We have found the same genus, Tanystropheus, in China, Nick Fraser, a paleontologist at National Museums Scotland and co author of the new research, tells the Guardian. Our issue there is going to be which species does the Chinese one belong to."}, {"title": "Amber Fossil Shows \u2018Hell Ant\u2019 Was Unlike Anything Alive Today", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "August 10, 2020", "doc": "Some 99 million years ago an ant unlike any alive today was in the midst of a savage scythe jawed attack when dripping plant resin froze the insect, along with its prey, in a final predatory tableau. Now, new research based on this amber tinted window into the Cretaceous confirms that so called hell ants made a killing with the help of recurved mandibles that swung upward, pinning or even impaling prey against a horn like protrusion sticking out of its forehead, reports Lucy Hicks for Science. Hell ants have two features found in no living species highly specialized scythe like mandibles and a wide diversity of horns that are present on what is essentially the forehead, Phillip Barden, a paleontologist at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and lead author of the paper, tells Katie Hunt of CNN. Paleontologists have long suspected that unique mouthparts of the 16 known species of hell ant hinged shut vertically, rather than horizontally as is the case in all living ant species. But the newly described specimen is the first hard evidence that this is indeed how these early ants sharp jaws functioned, the researchers report this week in the journal Current Biology. The only way for prey to be captured in such an arrangement is for the ant mouthparts to move up and downward in a direction unlike that of all living ants and nearly all insects, Barden says in a statement. The hunk of amber containing this ancient drama was first unearthed in 2017 in Myanmar. The region has produced a trove of mind blowing fossils but armed conflict has tied the amber trade to horrifying human rights violations, leading many to avoid dealing with fossils from the region, as Joshua Sokol reported for Science in 2019. The authors of the current research note that the fossil originated in Myanmars Kachin State but was deposited in the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences prior to the 2017 military control of some mine regions...All authors declare that the fossil reported in this study was not involved in armed conflict and ethnic strife in Myanmar. The particular hell ant locked inside this fossilized amber is Ceratomyrmex ellenbergeri and its prey, which has its head smashed between the ants jaws, is a cockroach relative called Caputoraptor elegans. Once the prey was gripped in this way, the ant most probably moved on to an immobilizing stingwe know that the stings of hell ants were well developed, Barden tells Hannah Osborne of Newsweek. Speaking with Mindy Weisberger of Live Science, Barden hypothesizes the gruesome fate that may have awaited the cockroach nymph after being paralyzed by the ants sting They have these highly specialized mouthparts that are so exaggerated they cant feed themselves. Instead, they feed the prey to their own larvaeand the larvae have unspecialized mouthparts, so they can chew normally. After the pale larvae have had their fill, Barden suggests the adult hell ants might make small incisions in the larvaes soft bodies and drink the next generations blood called hemolymph in insects. Basically, they use their own siblings and offspring as a social digestive system, Barden tells Live Science. We dont have direct evidence thats the case here, but that could be something thats going on. For those alarmed by Bardens imagination, the inspiration for this grisly scene is a living species called the Dracula ant. Hell ants are among the earliest known ants, but what remains a mystery is why they, along with their unique jaws, died out roughly 65 million years ago after some 20 million years of roaming the planet, while the relatives of modern ants persisted and flourished. Over 99 of all species that have ever lived have gone extinct, Barden says in the statement. As our planet undergoes its sixth mass extinction event, its important that we work to understand extinct diversity and what might allow certain lineages to persist while others drop out. I think fossil insects are a reminder that even something as ubiquitous and familiar as ants have undergone extinction."}, {"title": "Dinosaurs Suffered From Cancer, Too", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "August 3, 2020", "doc": "In most cases, paleontologists are at least 66 million years too late to give dinosaurs medical exams. The living animals perished long, long ago. But every now and then, fossil hunters uncover a bone with signs of injury or diseasewhat experts call pathologies. And in the case of a particular bone found in the roughly 75 million year old rock of Alberta, a medical examination has revealed that dinosaurs suffered from a cancer that afflicts humans today. A multidisciplinary team led by a paleontologist and a pathologist studied the bone inside and out, examining everything from the outside shape to the inner microscopic structure. In the end, the experts arrived at a diagnosis of osteosarcomaa malignant bone cancer that afflicts about 3.4 out of every million people worldwide. The teams new study, published today in The Lancet, provides the most detailed evidence yet for cancer in a dinosaur. Discovering osteosarcoma in a dinosaur has implications for the evolutionary origins and history of cancer. If humans and dinosaurs get the same kinds of bone cancers, says George Washington University paleontologist Catherine Forster, then bone cancers developed deep in evolutionary history, before the mammal and reptile lineages split 300 million years ago. The pivotal bone wasnt an isolated find, but part of an enormous bonebed containing the remains of dozens upon dozens of the horned dinosaur Centrosaurus. A huge herd of these horned dinosaurs perished together, probably in a flash flood that ripped along an ancient coast. The Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology excavated the site in 1989, and among their finds was a fibula, or lower leg bone, that looked strange. The bone showed some kind of injury, perhaps a healed fracture, and was filed away in the museums collections. Years later, Royal Ontario Museum paleontologist David Evans happened to meet McMaster University pathology specialist Mark Crowther at a social event. The two got to talking about bone cancer in dinosaurs, and, Evans recalls, I said that our best shot to find dino cancer was to go to the Royal Tyrrell Museum collections and search through their large holdings of pathological dinosaur bones. Evans and Crowthers search paid off. The researchers pored over the Royal Tyrrell collections with other experts in both dinosaurs and disease. The team surveyed hundreds of fossils and rediscovered the Centrosaurus bone. The injury to the bone didnt look like a break. It looked like a good candidate for Cretaceous cancer. Experts in musculoskeletol oncology and human pathology examined the bone in detail, from its outer physical appearance to its inner structure using a high resolution X ray CT scan, and confirmed a diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Other paleontologists have found cancer in dinosaur bones before, but, Evans notes, this is the first time a malignant cancer has been confirmed through multiple lines of evidence. The images in the new study appear to represent a tumor, says Montana State University paleopathologist Ewan Wolff, but he adds I would like to see comparison to animals more closely related to dinosaurs. Living dinosaursbirdswill be key to further testing the conclusion and identifying other cases. Osteosarcoma has been found in birds from robins to pelicans, Wolff points out, and these avian comparison points may help refine our understanding of how osteosarcoma has affected dinosaurs through time. When paleontologists see little blips and bumps on dinosaur bones, we often just assume that it must have been from a traumatic injury, says Andrew Farke of the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology. By contrast, Farke says, the new research provides a high level of evidence for the cancer diagnosis and offers a reminder to paleontologists to check their assumptions about paleopathologies. The diagnosis was definitely bad news for the Centrosaurus. Malignant cancers are aggressive and can spread to other parts of the body, and as such they are often fatal, Evans says. In this case, the bone cancer appears so advanced that it had likely spread to other points in the body. Not that this dinosaur perished because of its illness. The Centrosaurus died in a coastal flood as part of a massive herd. The fact that the dinosaur survived for so long might tell us something about the benefits of dinosaur social life. Large tyrannosaurs such as Daspletosaurus fed on Centrosaurus. Much like many modern predatorsfrom hyenas to sharksdinosaurian carnivores probably picked off sick or injured animals that were easier to catch. However, Evans says, living within a large herd provided safety in numbers and likely allowed it to avoid predation as the cancer progressed, allowing it to survive longer with this debilitating cancer than it would have on its own. When afflicted by illness, Farke notes, animals are often much tougher than we think they are. Still, herding may have offered benefits to the injured. If you are a sick horned dinosaur, being able to blend in with others of your kind will probably buy you some time versus being out solo, he says. While this discovery is, as yet, a single occurrence, the find helps to paint a richer picture of dinosaur lives. Dinosaurs can seem like mythical creatures, but they were living, breathing animals that suffered through horrible injuries and diseases, Evans says, and this discovery certainly makes them more real and helps bring them to life in that respect."}, {"title": "This Marsupial Sabertooth Was No Killer Cat", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "July 31, 2020", "doc": "The extinct saber toothed cat Smilodon fatalis prowled Pleistocene North America sporting seven inch, blade like canines that paleontologists say may have allowed it to slit gaping wounds across throats and bellies to swiftly bleed out its prey, reports Riley Black for National Geographic. Understandably, when paleontologists discovered an ancient Argentine marsupial the size of a leopard with fangs that were even larger, relative to its body size, they assumed its huge canines were also for slashing and impaling writhing prey. But now, new research suggests that the marsupial sabertooth, Thylacosmilus atrox, was more likely a scavenger than a death dealing predator. Thylacosmilus didnt just carry its young inside a pouch like modern marsupials, it also kept its saber teeth sheathed by bony protrusions from its lower jaw that may have protected the fangs when its mouth was closed, reports Matt Kaplan for the New York Times. The re evaluation of how Thylacosmilus made its living as a carnivore came from an array of observations regarding its anatomy that appeared to have been lost in the shadow cast by the creatures fearsome looking teeth. Those big canines had everyone mesmerized, nobody seemed to notice that they were actually shaped like claws rather than blades. We almost named the paper Blinded by the Tooth, Christine Janis, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol and lead author of the new research, tells the Times. Janis and her co authors published An eye for a tooth Thylacosmilus was not a marsupial saber tooth predator last month in the journal PeerJ. Besides the triangular, claw shape of the marsupials teeth in cross section it also lacked upper incisors, which would have filled the space between the canines. According to Janis, those upper incisors are essential tools for scraping meat from bone in todays big cats as well as Smilodon. Moreover, the two sides of Thylacosmilus lower jaw werent even fused together by bone. To get a clearer idea of what Thylacosmilus fangs might have been good for, the team conducted biomechanical studies comparing them to Smilodon. Previous studies by other researchers have shown Thylacosmilus to have had a weaker bite than Smilodon, says Stephan Lautenschlager, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who worked on the analyses, in a statement. But what we can show is there was probably a difference in behaviour between the two species Thylacosmilus skull and canines are weaker in a stabbing action than those of Smilodon, but are stronger in a pull back type of action. This suggests that Thylacosmilus was not using its canines to kill with, but perhaps instead to open carcasses. The wear and tear on Thylacosmilus molars also didnt match up with the patterns seen on modern big cats or Smilodon, per the Times. Instead of shearing meat from bone, the tooth surfaces of Thylacosmilus suggest it was eating very soft food. Thylacosmilus is not simply a marsupial version of a saber tooth cat, Larisa DeSantis, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University and co author of the paper, tells National Geographic. Hans Dieter Sues, a paleontologist at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History and who was not involved in the research, says the new findings show that even striking similarities in form, especially in species that are not closely related, must be examined in detail before scientists can infer similarity in function. DeSantis tells National Geographic that the evidence suggests the ecology of Thylacosmilus may have been very different than anything alive todaya carnivore that specialized on soft organs. In the statement, Janis says that this preference for guts may have also been facilitated by a large tongue It may have employed those canines to open carcasses and perhaps also used a big tongue to help extract the innards other mammals that have lost the incisors, like walruses and anteaters, also have big tongues that they use in feeding. But some other researchers think painting Thylacosmilus as an organ slurper might be a stretch. Speaking with the Times, Blaire Van Valkenburgh, a paleontologist at the University of California, Los Angeles says she is willing to entertain the notion that Thylacosmilus was a scavenger, but calling it a specialist organ feeder may be going a bit far. And though Van Valkenburgh tells the Times she had the same thought concerning the extinct creatures potentially prodigious tongue, she laments I am not sure how we could ever confirm this."}, {"title": "Woolly Mammoth Skeleton With Intact Ligaments Found in Siberian Lake", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "July 29, 2020", "doc": "Reindeer herders in northern Siberia have discovered the skeleton of a woolly mammoth whose ligaments remain intact at least 10,000 years after its death, reports the Associated Press. Scientists pulled parts of the mammoths skull, ribs and footsome still held together by soft tissuefrom the muck of Pechevalavato Lake in the Yamalo Nenets district of Russia on July 23, according to Reuters. The team is currently searching the site in hopes of uncovering more of the regions extinct fauna. Based on initial findings, the whole skeleton is there, Dmitry Frolov, director of the Arctic Research Centre, tells the Siberian Times Anna Liesowska, who was the first to report on the discovery. Judging by the pictures this was a young mammoth, but well have to wait for tests to give the exact age. The mammothdocumented in Siberian Times photographs of a foots well preserved soft tissue, as well as enormous bones strewn on the lakes shoresis the latest prehistoric creature to emerge from the regions rapidly thawing permafrost after spending millennia locked in frozen soil. In recent years, researchers have identified a 42,000 year old foal with no signs of external damage, a 32,000 year old wolf head and an extinct cave lion cub, among other stunningly well preserved finds. Last month, a historic heatwave struck Siberia with temperatures of up to 18 degrees Fahrenheit above average, according to the World Meteorological Organization. The region has experienced wild temperature swings beforefrom 90 below zero in winter to 90 degrees Fahrenheit in summerand thanks to human driven climate change, blistering heat waves are becoming increasingly likely. Rising temperatures and melting permafrost have even spawned an illicit industry bone hunting. As Andrew Roth reported for the Guardian in 2019, hunters and prospectors have been digging and even diving for ancient ivory tusks loosened from the permafrosts grip, creating a market worth an estimated 50 million each year. Mammoths went extinct some 10,000 years ago, per the AP, but scientists suspect that small groups in Alaska and Wrangel Island off the coast of Siberia may have persisted for slightly longer. This means the newly discovered remains are at least 10,000 years old. Researchers have previously found mammoth fossils dated to around 30,000 years ago, according to Reuters. Yevgeniya Khozyainova, a paleontologist at the Shemanovsky Institute in Salekhard, tells Reuters that the team hopes to find more of the mammoths skeleton. Whenever there is soft tissue left behind, it is valuable material to study, she explains. Even if the rest of the animals skeleton is hidden nearby, researchers say it will take significant time and special equipment to recover, reports the AP. In a television interview quoted by the news agency, Khozyainova notes that complete mammoth skeletons are rare.

The difference lies right between their eyes and their nostrils. Of crocodiles living today, only the four crocodile species that live in the Americas have a small bump in the middle of their snouts.  But about seven million years ago, a ten foot long crocodile living in whats now Libya had the same tell tale lump, according to research published in Scientific Reports last week. A fossil skull of the extinct Crocodylus checchiai provides more evidence that crocodiles spread across the world by migrating from Australia, through Africa and finally to South America. The fossil fills a gap between the Nile crocodile in Africa and the four extant American species, University of Turin paleoherpetologist Massimo Delfino says to Science News Carolyn Wilke. The fact that crocodiles live on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean has long puzzled biologists trying to figure out which direction the giant reptiles migrated. Genetic research in 2011 provided molecular evidence that crocodiles migrated from Africa to the Americas, but fossil evidence was scant. The main problem for palaeobiologists is the rarity and fragmentary nature of fossil remains, Delfino and co author David Iurino told the Agence France Presse by email. The fossil described in the new paper is one of four that were first described in the 1930s. Three that were stored in the Natural History Museum in Tripoli, Libya, were lost or destroyed during World War II, according to the Scientific Reports paper. But the researchers found the fourth skull, originally collected in 1939, stored in the Sapienza University of Rome.  This fossil is twice old, Delfino tells Nina Pullano at Inverse, referencing the fact that the skull is millions of years old and had then been forgotten for decades. The researchers used CT scanning to create a 3D model of the inside and outside of the skull for closer study and confirmed the presence of the American crocodile like snout bump. At seven million years old, the C. checchiai skull predates all known crocodile fossils in America, the oldest of which are about five million years old, Lucy Hicks reports for Science magazine. That means that the timeline checks out its possible that C. checchiai may have made their way from Libya to the western coast of Africa, swam across the Atlantic and landed on the shores of South America. The continents were about the same distance apart seven million years ago as they are today, making the journey across the ocean quite a featbut not impossible. The researchers point out in a statement that the Australian marine crocodile has been recorded travelling more than 300 miles in a day. The prehistoric croc may have also bobbed along on one of the oceans surface currents that travel west from Africa to the Americas. Crocodiles are also not the only flightless animal thought to have reached the New World by crossing the Atlantic. As the Inverse reports, a study published in April suggests that on two instances, monkeys made their way across the ocean on floating vegetation. If you think that the monkey can cross the Atlantic Ocean, very probably its much easier to accept that the crocodile can do it, Delfino tells Inverse. Ancient crocodiles had the specialized glands necessary to swim and survive in saltwater and may have snacked on sea turtles along the way. As a changing climate wiped out local species, crocodiles were well adapted to the late Miocene environment and replaced them, the researchers write in the paper. The original crew of ocean crossing crocs may have included many individuals or at least one pregnant female, Science News reports. And after situating themselves in South America, they evolved and diversified into the four species found in the Americas today. Only the American crocodile and American alligator are found in the United States. But whether or not the crocodilians mourn their C. checchiai ancestors is hard to tellthey might just be crocodile tears, after all."}, {"title": "How Dinosaurs Raised Their Young", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "July 24, 2020", "doc": "For more than a century, paleontologists have been confident that all dinosaurs reproduced by laying eggs. After all, no dinosaur gave birth to live young nor do their modern bird descendants, and nesting sites found from Montana to Mongolia indicate that prehistoric dinosaurs laid clutches of sturdy eggs. Slowly, though, new research has begun to change that picture of dino reproduction. Up until now, paleontologists thought that all dinosaurs laid hard shelled eggs. A recent study by University of Calgary paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky and colleagues found that some dinosaurs, like the 73 million year old horned dinosaur Protoceratops and the 215 million year old, long necked dinosaur Mussaurus, laid soft shelled eggs similar to the leathery eggs of some modern reptiles. By mapping out these findings onto the dinosaur family tree, the paper proposes the unexpected idea that all dinosaurs originally initially laid soft shelled eggs. Over time, at least three different lineages independently evolved hard shelled eggs. This research could help to explain why dinosaur eggs are harder to find than many paleontologists would expect because softer eggs would be less likely to fossilize. And working out which dinosaurs laid which types of eggs is important for answering big questions about dinosaur parental care. Thats because no typical dinosaur nest exists. Some species laid lots of round, hard eggs in a pile. Others laid eggs two by two and arranged them carefully. Some eggs are spheres. Some are cone shaped. And as is the case with modern birds, different egg types relate to the ways adult dinosaurs behaved.  Even among only the hard eggs of dinosaurs, there are considerable differences in the architecture of the eggshell, says University of Calgary paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky. Such varied eggshell structure indicates vastly different nest styles, incubation methods, and times between egg laying and hatching. A picture of dinosaur parenting One matter of debate is whether dinosaur parents stuck around and guard their eggs, or, like todays sea turtles, laid them and then left the offspring to fend for themselves. The answer seems to vary by species. For example, consider the parrot like dinosaurs called oviraptorids. Paleontologists have found the gorgeous skeletons preserved in a position where they seem to be sitting over nests of eggs. Its tempting to call this brooding, like living birds, says San Diego Natural History Museum paleontologist Ashley Poust, but were still unsure if that was part of their behavior. Still, the details would indicate that the dinosaurs constructed their nests with care. Scientists know from previous finds that oviraptorids laid two eggs at a time in a clutch of 30 or more. This means that the mother would have to stay with or at least return to the nest, lay her pair of eggs, arrange them carefully in the circle, and bury them appropriately every day for two weeks to a month, Poust says.  Those eggs would have taken months to hatch. While experts are still searching for definitive evidence, parent dinosaurs may have sat with these nests until the hatchling babies pushed their way out of the shells. Also, Zelenitsky notes, researchers have found a large number of oviraptorosaur nests with adult dinosaur skeletons nearby. These dinosaurs were completely obsessed with their eggs, she says. Oviraptorosaurs were not alone. The shovel beaked dinosaur Maiasaura, which means good mother lizard, got its name in part from Marion Brandvolds discovery of a nest containing baby dinosaurs too developed to be newborns. In the excavations and analysis that followed, Maiasaura became one of the earliest and best examples of dinosaurs watching over their offspring for an extended period after hatching. Yet not all dinosaurs were doting parents. For example, the soft eggs that Protoceratops and Mussaurus would have laid, according to the new study, had to be covered so they wouldnt dry out but were too thin to support the weight of a parent. The dinosaurs that laid soft shelled eggs wouldve made nests to cover their hatchlings to be, but probably didnt do anything more than watch over the nest area. The biggest dinosaurs might have done little to look after the next generation. We have shown parental care in distantly related dinosaurs, Poust says, but for some groups, like sauropods, we dont have evidence of post laying care. Sauropods include the long necked giants like Apatosaurus and Brachiosaurus. Paleontologists have found their expansive nesting grounds, including some sites where dinosaurs laid eggs in areas that were warm with geothermal activity, perhaps to incubate the offspring. But researchers have no evidence that the parents stuck around. Long necked dinosaurs buried their eggs carefully, Poust says, but like turtles, the evidence points to little further carea strategy of lay em and leave em. This image doesnt quite evoke the tender nurturing of The Land Before Time. But it makes sense biologically. If giant dinosaurs were nesting in colonies like seagulls and parents remained there until hatching, Zelenitsky says, food resources for the parents would likely dwindle fast. The daily food requirements of large adult dinosaurs may have prevented them from looming over their nests until hatching day. And this, in turn, might help to answer another thorny question. Sticking together At various sites around the world, paleontologists have found bonebeds containing young dinosaurs of the same species. A trio of Triceratops, an array of Alamosaurus, and a squad of Sinornithomimus appear to indicate that young dinosaurs of various species grouped together as they navigated their youth.  Why? More eyes offer a better chance to spot predators, for example. Adolescent dinosaurs forming cross species social groups makes sense given what we know about how harsh life in the Mesozoic could be. Even among Maiasaura, who received better than average parental care, nearly 90 percent of the hatchlings died within the first year. If young dinosaurs could last through those first 365 days, and grow large enough not to be a snack for larger carnivores, they stood a better chance at survival. Perhaps some dinosaurs employed additional parenting strategies, but researches cant say because they have yet to find the evidence. In this case, living birds might offer some examples of what to look for. Some birds nests collectively, with multiple mothers laying in one nest, Poust says. Did the likes of Allosaurus do the same? We know, too, that some birds are brood parasites, meaning they leave their eggs in the nest of a different species, counting on other parents to raise their young. Its not out of the question that some non avian dinosaurs might have tried the technique first, getting another species to take care of their hungry youngster.  Its just a matter of finding the right fossil, Poust says, or re examining old evidence with new eyes."}, {"title": "Giant Extinct Dolphin May Have Hunted Other Whales", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "July 14, 2020", "doc": "New research suggests that an ancient, extinct species of super sized dolphin was a fearsome apex predator akin to modern killer whales, reports Kristen Rogers for CNN. The nearly 16 foot long dolphin Ankylorhiza tiedemani comb. n. lived around 25 million years ago in what is now South Carolina, according to the study published last week in the journal Current Biology. Fossil whales from the Oligocene period 23 million to 33.9 million years ago are rare and offer paleontologists a unique opportunity to clarify the early evolution of whales. Besides its large size, this Oligocene dolphins teeth suggested to researchers it was a formidable foe to prehistoric prey. Ankylorhiza has proportionally large teeth with thickened roots, an adaptation for higher bite force, and the teeth have longitudinal ridges which cut through flesh more efficiently, Robert Boessenecker, a paleontologist at the College of Charleston and the lead author of the new research, tells Jonathan Chadwick of the Daily Mail. Speaking with CNN, Boessenecker says these strong, sharp teeth would have allowed Ankylorhiza to rip apart large bodied prey by violently shaking its head, which is precisely what killer whales do with seals. The extinct dolphin also had incisors that protruded forward like tusks, which might have been used for ramming its victims. Other aspects of the fossil that researchers say show it was adapted to hunting bigger quarry include its shorter, more powerfully built snout, and the alignment of vertebrae in its neck, which, according to the paper, would have granted the beast similar neck mobility to modern killer whales. The researchers write that Ankylorhiza would have been a fast swimmer, meaning it could have chased down and killed other whales and dolphins of the era as well as ancient manatees or sea cows, sea turtles, sea birds, sharks and fish. The first fossil of this speciesa fragmentary skullwas discovered in the 1880s during dredging of South Carolinas Wando River, according to a release, but the first skeleton wasnt found until the 1970s. The nearly complete fossil skeleton that is the subject of the current study was unearthed in the 1990s during excavations related to the construction of a new housing subdivision. Ankylorhiza is a member of the odontocetes or toothed whales, a group that includes modern dolphins, porpoises, killer whales and other species that have teeth, including pilot whales, belugas and sperm whales. The evolutionary paths of odontocetes and the mysticetes, or the baleen whales, which include filter feeding humpbacks and blue whales, diverged at least 36 million years ago. Despite many millions of years of evolving independently, the surviving species of toothed and baleen whales sport many similar adaptations to swimming underwater. Researchers had previously thought these similarities were due to the traits having been present in the two groups last common ancestor. But the new study of the Ankylorhiza fossil suggests each group separately evolved the shared features in parallel. The degree to which baleen whales and dolphins independently arrive at the same overall swimming adaptations, rather than these traits evolving once in the common ancestor of both groups, surprised us, says Boessenecker in a statement. Examples include narrowing the base of the tail, increasing the number of tail vertebrae and shortening the upper arm bone humerus in the flipper, per the statement. This is not apparent in different lineages of seals and sea lions, for example, which evolved into different modes of swimming and have very different looking postcranial skeletons, Boessenecker adds. Its as if the addition of extra finger bones in the flipper and the locking of the elbow joint has forced both major groups of cetaceans down a similar evolutionary pathway in terms of locomotion. A second species from the Ankylorhiza genus is set to be described in a follow up paper as well as juvenile specimens of Ankylorhiza tiedemani comb. n., according to the statement. Boessenecker says other unique and strange early dolphins and baleen whales may yet emerge from the Oligocene aged rocks of Charleston, South Carolina, offering unparalleled evolutionary insight into a poorly understood era of whale evolution."}, {"title": "Giant Dinosaurs and Pterosaurs May Have Evolved From This Four-Inch-Tall Reptile", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "July 9, 2020", "doc": "Paleontologists have discovered a new species of reptile from the dawn of the dinosaurs that was so small it could stand in the palm of your hand, reports Will Dunham for Reuters. The researchers say the four inch tall, 237 million year old creature, named Kongonaphon kely, is an ancestor of both the famously giant dinosaurs and the flying pterosaurs, suggesting the largest animals ever to walk on land or take to the skies share miniature evolutionary origins. Theres a general perception of dinosaurs as being giants, says Christian Kammerer, curator of paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, in a statement. But this new animal is very close to the divergence of dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and its shockingly small. Kongonaphon kely was unearthed in Madagascar, and its name is a mixture of ancient Greek and Malagasy that means tiny bug slayer, reports Ashley Strickland for CNN. Researchers announced the find in a new paper published this week in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The extinct reptiles pointed teeth and diminutive stature inspired its name, Kammerer tells Nina Pullano of Inverse. The fossil includes an upper jaw lined with pointed peg like, unserrated teeth, Kammerer tells Inverse, which suggests an insectivorous diet for this tiny predator. The researchers think the bug slayer was likely bipedal and measured about 16 inches long from nose to tail. The fossil, originally found in 1998 in southwestern Madagascar, also included limb bones. John Flynn, a paleontologist with the American Museum of Natural History and co author of the research, tells CNN that examining a section of the thigh bone allowed the team to determine that they were dealing with the remains of an adult rather than a baby. Thats critically important for confidently concluding that the ancestors of dinosaurs and pterosaurs were tiny, in contrast to the later dinosaur giants that roamed the landscape or large pterosaurs flying high above them, Flynn tells CNN. Kongonaphons small size may be evidence of a miniaturization event among early ornithodirans, a group encompassing later dinosaurs and pterosaurs, the researchers write in the paper. It seems the origin of ornithodirans was associated with a size squeeze, Kammerer tells Inverse, which may have helped this group to flourish at a time when large bodied roles in terrestrial ecosystems were mostly being filled by crocodile relatives and protomammals. Early ornithodirans are rare in the fossil record, which has obscured the shared origin of dinosaurs and pterosaurs. Sites in Madagascar in particular have played a crucial role in illuminating the poorly understood Triassic period 251.9 to 201 million years ago, says Lovasoa Ranivoharimanana, study co author and paleontologist at the University of Antananarivo in Madagascar, in the statement. From the humble beginnings of creatures like Kongonaphon, dinosaurs and pterosaurs emerged around 230 million years ago, according to Reuters. Dinosaurs went on to reach lengths of more than 100 feet, and one pterosaur had a wingspan of more than 30 feet. In light of such huge descendants, an animal like Kongonaphon that could fit into your hands seems almost paradoxical, Kammerer tells Reuters. However, it fits the broader pattern that we observe at this time. There was a sustained trend towards smaller adult body sizes in the early history of this lineage. The newly described fossil and others from the early to mid Triassic may also help paleontologists figure out the evolutionary path pterosaurs took to ruling Earths ancient skies. Kammerer tells Inverse the earliest known pterosaurs were already fully capable of flight. He adds that there are no good intermediates between fully terrestrial reptiles and flying pterosaurs. Finding more early ornithodirans, Kammerer tells Inverse, could reveal the evolutionary steps that allowed the descendants of creatures like Kongonaphon to get airborne. In the future, Flynn tells CNN that the team hopes to investigate whether Kongonaphon was more closely related to pterosaurs or dinosaurs and to further explore what may have caused the miniaturization event that gave rise to the 4 inch tall predator."}, {"title": "300-Pound, Wombat-Like Creature Once Roamed Australia ", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "June 29, 2020", "doc": "Paleontologists announced the discovery of an extinct Australian mammal resembling a 300 pound wombat in new research published in the journal Scientific Reports. If youre struggling to picture a wombat, imagine a stocky, short limbed ball of burrowing marsupial fluff, as Joshua Sokol helpfully describes for the New York Times. Humans find wombats so adorable that Maria Island National Park in Tasmania had to issue a special advisory asking visitors to stop petting them, trying to take selfies with them and generally attempting to squeeze them for ever and ever. The next crucial step to imagining this 25 million year old animal is to take the trundling wombat youve conjured and make it the size of a black bear, which is the living animal that study co author Mike Archer, a paleontologist at the University of New South Wales, used to approximate the new species size in a statement. The big boned creature was named Mukupirna nambensis for the words muku bones and pirna big of the indigenous Dieri and Malyangapa languages spoken near where the fossil was unearthed. The find included a partial skull and skeleton that revealed Mukupirna would have been an herbivore well suited to digging like wombats, though judging by its size it was probably not a full blown burrower. Mukupirna clearly was an impressive, powerful beast, at least three times larger than modern wombats, says lead study author Robin Beck, a paleontologist at the University of Salford, in the statement. It probably lived in an open forest environment without grasses, and developed teeth that would have allowed it to feed on sedges, roots, and tubers that it could have dug up with its powerful front legs. While wombats are its closest living relatives, Mukupirna has such unfamiliar features that researchers placed it in its very own, newly created family of marsupials, according to the statement. The form of the teeth is unlike any that weve ever seen in any other group of marsupials, Archer tells Anna Salleh of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Compared to wombats, Archer tells ABC that Mukupirna had dainty chompers with thin enamel that suggest its diet consisted of softer, more nutritious foliage than the tough grasses favored by wombats today. The Mukupirna fossil was first collected in 1973 at Australias Lake Pinpa, a remote, dried up salt lake to the east of the Flinders Ranges in South Australia, according to the statement. When researchers started working on it again about ten years ago, they realized it could be something of a missing link within the vombatiformsan evolutionary group that includes wombats and koalas. Gavin Prideaux, a palaeontologist from Flinders University who was not involved in the research, tells ABC that while its been understood for some time that wombats and koalas are each others closest living relatives, the substantial differences between them also suggest their evolutionary paths diverged long ago. Speaking with ABC, Prideaux says Mukupirna could help fill in the evolutionary gap between the two marsupials. Its got attributes that shows its very clearly not a wombat, but its halfway to being a wombat, he says. Within the extinct vombatiforms, Mukupirnas big boned heft wasnt even particularly unusual. Amy Woodyatt and Rob Picheta of CNN report that the researchers found that members of the group evolved body weights of 220 pounds or more no fewer than six times in the past 25 million years. The very largest one, according to the statement, was a vombatiform named Diprotodon, thundered across the outback weighing more than two metric tons until at least 50,000 years ago."}, {"title": "First Soft-Shelled Dinosaur Egg Fossils Found", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "June 22, 2020", "doc": "Two studies published this week in the journal Nature are upending paleontologists understanding of ancient reptile reproduction, reports Lucas Joel for the New York Times. One study found evidence that some of the earliest dinosaurs laid soft shelled eggs, and not eggs with hard shells as was previously thought. The second discovery is another soft shelled egg that researchers have attributed to a kind of giant marine reptile called a mosasaur. The giant, nearly foot long egg suggests mosasaurs didnt give live birth as researchers once assumed, but instead laid leathery shelled eggs like their closest living relatives monitor lizards and snakes. The new evidence that some dinosaurs and their extinct reptilian contemporaries laid eggs without hard shells helps explain the rarity of eggs in the first half of the fossil record, according to the Times. Soft shells tend to rot away quickly, which would have made it less likely for them to fossilize. Both finds may have implications for the reproductive evolution of dinosaurs and ancient reptiles. Chilean paleontologists found The Thing in Antarctica in 2011. It was a fossil the size of a football that had a crinkled exterior that made it look deflated. The researchers who had collected The Thing couldnt tell what it was, reports Nell Greenfieldboyce of NPR. But when paleontologist Julia Clarke of the University of Texas at Austin saw its rumpled surface, she knew just what she was looking at. It was a giant, soft shelled egg, and it was also 66 million years old, the researchers report this week in Nature. No fossilized embryo or hatchling was available to positively identify what creature produced it. The researchers arrived at their suggestion that it came from a mosasaur based on the fossil eggs size, shape and the fact that mosasaur remains were found nearby. The team estimates the mosasaur that laid the egg was more than 20 feet long, without including its tail, according to a statement from the University of Texas at Austin UTA. The find represents the first fossil egg ever found in Antarctica, the largest known soft shelled egg and the second largest egg ever known to have existed, according to the UTA statement. The massive size of the egg also challenges assumptions about how big eggs with soft shells can get before collapsing, Lucas Legendre, a paleontologist at UTA and the studys lead author, tells the Times. Paleontologists dont know for sure the egg came from a mosasaur. And in light of the other newly published paper documenting soft shelled eggs in dinosaurs for the first time, the intriguing possibility exists that the giant ovum was produced by a dinosaur and somehow washed out to sea. The first dinosaur eggs were found in the 1800s. Paleontologists went on to find communal nests and evidence of brooding that made dinosaur parents seem much like the creatures that are some of their closest living relatives modern birds, write archaeologists Johan Lindreg of Lund University and Benjamin Kear of Uppsala University in a commentary published along with the new research. As our understanding of dinosaur eggs deepened, so did certain inconsistencies. Most of the dino eggs paleontologists uncovered were from the Cretaceouswhich lasted from 66 million to 145 million years agoleaving a more than 100 million year gap in the fossil record during the Triassic and Jurassic periods, according to the commentary. The bulk of the eggs also came from a suspiciously small number of dinosaur groups. Over the last 20 years, weve found dinosaur eggs around the world. But for the most part, they only represent three groupstheropod dinosaurs, which includes modern birds, advanced hadrosaurs like the duck bill dinosaurs, and advanced sauropods, the long necked dinosaurs, says Mark Norell, paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History and lead author of the study, in the statement from the museum. At the same time, weve found thousands of skeletal remains of ceratopsian dinosaurs, but almost none of their eggs. So why werent their eggs preserved? My guessand what we ended up proving through this studyis that they were soft shelled. The research that confirmed Norells hunch describes eggs from two different species of plant eating dinosaurs, per NPR. The twin finds come from Protoceratops, a sheep sized relative of the more famous Triceratops that lived between 71 million and 145 million years ago, and Mussaurus, a long necked dinosaur about 20 feet long that lived between 208.5 million and 227 million years ago, per the museums statement. The Protoceratops fossil was a clutch of embryos found in Mongolia in the 90s, reports Michael Greshko of National Geographic. The embryos were all early enough in their development that the absence of hard egg shells from the fossil was conspicuous. Similarly, expeditions in 2012 and 2013 to Argentina unearthed a group of Mussaurus embryos that had no sign of calcified eggshells nearby, according to National Geographic. The recognition that the fossils contained the remnants of soft shelled eggs came from chemical analysis prompted by strange haloes surrounding the embryos, according to the Times. Molecular paleobiologist Jasmina Wiemann of Yale University compared the chemical composition of these haloes surrounding the fossil embryos to that of modern hard and soft shelled eggs and found the chemical fingerprint of the fossils matched the eggs with soft shells, she tells the Times. Finding out that some dinosaur groups laid soft shelled eggs also explains puzzling differences that paleontologists have noted in the surfaces of previously discovered hard shelled eggs, write Lindreg Kear in their commentary. Instead, Norell and his colleagues suggest that hard shelled eggs evolved at least three times in separate lineages. The dinosaur calcified egg is something that is not ancestral, that is not sort of a primitive feature of all dinosaurs, Wiemann tells NPR. The soft shell revelation also suggests that many dinosaurs buried their eggs like some modern reptiles, since soft shells lose moisture quickly and couldnt withstand the weight of a brooding parent. The idea that the ancestral dinosaur laid soft shelled eggs like a turtle is a bold hypothesis, but I like it, Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study, tells the Times. Its a stunning revelationand its remarkable to think of these giant dinosaurs, larger than buses and in some cases airplanes, starting out as little pipsqueaks tearing their way out of a soft egg."}, {"title": "Fossil Footprints Suggest Ancient Crocodile Walked on Two Legs", "author": "Theresa Machemer", "date": "June 16, 2020", "doc": "A prehistoric ancestor of the crocodile may have walked on two legs, according to a paper published on June 11 in Scientific Reports. The new research focuses on large footprints in the Jinju rock formation in South Korea. A 2012 investigation of large, poorly defined footprints suggested that they might have come from a flying reptile called a pterosaur, but clearer footprints discovered recently changed the story. The new footprints capture the shape of the ancient creatures toes and the texture of its skin, both of which are classically crocodilian. But the footprints had another curious feature there were only prints from back feet. To paleontologist Martin Lockley, who specializes in trace fossils at the University of Colorado Denver, the lack of front footprints probably means that the ancient crocodile walked only on its back legs. We have dozens of these things, and not one sign of a front footprint, so were pretty convinced, Lockley tells Science News. The tracks are between seven and ten inches long and the animal that left them was probably similar in size to modern crocodiles. It lived during the early Cretaceous period, about 106 million years ago. The late Cretaceous saw the lifetimes of several dinosaur celebrities like Tyrannosaurus rex, Triceratops and Iguanadon. The muddy, lake covered coastal area where the ancient crocodylomorphs lived was a prime location to preserve footprints, Tim Vernimmen writes for National Geographic, and thousands of tracks can be found there today. When Martin Lockley visited the site in November 2019, I asked him what he thought of these tracks, Kyung Soo Kim of Chinju National University of Education in Jinju tells National Geographic. He immediately suggested that they were of the type known as Batrachopus, a crocodylian. I didnt believe it at that time, because I couldnt imagine a bipedal crocodile. But later, I was convinced by the blunt toes, the toe pads, and the details of the skin. The find came as a surprise. Paleontologists have found evidence of bipedal crocodiles before in North Carolina, but that animal lived about 231 million years ago, per Science News. That places it during the Triassic period, or at least 70 million years before the Cretaceous. No one knew that large bipedal crocs existed in the early Cretaceous, Lockley tells New Scientists Layal Liverpool. The new footprints suggest that the previously discovered tracks belong to an ancient crocodile, too. But based on the tracks it left behind, the creature was unlike modern crocodiles in more ways than one. For one thing, the tracks it left behind show that the animal put its feet one in front of the other as it walked, instead of keeping each foot in its own lane like modern crocs, National Geographic reports. And the fossilized footprints show no sign of webbing between the toes, which modern crocs have, per New Scientist. Stony Brook University paleontologist Pedro Godoy tells New Scientist that while he agrees that the tracks dont belong to a pterosaur, the unusually large size of the tracks makes him think that more evidence is necessary to link them to an ancient crocodile. But to Emory University paleontologist Anthony Martin, the evidence is convincing. The imprints really do look like they were made by big crocodilians, Martin, who was not involved in the new study, tells National Geographic. Indeed, by ones that were walking on their rear feet and on land. Thats pretty weird. But then again, the Cretaceous was a weird and wondrous time."}, {"title": "Prehistoric Great White Shark Nursery Discovered in Chile ", "author": "Nora McGreevy", "date": "June 4, 2020", "doc": "Great white sharks have earned fame and captured the popular imagination with their impressive size, hunting savvy and fearsome serrated teeth. However, human pollution, poaching and fishing, combined with the sharks naturally low birth rates and long lifespans have made the fish vulnerable to extinctionand difficult for scientists to study. One new discovery sheds light on the history of this elusive fish. A team of scientists recently found evidence of a prehistoric great white shark nursery in the Coquimbo region of northern Chile, according to a paper published this month in Scientific Reports. These sharks likely lived between 2.5 to 5 million years ago, during the Pliocene Epoch, according to a statement. Led by Jaime A. Villafa\u00f1a at the University of Vienna, the team was studying great white shark teeth from three locations in South America when they realized that most of the teeth from the Coquimbo site were from juveniles, Hannah Osbourne reports for Newsweek. We were quite surprised to find such high numbers of juvenile white shark teeth in the area, J\u00fcrgen Kriwet, study co author, told Newsweek in an email. As Jake Rossen reports for Mental Floss, great whites protect their young, known as pups, in nurseries, usually in shallow seas or protected bays. Adult sharks guard their young from predators in these designated places until the pups can survive on their own. Great whites, or Carcharodon carcharias, reach sexual maturity in their twenties or thirties and can grow to be more than 60 years old. Researchers were able to estimate the body sizes and ages of these prehistoric sharks based on the size of their teeth, Ben Coxworth reports for New Atlas. The high concentration of juvenile shark teeth discovered in one area suggests that great white sharks have used nurseries to raise their young for millions of years, according to the study. As Douglas McCauley, an ecologist at the University of California Santa Barbara who was not involved in the study, tells Newsweek, the discovery of an ancient nursery isnt the researchers only exciting find. One thing that is interesting is that this study suggests white sharks may have been a lot more common in the past off the Pacific coast of South America than they are today, he says. The fossil record sheds they report on appear to paint a picture of Peru and Chile a million years ago that hosted thriving nurseries full of baby white sharks and buffet zones teeming with adults. But today white sharks are fairly rare in that region. Scientists today know of only a few active great white shark nurseries. The research group Ocearch discovered one nursery off the coast of New York in 2016the first of its kind found in the North Atlantic, as Jason Daley reported for Smithsonian magazine at the time. Researchers say that further study of this prehistoric nursery could aid current conservation efforts by helping scientists understand how nurseries aid great white shark survival. If we understand the past, it will enable us to take appropriate protective measures today to ensure the survival of this top predator, which is of utmost importance for ecosystems, Kriwet says in the statement."}, {"title": "Exquisitely Preserved \u2018Mona Lisa\u2019 of Dinosaur Fossils Reveals Prehistoric Creature\u2019s Last Meal", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "June 4, 2020", "doc": "In 2011, a worker operating heavy equipment at the Millennium oil sands mine in northern Alberta, Canada, uncovered the remains of an armored dinosaur so well preserved it looks less like a fossil and more like a living animal that somehow had the misfortune of being instantly turned to stone. The extraordinary fossil has already provided scientists with a fresh understanding of how the interlocking spiked plates covering the animals tough hide functioned and fit together, reports Michael Greshko of National Geographic. But now the dinosaurs life like remains are delivering even more intimate details about the 110 million year old herbivore new research teases apart the fossilized contents of the dinosaurs gut, revealing which plants it ate and even the season of its death, according to National Geographic. The armored dinosaur in question is Borealopelta markmitchelli, a burly, low to the ground type of plant eater called a nodosaur that lived in the Early Cretaceous. The nodosaur likely weighed around 3,000 pounds and was almost 20 feet long, per Greshkos coverage for National Geographic in 2017 when the fossil first went on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology in Canada. After munching on what turned out to be its final meal, Borealopelta died, probably in a riverbed, and was washed out to sea where it sank straight to the bottom, landing on its back, according to a statement from the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology. The fine sediments of the seafloor mummified the dinosaur, eventually freezing its body in stone with such fidelity researchers say it looks like its merely sleeping. It took fossil preparator Mark Mitchell, whose contribution is recognized in the latter half of the dinos scientific name, more than 7,000 hours to chip and scratch away until Borealopeltas shape emerged. The new analysis focused on a soccer ball sized mass found in the fossils abdominal cavity that paleontologists identified as being the contents of the creatures digestive tract. To pick apart the contents of this ball of partially digested fossilized plants, called a cololite, researchers sliced sheets of the specimen for examination under a microscope, reports George Dvorsky of Gizmodo. The detail contained in these slices of ancient life astounded the authors of the study, published this week in the journal Royal Society Open Science. The leaf fragments and other plant fossils were preserved down to the cells, David Greenwood, a biologist at Brandon University and study coauthor, tells Ashley Strickland of CNN. We could see the different layers of cells in a leaf fragment including the epidermis with the pores, called stomata, through which plants take in carbon dioxide, Greenwood adds. We could also see the surface patterning of the epidermis cells, which was like a jigsaw pattern that we see on many living ferns. The researchers identified a group of gizzard stones, which the extinct animals swallowed to help pulverize their food similar to some modern birds, as well as a total of 48 microfossils of chewed up leaves, stems and twigs, according to the paper. The team then compared the assortment to other fossil plants known to have existed in the region around the same time, per Gizmodo. The cololite was mostly made up of ferns as well as mosses, conifers and a couple of flowering plants, the researchers write. But the paleontologists also noted the absence of certain plants. The lack of horsetails, and rarity of cycads and conifers is surprising, given that these are very common in the surrounding flora, Caleb Marshall Brown, the curator of dinosaur systematics and evolution at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology and study co author, tells CNN. Even within ferns, it looks like Borealopelta may have had a preference for certain types of ferns, while ignoring others. Using some paleontological sleuthing, the researchers also worked out the time of year the dinosaur died. Incomplete growth rings on the woody twigs found in the dinosaurs gut signaled that the plants were about halfway through their growing seasonwhich would have lasted from late spring to the dog days of summerwhen they got chomped, according to National Geographic. The fern fronds also featured mature structures called sporangia which the plants use to disperse their spores. This herbaceous evidence slotted Borealopeltas death sometime in early to mid summer and suggested it died shortly after its last mouthful of greenery, per a statement from the University of Saskatchewan. But the dinos last meal had one more surprise for researchers charcoal. Roughly six percent of the cololite was burnt up plant matter, suggesting to the researchers that Borealopelta was foraging among the new growth of a forest that had recently gone up in flames. This adaptation to a fire ecology is new information, says Greenwood in the statement. Like large herbivores alive today such as moose and deer, and elephants in Africa, these nodosaurs by their feeding would have shaped the vegetation on the landscape, possibly maintaining more open areas by their grazing.\u202f It is fitting that such a life like fossil should offer such a detailed glimpse into its ancient environment. We get used to seeing dinosaurs as dead things, not as living things, James Basinger, a paleobotanist at the University of Saskatchewan and co author of the research, tells National Geographic. This is a really important way to remind people that were actually dealing with things that wandered around the landscape and ate stuff ... not just bones in a museum. Further study of the unique specimen could help researchers understand how such a large animal survived on food with relatively low nutrient content, Brown tells CNN. The team also plans to search for traces of the dinosaurs other internal organs, per Gizmodo, and to use their new knowledge of its diet to get a clearer picture of its habitat in the Early Cretaceous."}, {"title": "Carnivorous Dinosaurs Like Allosaurus Were Cannibals", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "May 27, 2020", "doc": "Not far from the Colorado Utah border, the Mygatt Moore Quarry bonebed is brimming with hundreds of fossils from Jurassic favorites like Apatosaurus and Allosaurus. Similar dinos have been found at spots around the American West, but the carnivores found here must have been hungry. Dozens of bones bear the toothmarks of massive meat eatersincluding the bones of carnivores themselves, suggesting at least a little dinosaur cannibalism. The site probably smelled terrible Bitten bones and broken teeth are rare finds at dinosaurs digs. Thats because rapid burial is usually required for fossil preservation, and if that happens, then scavengers dont get much chance to pick at the free meat. However, in a survey of more than 2,000 bones from Mygatt Moore published today in the journal PLOS ONE, University of Tennessee Knoxville paleontologist Stephanie Drumheller Horton and colleagues found that 28 percent of the fossils were punctured, bitten and scratched by carnivores, a far greater percentage than other sites in the Morrison Formation, a huge span of rock in the American West that contains the Mygatt Moore.\n\nWhile tooth traces in bone are not uncommon in the Morrison, the sheer number of chewed bones at Mygatt Moore is surprising, says University of Wisconsin Oshkosh paleontologist Joseph Peterson, who was not involved in the study. The dinosaurs here acted differently, and the environment might offer a clue as to why. During the part of the Jurassic encapsulated by the Morrison Formation 146 to 156 million years ago the area now preserved as the Mygatt Moore quarry would have changed dramatically with the annual wet and dry seasons. In rainy months, the spot was probably a watering hole. The fact that fish, amphibians, crocodiles and other aquatic species are rare in the deposit suggests the water evaporated in the dry season. This setting may have given carnivores more of a chance to pick at carcasses before the returning rainstorms of the wet season washed enough sediment over the bones to bury them and preserve them as fossils. Drumheller Horton says other details on the fossil bones, such as signs of trampling, indicate they were exposed for a stretch before burial. We think that carcasses would have persisted on the landscape for a pretty long time, she says. Weve been joking that the site probably smelled terrible. The evidence also suggests the carnivores that left teeth marks at the site werent in a feeding frenzy but took each bite with intent. Predators will usually target the high economy anatomical regions first, like the viscera and the meatiest long bones, Drumheller Horton says, and then work down to the lowest economy bones, like toes. If paleontologists find bite marks on the parts without much good meat, then the carnivore was probably late to the party and the more desirable parts were already gone. At Mygatt Moore, Drumheller Horton says, the team found a smattering of bite marks all over, so some carnivores may have taken down the prey and gotten first pick while others were left to gnaw on the carcasses later. When Allosaurus eats Allosaurus Many of the bones with bite marks come from Apatosaurus, a long necked herbivore. But the team also found tooth marks on the bones of the carnivorous Allosaurus. The pattern of bite marks indicates that non theropods have them in nutritious areas of the skeleton, whereas theropods elements tend to be better in lower nutrition areas, says bone injury specialist Ewan Wolff, who was not involved in the study. In other words Whatever was biting the Allosaurus would seem to have gotten to them late, or at least focused on areas that didnt have much flesh on them. The question is Who bit them? The three horned carnivore Ceratosaurus could have made the marks, but Ceratosaurus is rare at Mygatt Moore. The only other carnivore that could have made them is Allosaurus itself, which is much more abundant at the site and would mean Allosaurus were eating some of their own. Why would Allosaurus eat other Allosaurus? Evidence of dinosaur cannibalism is rare in the fossil record. To date, only two other predatory dinosaursTyrannosaurus and Majungasaurushave been shown to feed on the carcasses of their own species. Drumheller Horton notes that cannibalism isnt all that rare among modern carnivores, though. Almost no predator will turn down a free meal, so the line between predators and scavengers is fuzzy at best, she notes. The bite marks at the Mygatt Moore quarry might represent dinosaurs under stress, such as droughts and fires. The unusually high frequencies of bites we found might be evidence of carnivores trying to scrounge up every available resource to survive rougher parts of the year, Drumheller Horton says. Similar trends have been found at places like the La Brea asphalt seeps in Los Angeles, where stressful ecological times match up with a greater number of carnivores gnawing on bones.  Ancient bites, new insights Scientists once thought dinosaurs like Allosaurus rarely ate bones because their bite marks are uncommon at other quarries. The Mygatt Moore findings rewrite that story. It is easy to look at a predatory dinosaur like Allosaurus and make a lot of assumptions about how they lived, Peterson says. Paleontologists have been studying Late Jurassic bonebeds and the dinosaurs within since the 1800s, Peterson notes, yet studies like this new one highlight just how little we know about these familiar environments. These findings also might revise how researchers approach other dinosaur sites. In the past, Drumheller Horton notes, expeditions often focused on well preserved bones suitable for display or anatomical study. Bones that were damaged or not as aesthetically pleasing were often left behind or even destroyed. The new insights from Mygatt Moore partly came from a bulk collecting effort, including damaged and beaten bones in the sample.  Besides, the toothmarks may reveal the presence of carnivores that have yet to be seen in the bonebed. Striations on one particular bone, created by the serrations of a carnivores tooth, are too big to have been created by an average Allosaurus. The biter was either an exceptionally large Allosaurus, a much rarer Jurassic predator called Torvosaurus, or a dinosaur not yet seen. One predators bite has left paleontologists with a new mystery to solve."}, {"title": "Rare \u2018Light-Footed\u2019 Dinosaur Discovered in Australia for the First Time", "author": "Alex Fox", "date": "May 20, 2020", "doc": "A previously mysterious fossil found in Victoria, Australia, has been identified as a rare, beaked dinosaur called an elaphrosaur, according to new research.

As dinosaurs go, they were rather bizarre. The few known skulls of elaphrosaurs show that the youngsters had teeth, but that the adults lost their teeth and replaced them with a horny beak. We dont know if this is true for the Victorian elaphrosaur yetbut we might find out if we ever discover a skull, Poropat adds. Their toothsome youth suggests they may have gone through some kind of dietary shift with age, Poropat tells John Pickrell of the Guardian. But as their lack of fearsome chompers in adulthood suggests, elaphrosaurs were probably omnivores despite being theropods, which are cousins to Tyrannosaurus rex and other famous bygone carnivores, Steve Bursatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the research, tells the Guardian. This particular elaphrosaur was probably just shy of seven feet long from nose to tail, according to the statement. Elaphrosaurs are really rare, Poropat tells the Guardian. The elaphrosuars are a sparse lineage with just three named species that have been discovered in Tanzania, China and Argentina. This is the first record of the group in Australia, and only the second Cretaceous record worldwide, Poropat says. Bursatte says the discovery of this specimen in Australia greatly expands the range of these animals... They were probably a widespread, and perhaps even global, group of dinosaurs, which we havent yet appreciated because of the scanty clues they left behind. The fossil at the center of the new research, published earlier this month in the journal Gondwana Research, was first unearthed by dig volunteer Jessica Parker in 2015, per the statement. Parker spotted a strange, delicate bone roughly two inches long at a Cretaceous fossil bed known as Eric the Red West, near Cape Otway in Victoria. Researchers initially pegged the fossil as a vertebra belonging to a pterosaur, a type of flying reptile, but closer examination revealed its surprising identity. The slender, swift footed elaphrosaur is also unique among its brethren for when it lived. Its relatives Elaphrosaurus from Tanzania and Limusaurus from Chin date from the late Jurassic 160 145 million years ago, but the Australian elaphrosaur lived around 40 million years later during the Early Cretaceous. At that time, around 110 million years ago, Australia was located inside the Antarctic Circle and the fossil bed at Eric the Red West was home to a swiftly flowing river bordered by lush plant life, Poropat tells ABC News. There were conifer trees, things like modern day monkey puzzles. There were ferns and lots of flowering plants, he continues. The ancient riverbed has also preserved a jumble of bones from meat eating dinosaurs, plant eating dinosaurs, turtles and fish alongside the elaphrosaur, suggesting it was part of a diverse ecosystem. The researchers are anxious to return to the Eric the Red West fossil bed soon, according to the statement, but their plans are on hold due to COVID 19 and had already been delayed once due to fire season. Poropat praised the contribution of Parker, the volunteer who found the fossil. As this story tells, one bone can change our understanding completely, he tells ABC News. If it belongs to a group of animals that we didnt know was represented in Victoria, let alone Australia before, it can shape our understanding of the fauna."}, {"title": "Groundbreaking Fossil Suggests Spinosaurus Is First Known Swimming Dinosaur", "author": "Katherine J. Wu", "date": "April 30, 2020", "doc": "When Munichs Paleontological Museum was bombed in 1944, the institutions collections were destroyed. Included in the wreckage was the only known partial skeleton of Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, a peculiar dinosaur that would later ignite an intense debate among paleontologists. The fossilized bits, first discovered in Egypt in the early 1910s, seemed to challenge the idea that all dinosaurs were strictly land dwellers. Sporting a mix of odd features, including a skull that hinted at a fish based diet, Spinosaurus may have spent some of its time swimming in open water. In the decades since, a smattering of other Spinosaurus remainsall sparse and incompletehave been found, fueling debate on both sides. Dinosaurs are considered, after all, to be complete landlubbers. Most Mesozoic Era ocean dwelling creatures were actually marine reptiles called plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, or mosasaurs, which, despite their appearance, are not considered dinosaurs. Claims of an exception demanded extraordinary evidence.  Now, a striking find from Morocco may finally be putting the matter to bed. Reporting this week in the journal Nature, a team of researchers has uncovered a 95 million year old Spinosaurus tail with an unusual paddle shape. Structured like a thick, bony oar that could have rocked from side to side, the two foot long appendage is unmistakably aquatic, researchers argue, and likely propelled the gargantuan dinosaur through the water depths of rivers, where it snared and snacked on fish. This was basically a dinosaur trying to build a fish tail, study author Nizar Ibrahim, a vertebrate paleontologist at University of Detroit Mercy, tells Michael Greshko at National Geographic. The discovery bucks years of speculation that Spinosaurus simply dabbled in watery activities, wading into the shallows to hunt before quickly retreating back ashore. It also represents one of the most unusual traits ever attributed to a large, predatory dinosaur, Matthew Lamanna, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, who reviewed the paper for Nature, tells Carolyn Gramling at Science News. \n\nThe tail was just so awesomely weird looking, Lamanna tells Science News. Id never seen anything like it. For Ibrahim and his team, the finding was less of a surprise. Several years ago, they analyzed a set of Spinosaurus bones, found in Morocco in 2008, that seemed to have unusually thick walls, a feature that helps animals like penguins and manatees control how buoyant they are in water. The researchers arguedcontroversiallythat the dinosaur might have been more dexterous in the water than its distant, land dwelling relatives like Tyrannosaurus rex. Though some, like Lindsay Zanno, a paleontologist at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, praised the findings at the time, others pushed back, according to National Geographic. So Ibrahim and his colleagues returned to the site of the 2008 fossil. In 2018, they struck gold, unearthing a tail that was nearly 80 percent complete, Ibrahim tells Science News. Bristling with long spines that branched out into a fin shape, the tail was wide, strong and flexible, modeling studies suggested. Unlike the long, narrowing tails of land living dinosaurs, Spinosaurus rearmost appendage seemed built to whip back and forth like that of a crocodile or a newta theory that seemed borne out when the researchers modeled its motion in a water tank. If Spinosaurus truly was the sort of swimmer its tail suggests it was, paleontologists may need to rework their definitions of dinosaursa group whose members must lay their eggs on land, and have traditionally been thought of as terrestrial, Ryan F. Mandelbaum reports for Gizmodo. But boundaries have been broken on the tree of life before, points out Thomas Holtz, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park who was not involved in the study, in an interview with Science News We think of mammals as a terrestrial group, but we have whales and bats. Speaking with Gizmodo, Steven Brusatte, a paleontologist from the University of Edinburgh who wasnt involved in the study, notes that Spinosaurus fishy tail wouldnt have precluded it from making a living on land, tooat least some of the time. Its fossils are also found inland, he says, so it probably was comfortable on land and in water. And when it did venture out for a swim, Spinosaurus probably stuck to the shallows, keeping within a safe distance of the shore, Brusatte notes. But in dipping its toesand its tailin the water at all, this versatile dinosaur may still have made quite the evolutionary splash."}, {"title": "After the Dinosaur-Killing Impact, Soot Played a Remarkable Role in Extinction", "author": "Nola Taylor Redd", "date": "April 27, 2020", "doc": "The interstellar object alternatively a comet or an asteroid that killed the dinosaurs when it slammed into Earth didnt work alone. Researchers have shown previously that its after effects, such as tidal waves and earthquakes, played an important role in the mass extinctions of three fourths of plant and animal life. Now, new research suggests that one of the most important factors was the soot rich smoke from fires sparked by the collision. Clay Tabor, a geoscientist at the University of Connecticut, and his colleagues studied soot, sulfates and dust to see how each type of particle may have contributed to the cataclysm. They found that while all three particles blocked heat from the sun, soot played a dominant role. The results were published earlier this year in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. When the impactor plowed into the Earth and created the Chicxulub crater in Mexico, it vaporized the crust and created a planet wide plume of debris that emitted radiation at a rate about 20 times stronger than the sun. It ignited plants and animals in its path. Later, lightning from impact generated storms ignited more fires, maintaining an atmosphere rich in soot. Soot is very good at absorbing sunlight, Tabor says. As soot gets into the stratosphere, some of it heats the atmosphere and self lofts higher, increasing its atmospheric residence time. The soot was the death knell for many marine creatures. While oceans protected them from blazes, the soot remained in the atmosphere to block most sunlight for nearly two years, darkening the skies and preventing photosynthesis. The new calculations suggest that it took almost six years for sunlight levels at the surface to return to normal, hindering recovery and leading to mass marine extinctions. Soot blocked sunlight, greatly reducing if not shutting down photosynthesis on both the land and in the sea, says Chicxulub expert David Kring of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Texas. Without photosynthesis, the base of the food chain would have collapsed. While fires may have demolished vegetation on land in large areas of the world, globally distributed soot may have ravaged vegetation elsewhere. A dark death The colossal chunk of rock that carved out a circular fault in the Gulf of Mexico 66 million years ago exploded with the equivalent of 100 trillion tons of TNT. The years that followed would have been like the apocalyptic nuclear winter that scientists say would follow a nuclear war, complete with raging fires and black out skies. A challenge has been figuring out just how widespread fires were. Scientists have discovered microscopic particles of soot matching forest fire smoke in the ground, revealing that nearly 70 billion tons of ash from the Cretaceous world is embedded in Earths crust. But wind could easily blow soot across the landscape, potentially depositing it far from its source, making it difficult to pin down the locations of fires. Tabor and his colleagues hoped to sort out the soot by modeling its impact separate from that of sulfates and dust. The new study started by modeling the topography, vegetation and greenhouse gases of the Cretaceous Period. The team also simulated the thermosphere and allowed the sizes of impact aerosols to change over time. Previous models had struggled to quantify these effects. The impact and fire generated pollutants were so voluminous that they caused previous computer models to crash, Kring says. The current study seems to have succeeded where past attempts failed. Eventually, the soot settled out of the atmosphere. The largest particles fell out in only a few months, but the fine particles left behind did plenty of damage. For nearly two years, the Earth received about one percent of pre impact sunlight, with midlatitudes suffering the longest. Over the next four years, the dust slowly washed away with the rain. Sulfates also played an important role. The longest lasting particles reduced the light to about 77 percent of normal, blocking light for nearly six years. Dust had the most damaging effect, blocking all sunlight, but most of it fell out of the atmosphere in a handful of months. Tabor and his colleagues simulated each particle individually because they wanted to understand how each one alone affected the environment. However, Joanna Morgan, professor of geophysics at Imperial College London, argues that it would be better to include all these factors together because they interact. For example, soot and dust could coagulate, removing the soot more quickly than in the models, says Morgan, who wasnt involved in this study but whose own work challenges assumptions about how ejecta traveled from the crater to its final destination. The team is updating its model to include all three particles interacting at once but remains confident that a combined version will not change their current results. Still, Morgan isnt quite convinced that the new finding proves that soot is the most effective of the climate factors in this case. That seems to be quite a bold statement, she says. I am not sure that we can be that confident about how life reacted 66 million years ago in such extreme cold and dark conditions. Chills and rain While sooty darkness played a significant role in killing off life after the impact, it also had other environmental effects. Soot, sulfates and dust also would have stopped the suns heat from reaching the surface. Global temperatures at the time of impact were relatively warm, which could have left life particularly vulnerable to a deep freeze from the impact winter, the authors wrote. In terms of rapid cooling, soot was once again the worst culprit, dropping temperatures over the land by nearly 30 degrees Celsius and over the oceans by 13 degrees in just three years. Because the particles lingered in the atmosphere, temperatures in some areas did not return to their pre impact levels for more than a decade. Sulfates contributed to the temperature drop to a lesser degree, but their effects were more long lasting, hanging around for a dozen years. Dust had the smallest effect. The loss of sunlight also affected rainfall, as typical large scale atmospheric circulation patterns would have broken down. The subsequent loss of precipitation could have had an impact on Cretaceous wildlife and meant that there was less rain to put out wildfires. However, the changes in circulation patterns meant that some areas likely received more rain than they had in the past. Once again, soot produced the biggest change, dampening rainfall by over half in the short term. Sulfates quickly followed. Dust significantly blocked global rainfall, but its quick exit from the atmosphere had a lesser effect. Although these drivers likely contributed to the extinction of much of Earths flora and fauna, soot inspired darkness most likely led the way. In the long cold days that followed the impact, the lack of light likely played the most important role in the loss of life."}, {"title": "Neanderthals Really Liked Seafood", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "March 30, 2020", "doc": "In the 1980s, a Neanderthal cave dwelling was identified on the coast of Portugal, some 20 miles south of Lisbon. Ten years ago, a team of experts revisited the cave, and in one of its tiny nooks, they found a rich cache of remains from aquatic animals like fish, mussels, crustaceans, sharks, dolphins and sealssigns of a seafood smorgasbord. The discovery, described in a new report in Science, was a remarkable one. Scientists had previously unearthed hints that Neanderthals exploited marine resources the extinct hominids fashioned tools out of clam shells and used shells to make jewelry beads. But there had been no evidence that Neanderthals were hunting aquatic animals in a significant way. In fact, some experts had posited that the consumption of seafood helped give Homo sapiens an edge over Neanderthals fish and other marine creatures are rich in omega 3 fatty acids, which promote the development of brain tissue. Enhanced cognitive development bolstered by seafood could, in theory, explain why early humans were capable of abstract thought and communicationas evidenced by their apparent use of body paint and ornaments, for instanceand why they formed organized, complex societies. But if marine foods were important to modern humans, then they were important for Neanderthals as wellor perhaps they did not have the importance people have been attributing to them, study co author Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o of the University of Barcelona, tells the Guardians Nicola Davis. The aquatic remains date between 86,000 and 106,000 years ago and were discovered in a small, cramped room of cave of Figueira Brava. I was in the fetal position every single day, Filipa Rodrigues, an archaeologist at the University of Lisbon who worked on the excavation, says in an interview with Nicholas St. Fleur of the New York Times. Today, the cave is located right along the coast, but in the days of the Neanderthals, it would have been about a mile away. They seem to have been transporting large quantities of food from the sea. In some areas of the cave, the density of shells was more than 800 pounds per cubic meter, suggesting that they used baskets or bags as part of their fishing process. Some of the remainslike those belonging to seals, dolphins and waterfowlmay have been scavenged from the shore, but the smaller prey could have been easily plucked from low tides, the researchers say. Their hunting methods may not have been complicated, but the Neanderthals of Figueira Brava seem to have had an understanding of tidal patterns and, possibly, some of the risks associated with seafood consumption phytoplankton blooms during warmer months can cause shellfish to become toxic. Traces of horses, deer and pine nuts were also discovered in the cave, which in conjunction with the aquatic animal finds, reflect the exploitation of all ecosystems present in the sites catchment among mountain, estuary, and sea rocky shores, coastal lagoons, alluvial plains, dune pinewoods, and forested slopes, the study authors write. But if Neanderthals were capable of extensive marine hunting why, until now, has no evidence of their seafood diet surfaced? It is possible, according to the researchers, that the advance of polar ice caps over a long period of climate change destroyed most coastal deposits that testified to Neanderthals exploitation of marine resources. But Figueira Brava is located along a very steep shelf, they write, which has enabled extant and submerged shorelines to be preserved short distances apart. The new study provides further evidence that Neanderthals were far more sophisticated than their brutish reputation suggests. Research has shown that they buried their dead, cared for their sick, possibly painted caves. They interacted and mated with early humansand, according to Zilh\u00e3o, were likely not all that different from them. I feel ... uncomfortable with the comparison between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, because the bottom line is Neanderthals were Homo sapiens, too, he tells Davis. Not only was there extensive inter breeding  but also in every single aspect of cognition and behaviour for which we have archaeological evidence, Neanderthals pass the sapiens test with outstanding marks."}, {"title": "Why It\u2019s So Difficult to Find Earth\u2019s Earliest Life", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "March 30, 2020", "doc": "The search for signs of Earths earliest forms of life isnt quite like looking for dinosaur bones protruding out from desert outcrops. The oldest species on our planet were microscopic, nothing more than itty bitty specks. Detecting them, and verifying their identity, is a complicated task that often relies not only hunting town tiny remains but also on chemistry and perceiving how those microorganisms modified their environments. Every time I have ever told anyone I look for fossils, I then have to follow up that Im lot looking for fun things like bones or shells or claws or teeth, says University of Kansas geologist Alison Olcott. But charismatic creatures like dinosaurs are only a small part of our planets story. Even now, the majority of life on Earth is squishy and microscopic, she says. The trick is following that fossil trail to its source. Signals in the Sands of Time Picking out the evidence of Earths earliest life is more than a needle in a haystack problem. The entire planet is the metaphorical haystack, while the needles are no more than microscopic cells or faint chemical traces. Even when scientists can pin down possible candidates, its can be hard to know for sure when something is a signature of ancient life rather than a plain old geologic phenomenon. Consider the case of extremely old stromatolites, layered underwater mounds created by cyanobacteria. Bacteria have been building these mounds for billions of years and in some places, such as Utahs Great Salt Lake, they continue to do so.  In 2016, a team of researchers from Australia proposed that they had found evidence of stromatolites being formed about 3.7 billion years ago, which would make them a remnant of some of the earliest known organisms. The Earth itself, after all, is only about 4.5 billion years old.  But other experts werent convinced. The fossils preserved only the stromatolite structure, not the organisms that created them, and some researchers argued that the rocks were formed by other geological processes. However, a study published just last year put forth stronger evidence, including geochemical analysis, that suggests some 3.5 billion year old stromatolites found at a different site in Australia do record and contain evidence of some of Earths oldest microbes. The search for the signs of early life, what experts call biosignatures, often focuses on four different lines of evidence, says University of New South Wales astrobiologist Tara Djokic. The first kind of evidence is relatively large and can be seen with the naked eye, such as the stromatolites. Other traces are much harder to find, and that group includes chemical traces of fossils, degraded biological compounds, and fossils of microorganisms themselves.  Parsing these clues is no small task. It is very difficult to fossilize something with no mineralized parts, Olcott says. In addition, some non biological processes and phenomena can mimic the shape and chemical signatures of microbial life.  Finding any one of the four markers is a good hint. But, Djokic says, finding more than one of these together would of course strengthen the argument. Thats because its not always easy to tell whats a real sign of early life and whats a trick from deep time. Sometimes folds in rock or other non living features can look like stromatolites. What might look like a group of tiny cells could be some kind of sedimentary structure. Billions of years have passed since the time Earths first life originated. The rocks containing signs of early life, Djokic says, have been deformed, and metamorphosed by heat, stress, and hydrothermal alteration and then subject to billions of years of weathering processes such as erosion. And there arent many of them left exposed.  Thanks to billions of years of the rock cycle, there are not so many rocks which are even suitable to search in for signs of early life, Olcott says. Searching for early life requires understandingand correcting forthe factors that may obscure the truth. Its like coming to a crime scene and having to piece together what has happened and who was involved, Djokic says. The Race for the Oldest At present, the starting date for life on Earth is still rough. There is no specific site that is considered to be 100 percent proof of the earliest signs of life on Earth, Djokic says. One of the oldest, least controversial sites is the 3.4 billion year old Strelley Pool Formation in Australia, Olcott notes. Researchers have found stromatolites, microbial mats, chemical signatures indicative of life and more. Older sites hold potential but are controversial. A roughly 3.8 billion year old site in Greenland may contain even older traces of life, but this spot is more contentious, Djokic says, because the rocks there have been through the geological ringer and are more difficult to interpret. The search, and ensuing debate, continues. Different research groups have their favored candidates for the oldest signs of life on Earth, with an informal race to find the oldest. But, Olcott notes, I think a large part of the lack of consensus is the lack of an unambiguous sign of life.  What researchers propose as the earliest signs of life hinge upon what we know of living and non living phenomena on Earth, and how these can lead to similar results that can be challenging to tease apart. A field site could contain carbonaceous microstructures that look like fossils but also chemical signals that are not consistent with life, or vice versa, Olcott says, with additional threads of evidence needed to determine whether signs of life are present. Researchers from a diversity of backgrounds keep going back to the slivers of Earths ancient rocks to keep searching. The hunt isnt just for the fossils themselves, Djokic points out, but humanitys origins. Determining the timing and nature of early life tells us about where we came from, and the details of life for most of Earths history. Such clues tell us what to look for as we search other planets for life.  These studies have given us an idea of how to search other planets, Olcott says, helping to refine what lines of evidence to look for and collect. Those plans are already underway, to be launched with the Mars 2020 Perseverance rover this year. Decades of fighting over evidence and interpretations on Earth, have hopefully prepared us to mount a search for potential signs of life elsewhere, Olcott says."}, {"title": "New Feathered Carnivorous Dinosaur Found in New Mexico", "author": "Brian Handwerk", "date": "March 26, 2020", "doc": "A new carnivorous feathered dinosaur, coyote sized with razor sharp teeth and claws, has been discovered in New Mexicos San Juan Basin. The small but formidable predator called Dineobellator would have stalked these open floodplains 70 million years ago. Steven Jasinski, a paleontologist at the State Museum of Pennsylvania and lead author of the study in Scientific Reports, says Dineobellator is a new species from the Late Cretaceous 70 68 million years ago that belongs to dromaeosaurid, a group of clawed predators closely related to birds. These rare fossils have features that suggest raptors were still trying out new ways to compete even during the dinosaurs last standthe era just before the extinction event that wiped them out 66 million years ago. This group was still evolving, testing out new evolutionary pathways, right at the very end before we lost them, Jasinski notes. The bones from this new specimen bear the scars of a combative lifestyle and suggest some unusual adaptations of tail and claw that might have helped Dineobellator notohesperus hunt and kill. The name Dineobellator pays homage to the dinos tenacity and that of the local Native American people. Din\u00e9 means the Navajo people, while bellator is the Latin word for warrior. Due to their small size and delicate bones, skeletons of raptors like Dineobellator are extremely rare in North America, particularly in the last 5 million years of the Age of Dinosaurs, says David Evans, a paleontologist at the Royal Ontario Museum and the University of Toronto, who wasnt involved in the study. Even though it is fragmentary, the skeleton of Dineobellator is one of the best specimens known from North America for its time, which makes it scientifically important and exciting. Over four field seasons between 2008 and 2016, Jasinski and colleagues unearthed 20 fossils from a single creatures skeleton, including parts of the skull, teeth, fore and hind legs, ribs and vertebrae. Dineobellators forearms feature quill knobs, bumps found on the bones of dinosaurs or birds that reveal where feathers once attached. Like its relative Velociraptor, this newfound animal was about the size of a coyote or large barnyard turkey, Jasinski says, but probably punched above its weight as a predator. The fossils indicate the dinosaur suffered a rib injury, but bone regrowth shows that it survived and healed. But this Dineobellator wasnt so fortunate with an injury to its hand claw. The hand claw injury doesnt show any bone regrowth, so it looks like it happened either right at death or just before, Jasinski says. Dineobellators unusual features include its forelimbs, which appear to be an uncommon shape that would have maximized muscle power to make them very strong, a trait Jasinski suggests was accentuated by claws on both hands and feet. Their grip would have been far stronger than what we see in the other members of this group, he says. Fossils from the animals tail also suggest an intriguing anatomy. Most similar dinosaurs have stiff tails reinforced with bones or tendons that would have helped with balance and aided running. What these animals have  is a lot of mobility at the base of the tail where it attaches to the hips, Jasinski says. If you think about how a cheetah attacks, their tail is whipping all over the place because they have to change directions very quickly so it increases agility. Thats what this animal would have been able to do, that others in its group would not. It makes this animal agile and a very good pursuit predator. Paleontologist Alan Turner, of the American Museum of Natural History and Stony Brook University, cautions that without a full skeleton, the remains are too fragmentary and scattered to make serious inferences about Dineobellators tail or claws. A couple of vertebrae do give you a glimpse of what the tail looked like, but if you dont have an entire tail, or the part of the backbone that the tail attaches to, Id be reticent to make a definitive statement about tail mobility. But, he says, this study fills in gaps for a period thats lacking in samples and offers a glimpse into the dromeosaurs of the time. David Evans echoed that point. More complete fossils and comparative functional analyses are needed to demonstrate whether Dineobellator was a particularly strong or adept predator. Dineobellator shows us more skeletons are out there, waiting to be found, he says. Evans agrees with the study authors that the fossils in hand demonstrate that close relatives of Velociraptor were diversifying during the last days of the Age of the Dinosaurs. Importantly, it shows that the raptors in the southern part of western North America were distinct from those in the north, and suggests these differences may have been driven by different local ecosystem conditions. Other excavations have given scientists a reasonably good idea of the menagerie of animals that shared Dineobellators ecosystem, an open floodplain habitat in modern day New Mexico that was growing increasingly distant from the receding shoreline of the Western Interior Seaway. Ojoceratops, a horned beast very much like Triceratops, was fairly common as was long necked sauropod Alamosaurus. We have evidence of a small tyrannosaurid, something like T. rex but considerably smaller, Jasinski says. There are duck billed dinosaurs, hadrosaurids, that are relatively common, there are lots of turtles, crocodilians have been common all over the place, and evidence of early birds there as well that would have been living with this thing. As for how Dineobellator and its kin fit in, Turner says thats a matter of speculation. Just size wise, your average North American or Asian dromeosaur might be along the lines of foxes or coyotes, he notes, adding that like those mammals, Dineobellator might have existed in substantial numbers as a kind of ubiquitous predator. That sort of general predatory niche is probably where a lot of these dromeosaurs were falling out. While the individual Dineobellator in the study appears to have met a violent end it seems likely that it and its relatives also enjoyed their share of success. They have sharp teeth and nasty claws on their feet, Turner notes. They arent these big intimidating things, but I still wouldnt want to have a run in with one."}, {"title": "At 67 Million Years Old, Oldest Modern Bird Ever Found Is Natural \u2018Turducken\u2019", "author": "Katherine J.

But the relatives of this pint sized creaturea newly described fossil cheekily dubbed Wonderchickenlived on, helping to seed the enduring, diverse lineage of birds that still fills the skies of the modern world. Now the oldest known member of the contemporary branch of the avian family tree, Wonderchicken formally Asteriornis maastrichtensis could help todays paleontologists better understand how birds weathered the extinction that purged three quarters of all plant and animal species from the surface of the Earth. As such, the petite, ancient fossil represents one of those great discoveries that come up a few times in a lucky lifetime, Bhart Anjan Bhullar, a paleontologist at Yale University who was not involved in the study, tells Cara Giaimo at the New York Times. Birds first showed up on the paleontological scene around 150 million years ago, making their debut with toothsome terrors like Archaeopteryx that likely resembled their more reptilian looking dinosaurian ancestors, reports George Dvorsky for Gizmodo. Sometime during the Cretaceous, though, our feathered friends began to shed their teeth, bony tails and clawed wings in favor of more docile traits. But evidence of these ancient avians has been scant, leaving a gaping hole in the origin story of modern birds. Wonderchicken stands poised to fill this gap. Nestled within a hunk of rock first unearthed in 2000, the fossil languished in obscurity for nearly two decades before being spotted by paleontologists Daniel Field and John Jagt, who decided to investigate its contents. After scanning the block of rock, which had a few broken limb bones poking out, the pair were shocked to discover an almost perfect preserved skull, just a couple inches long. Boasting the face of a chicken or turkey superimposed on the head of a duck, the skull is, in a way, a natural turduckenand remarkably modern, Field, Jagt and their colleagues report this week in the journal Nature. As Field explains to the Guardians Nicola Davis, the birds long, slender legs point to a possible shoreline habitat. This medley of features puts Wonderchicken, which was probably about the size of a seagull, near the likely evolutionary juncture where waterfowl like ducks and landfowl like poultry once split, according to Gizmodo. The fossils fortuitous position in its lineage, as well as the asteroid impact that followed closely on its heels, inspired the team to give it the name Asteriornis, a nod to Asteria, the Greek goddess of falling stars who transformed into a quail. At least one other modern looking bird is known from the Cretaceousa creature called Vegavis iaai, which post dated Wonderchicken by about 200,000 or 300,000 years and left a strew of bones in the rocks of whats now Antarctica. Pried from the sediments of Europe, Asteriornis both expands the avian timeline and hints that todays birds may have evolved in the northern hemisphere, rather than the south, according to the Guardian. Though more fossils may someday change the story, the new findings hint that birds may have acquired some important traits in just the nick of timejust hundreds of thousands of years before that fateful space rock smashed into Earth. This is an incredibly informative specimen, Amy Balanoff, a paleontologist at Johns Hopkins University who wasnt involved in the work, tells Gretchen Vogel at Science magazine. It gives us some clues about what characteristics were key in surviving that catastrophic event."}, {"title": "215-Million-Year-Old, Sharp-Nosed Sea Creature Was Among the Last of Its Kind", "author": "Katherine J.

Armed with serrated blades and some very well tractioned shoes, Druckenmillers team managed to wrest the rocks free with just minutes to spare. Sporting teeny teeth and a long, pointy snout, the odd looking animal within would turn out to be the most complete thalattosaur skeleton described so far in North America, the researchers reported recently in the journal Scientific Reports. Dubbed Gunakadeit joseeae in honor of a sea monster described in Tlingit oral tradition, the species was also one of the last of its kind to swim the seas before thalattosaurs mysteriously died out around 200 million years ago. I was pretty excited to see this fossil, says Tanja Wintrich, a marine reptile paleontologist at the University of Bonn in Germany who wasnt involved in the study. The specimens age and location, she explains, make it really rare  Theres about 20 million years of time near the end of the Triassic when we really dont know what was going on. Initially spotted in May of 2011 by Gene Primaky, an information technology professional for the United States Forest Service in Alaskas Tongass National Forest, the fossil was at first visible as only a neat line of vertebrae poking innocently out of a seaside outcrop. But combined with the rocks age and location, a photo of the bones snapped by geologist Jim Baichtal was enough for Druckenmiller to realize Primaky had probably found a thalattosaur, which immediately set off some paleontological alarm bells. These are animals we dont know much about, says Druckenmiller, who is also a curator at the University of Alaska Museum. And Jim said, we gotta come back and get this. The next month, Druckenmiller returned with his colleagues to Kake, Alaska, to jailbreak the specimen, along with a few hundred pounds of the shoreline rock encasing it. Four painstaking years of fossil preparation later, a collaborator at the Tate Museum in Wyoming had exposed one of the most beautiful, complete vertebrate skeletons ever found in Alaska, Druckenmiller says. Based on the creatures hodgepodge of unusual features, it was definitely a thalattosaur. And it was definitely a new species. In recognition of Kakes indigenous Tlingit people, the team approached representatives from the Sealaska Corporation and the Sealaska Heritage Institute, seeking permission to give the fossil the name Gunakadeit, a part human sea monster who features prominently in Tlingit oral history as an ancestor of modern tribes. With approval from the elders of Kake, a council of traditional scholars thought it was a great idea, says Rosita Worl, an Tlingit anthropologist and president of Sealaska Heritage. Two Tlingit values motivated the decision, Worl explains Haa Shuk\u00e1, or the responsibility to honor ancestors and future generations, and Haa Latseeni, which evokes the strength of body, mind and spirit in the face of change. We thought this was a good way for them to have our oral traditions reinforced  while acknowledging the benefits that can come from science, she says. Primaky then decided to commemorate his mother, Jose\u00e9, with the species name, joseeae. Michelle Stocker, a paleontologist at Virginia Tech who wasnt involved in the study, praised the teams acknowledgement of the fossils indigenous connections. We need to be incorporating people from the area that the fossils are from, she says. We can always do a better job listening. Like other thalattosaursthe descendants of a lineage of reptiles that once lived on land before returning to the oceanthe three foot long Gunakadeit was a full time denizen of the worlds coastal waters, Druckenmiller says. But its bizarrely shaped snout, which tapered into a thin tipped point, clearly set this species apart from its kin. Though other thalattosaurs are known to boast thick, shell crushing chompers or blade like incisors for slicing through flesh, the Gunakadeit fossil harbored only a smattering of small, cone shaped teeth on the back half of its lower jaw. Gunakadeits feeding habits cant be confirmed without a time machine. But Druckenmiller suspects it was probably poking its spindly schnoz into cracks and crevices, rooting for soft bodied prey that it could snatch with its teeth and suck down like a vacuum. The lack of foreign bones in the creatures guts seems to bolster the case for a squishy dietthough Stocker points out that this particular specimen may have simply missed out on a recent meal. While good for rooting out coral dwelling prey, thalattosaurs hard nosed affinity for shallow waters may have also been their undoing. Toward the end of the Triassicnot long after the teams specimen met its own tragic endsea levels plummeted, culling a large portion of Earths coral reefs. While other marine reptiles such as porpoise like ichthyosaurs and long necked plesiosaurs had the evolutionary flexibility to expand into deeper ocean environments, hyper specialized thalattosaurs like Gunakadeit may have struggled to follow suit. To truly test that theory, more fossils are needed, says Lene Liebe Delsett, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Oslo who wasnt involved in the study. Researchers still arent even sure exactly when or where thalattosaurs died outor how the groups scant survivors managed to eke out a living before they finally disappeared. So much new data has come out in the last 10 or 15 years, Delsett says. But there are still a lot of questions we dont have the answers to."}, {"title": "Oldest Known Cave-Dwellers Are 99-Million-Year-Old Cockroaches", "author": "Katherine J. Wu", "date": "February 26, 2020", "doc": "Cockroachesamong the hardiest of insectsmay be among the species guaranteed to outlive us all. But perhaps even more intriguing than the future of these persistent pests is their unusual past. A pair of 99 million year old roaches are now the oldest known animals that unambiguously adapted to life in caves, according to a study published this month in Gondwana Research. The discovery earns the bugs the unique honor of being the only cave dwellers ever described from the Cretaceous, the period spanning 66 to 145 million years ago and the final era of the non avian dinosaurs. Preserved in lumps of amber from the Hukawng Valley in Myanmar, the two newly described species, Mulleriblattina bowangi and Crenocticola svadba, both belong to the Nocticolidae family, a lineage whose members still scuttle around Earths caves today, according Nature News. Boasting a pale body, stunted eyes and wings, and legs that lacked protective spines, Mulleriblattina was clearly a cave inhabitant, study author Peter Vr\u0161ansk\u00fd, a zoologist at the Slovak Academy of Sciences, tells Michael Marshall at New Scientist. The roach, he explains, presumably stopped investing in certain traits that were no longer useful in the cramped, dimly lit cave environment. In their place, however, the insect appears to have sprouted some especially elongated antennae, perhaps to funnel its powers of navigation to the sense of touch. Crenocticola has features that are somewhat less extreme, and may have been less tied to a cave exclusive lifestyle. In fact, both species may have had reason to occasionally venture close to the cave entrance, where they became vulnerable to getting trapped in amber, which comes from tree sap. These dark dwelling insects almost certainly shared their caves with other animals, reports James Urquhart for Cosmos. But their remains have proved more elusive, due in part to poor preservation. And of the Cretaceous fossils that exist, few have features as unambiguously cave adapted as the cockroaches, making it tough for researchers to definitively pinpoint their habitats. Though more evidence is needed, Vr\u0161ansk\u00fd tentatively proposes that the two new cockroaches may have been among the few creatures that survived the mass extinction event that wiped out three quarters of all plant and animal species 66 million years ago, according to Cosmos. That doesnt guarantee, though, that these speciesor even their direct descendantsare still around today. Most, if not all, of todays cave dwellers have evolutionary roots that post date the demise of the dinosaurs. But at least some members of the Nocticolidae familya group that originated about 127 million years agoclearly stuck around, and may have entered caves on several separate occasions. Once that happens, Vr\u0161ansk\u00fd tells New Scientist, evolution becomes very rapid and very strange  bizarre and strange forms originate."}, {"title": "Newly Discovered Tyrannosaur Was Key to the Rise of Giant Meat-Eaters", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "February 10, 2020", "doc": "Paleontologists are uncovering tyrannosaurs at a fast and furious pace. The classic Tyrannosaurus rex may remain the most famous of all, but, in the last year alone, experts have described the bones of pipsqueaks that were far from the top of the food chain, leggy predators that lived in the shadow of other carnivorous giants, and short snouted species that stalked the floodplains of the ancient west over 10 million years before the tyrant lizard king itself. Now University of Calgary paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky has added another dinosaur to the tyrannosaur family, and this particular flesh ripper reveals a surprise about the early days of the ferocious family. The tyrannosaurs that roamed North America during the last 10 million years of the Cretaceous were large, impressive animals with equally menacing names. Dinosaurs such as Gorgosaurus, Albertosaurus, Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus itself became rock stars thanks to multiple, well preserved skeletons found from sites in Montana and the Dakotas, as well as the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. But in the past ten years paleontologists have begun announcing even older tyrannosaurs found much farther south, among the roughly 80 million year old rocks of Utah and New Mexico. There didnt seem to be any tyrannosaurs from rocks of similar age to the north. Until now. The new dinosaurdescribed by University of Calgary graduate student Jared Voris, Zelenitsky and colleaguesis called Thanatotheristes degrootorum. That name might sound like a mouthful, but its fitting for an animal that is one of the oldest known from such a storied lineage. While the species name degrootorum honors amateur fossil hunters John and Sandra De Groot for discovering the fossil, the title Thanatotheristes is a combination of the Greek god of death, Thanatos, and the Greek word for reap. The dinosaur is announced today in Cretaceous Research. The importance of this dinosaur to the tyrannosaur story wasnt immediately clear. In 2010, the De Groot family found parts of a dinosaur skull along the Bow River in southern Alberta. They contacted the Royal Tyrrell Museum, a hub for fossil research in the province that often oversees the excavation of significant finds according to Canadian heritage laws. The museums experts excavated the preserved partspieces of the jaws and back of the skull. The fossil was not initially thought to be new, Zelenitsky says. The jaws, found in the roughly 79 million year old rock of the Foremost Formation, seemed like they belonged to another, already known dinosaur. But, when Voris examined the bones during a trip to the Royal Tyrrell Museum collections, he noticed that these bones werent just another Daspletosaurus specimen. Subtle details of the fossils, such as the shape of the cheek bone and vertical ridges along where the teeth socketed into the upper jaw, indicated that the bones represented an animal never seen before. The new material is very incomplete and the differences between Thanatotheristes and Daspletosaurus are relatively subtle, says Royal Ontario Museum paleontologist David Evans, but, he notes, the age of the new material makes it likely that the animal is something new. The bones are about 2.5 million years older than other tyrannosaurids found in Alberta, and come from rocks that can be stubborn about giving up fossils. My crews have been searching the rocks of the Foremost Formation for almost 20 years, and we have found only teeth and rare isolated bones of tyrannosaurs, Evans says. In life, Thanatotheristes was a large animal. The complete skull of this individual would have measured about three feet in length, Zelenitsky says, and, through comparisons with related tyrannosaurs, the experts estimate a body length of about 26 feet. Thats comparable to the later, well known tyrannosaurs of the area like Gorgosaurus, even if it is on the short size of the largest, 40 foot long T. rex. What really makes Thanatotheristes stand out, however, is when it lived. The tyrannosaurs have a family rooted deep in the Jurassic, over 150 million years ago, but these carnivores remained small for most of their history. It wasnt until late in the Cretaceous that tyrannosaurs really became large and in charge in North America. These dinosaurs are recognized within a subgroup called tyrannosaurids, and Thanatotheristes is among the oldestif not the oldestmember of this group. The recent announcement of large tyrannosaurs of similar age from the south, such as Lythronax from Utah and Dynamoterror from New Mexico, all underscore the fact that tyrannosaurids were imposing predators by about 80 million years ago at the latest. As these new finds are compared to one another, a more complex tyrannosaur story is emerging. The tale of these awesome predators isnt simply a matter of ever increasing size and bone crushing power. There seems to be different types of related tyrannosaurs in different geographic regions, which vary in skull form and shape, Zelenitsky says. While some similar aged tyrannosaurs from southern regions have short, bulldog like snouts, Zelenitsky notes, northern tyrannosaurs such as Thanatotheristes and Daspletosaurus have comparatively longer snouts. The idea that different lineages radiated in different areas of the western interior of North America is bolstered by the new analysis, Evans says, and seems to indicate that different tyrannosaur species lived in distinct areas between 80 and 75 million years ago. That contrasts with the range of the later T. rex which was the lone tyrannosaur from Canada to the southwestern U.S. by 68 million years ago. Why tyrannosaurs in different regions should have noticeably different snout shapes isnt yet clear. Perhaps the changes are related to their ancestry and represent branching off from even older ancestors that have yet to be uncovered. Or perhaps the variations in profile indicate different diets or feeding habits. Long snouted carnivores often bite faster, while short snouted carnivores often bite harder. More fossils are needed to be certain. And they are certainly out there. Somewhere in western North America, in rocks more than 80 million years old, there must be the fossilized remains of the tyrannosaurs that started the familys impressive reign."}, {"title": "Pterosaur Tooth Found in Rare Ancient Squid Fossil", "author": "Katherine J. Wu", "date": "February 4, 2020", "doc": "For one unfortunate pterosaur looking for lunch 150 million years ago, calamari was a risky choice. A new cephalopod fossil, described last week in the journal Scientific Reports, was unearthed with a surprising accessory an embedded tooth, almost certainly torn from the mouth of a flying reptile that triedand failedto grab a quick bite from the sea. The fossilized meal gone awry represents the first known evidence that pterosaurs hunted cephalopods, perhaps to varying degrees of success, Jean Paul Billon Bruyat, an expert in prehistoric reptiles who was not involved in the research, tells Cara Giaimo at the New York Times. Excavated in 2012 from a limestone formation in Bavaria, Germany, the specimen was photographed before disappearing into the collections at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. But last year, Ren\u00e9 Hoffmann, a paleontologist at Ruhr Universit\u00e4t Bochum in Germany, stumbled across the image, depicting what appeared to be a Plesioteuthis subovata cephalopod, a predecessor of todays squids, octopuses and cuttlefish. The 11 inch long creature, Hoffmann notes in an interview with the New York Times, was extremely well preserved, with its ink sac and fins still partially intact. But what struck him the most was the sharp looking tooth protruding from just below the animals head. Based on the size, shape and texture of the dentition, as well as its approximate age, Hoffmann and his colleagues argue that it probably belonged to a Rhamphorhynchus muensteri pterosaur with a hankering for seafood, reports John Pickrell for Science News. Perhaps, after coming across a group of surface skimming cephalopods, the winged reptile dove in for a taste, sinking at least one tooth about half an inch deep into squiddy flesh. But due to either the size or heft of the prey, or poor positioning on the pterosaurs part, the pairs rendezvous was briefand the cephalopod managed to wrest itself free, taking with it a toothy souvenir. Though this liberation may have represented something of a pyrrhic victory, and the prehistoric squid then died of its injuries before fossilizing on the silty ocean floor. Though drawing conclusions about ancient animal encounters can be difficult, Hoffmann and his colleagues support the idea that the detached tooth was the product of violence. However, Jingmai OConnor, a paleontologist at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, advises caution in interpreting the fossil, suggesting at least one other way the ancient cephalopods body might have snared the tooth Perhaps the squid fell to the bottom of the sea when it died and landed on a pterosaur tooth, she tells the New York Times. This more passive fossilization scenario is probably unlikely, as the tooth isnt just resting on the fossil but instead seems to have been jammed in the cephalopod and broken off, explains Riley Black for Scientific American. We may never know the true nature of the tooths demise with certainty. But if the mixed species fossil does indeed immortalize a rare pterosaur prey interaction, it should be considered rare and unique, Ta\u00edssa Rodrigues, a pterosaur researcher at the Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo in Brazil, who was not involved in the study, tells Science News. In the few cases we do have, pterosaurs were the prey of large fish, she says. So it is great to see this the other way around."}, {"title": "Newly Described Meat-Eating Dinosaur Dominated During the Jurassic Period ", "author": "Katherine J. Wu", "date": "January 27, 2020", "doc": "About about 145 million to 200 million years ago during the Jurassic Period, Earths creatures had to contend with one of the most powerful, ferocious predators that ever liveda clawed, flesh eating, sharp toothed behemoth of a dinosaur that stalked the floodplains of what would become Western North America. Despite what Hollywood might have you think, were not talking about Tyrannosaurus rex, which wouldnt appear until the Cretaceous, the period immediately following the Jurassic. But as researchers reported last week in the journal PeerJ, a newly described species called Allosaurus jimmadseni, which lived some 70 million years before its more famous carnivorous cousin, certainly made for a worthy opening act. A. jimmadseni roamed the North American continent between 152 million years ago and 157 million years ago, making it the oldest species of Allosaurus discovered so far, reports George Dvorsky for Gizmodo. Like other members of the Allosaurus genus, A. jimmadseni boasted a suite of truly terrifying features. Study co authors Mark Loewen, a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum of Utah, and Daniel Chure, a paleontologist at the Dinosaur National Monument in Utah, estimate that A. jimmadseni weighed up to 4,000 pounds and reached 26 to 29 feet in length at full size. This dino stomped around on two, three toed feet and hunted prey with its long, curved claws and about 80 serrated teeth. For perspective, the later arriving T. rex maxed out closer to 40 feet in length and 20,000 pounds in weight. This deadly combo probably equipped Allosaurus to take down their fair share of hefty creatures, including, perhaps, the spiky tailed Stegosaurus.   Assigning specimens to the Allosaurus family tree has long been a point of contention in the field, according to a statement. While some have argued that as many as 12 separate species exist, the new study recognizes only twoA. jimmadseni and A. fragilis, which evolved some 5 million years later. Both were top predators in their respective ecosystems and represent some of the best known dinosaurs in paleontology. But the older A. jimmadseni had a weaker skull that probably slightly weakened its ability to hunt, Loewen tells Courtney Linder at Popular Mechanics. So when A. fragilis showed up, he explains, it probably outcompeted its predecessor.   To ensure theyd actually come across a new species, analyzed more than 20,000 Allosaurus bones, gathered from all around the world, including those from two nearly complete specimens, including one nicknamed Big Al housed at the Museum of the Rockies in Montana. Originally designated as A. fragilis, Big Al, as well as a second Allosaurus dubbed Big Al Two, have now been reassigned as A. jimmadseni, a name the team chose to honor late Utah State Paleontologist James Madsen, Jr. Everybody knows Allosaurus, or thinks they know Allosaurus, says Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who wasnt involved in the study. But here we are, nearly 150 years after the first Allosaurus bones were found, and after dozens and dozens of skeletons have been collected, and it turns out there is another species. There are many more dinosaurs out there to find."}, {"title": "World\u2019s Oldest Scorpions May Have Moved From Sea to Land 437 Million Years Ago", "author": "Katherine J. Wu", "date": "January 16, 2020", "doc": "Half a billion years ago, the continents were quiet. Earths animalsrepresented largely by shelled mollusks, armored arthropods, and a smattering of wriggly, jawless fishbreathed with gills, not lungs, and hunted their prey at sea. But sometime, possibly during the Silurian the geologic period spanning 443 million to 416 million years ago an intrepid creature, likely equipped with sturdy limbs and a set of gas cycling tubes that could leech oxygen from air, decided to crawl ashore. In habitually venturing out of the ocean, this animal paved a habitat hopping path for countless lineages of land dwellers to comeincluding the one that eventually led to us. The identity of this pioneering terrestrial trekker has long perplexed paleontologists. Over the years, several candidates have come forth, all known only by their fossilized remains. Two of the most promising possibilities include many legged millipedes, eager to snack on the predecessors of todays plants, and stinger tipped scorpionsone of the worlds oldest arachnids, the group that also includes spiders. But when and how these arthropods first made that crucial transition from water to land remains an unsolved puzzle. Now, new research is pushing the scorpion timeline further back than ever before and may help pinpoint the traits that helped these pint sized predators make a living on land. Today in Scientific Reports, paleontologists announce the discovery of the oldest known scorpions to date a pristinely preserved pair of 437 million year old fossils, complete with what seem to be venom packed tails. The dangerous looking duo, newly christened Parioscorpio venator, bear a remarkable resemblance to modern species, showing scorpions hit upon a successful survival strategy early in their evolution, says study author Andrew Wendruff, a paleontologist at Otterbein University. Though Parioscorpio may have spent some of their time at sea, bits of their anatomy, including internal structures used for breathing and digesting food, hint that these ancient animals were capable of scuttling ashoreperhaps, even, to hunt the few creatures that preceded them on land. Together with other, younger fossils from the same geologic period, the ancient arachnids suggest that scorpions have looked and acted in much the same way ever since they first appeared on Earth. Its always exciting to see a new oldest, says Danita Brandt, an arthropod paleontologist at Michigan State University who wasnt involved in the study. This one is particularly exciting because its an organism living at this very interesting transition from water to land. First buried in the sediments of whats now Wisconsin, a region that contained an extensive reef system during the early Silurian, the Parioscorpio pair spent the next 437 million years encased in rock. Revealed alongside a spectacular trove of other fossils in the 1980s, the specimens then disappeared into a drawer at the University of Wisconsin Geology Museum, where Wendruff would happen upon them some three decades later. After wearily sifting through troves of trilobitesearly marine arthropods that dominate many excavation sitesWendruff, then a graduate student, was astounded to see these tiny little things that looked like inch long scorpions, he recalls. And thats what they were. Actually convincing himself of his find, however, was a long process. There were a lot of organisms from the site that were marine  but arachnids live on land, he says. I kind of didnt expect it, and I kind of didnt believe it. Six foot long marine sea scorpions skulked the ancient oceans 467 million years ago, but they were not true scorpions of the land based lineage that survives today. Early scorpions could blur the line between sea  and land dwellers. Something had to crawl out of the water first, perhaps adopting an amphibian like lifestyle. Parioscorpios physique, a mashup of marine and terrestrial traits, hints it was a good candidate for this double life. The heads of more recent scorpion species are adorned with multiple rows of beady, pinprick eyes. But Parioscorpio saw the world through bulbous, front facing compound eyes, similar to the ones still found on todays insects and crustaceans, as well as its ocean based ancestors. Most of Parioscorpios other body parts, however, looked more contemporary. Like the scorpions that plague us today, this ancient animal boasted clawed pincers and a tail that likely tapered into a venomous stinger though the actual tip, if it existed, has been lost to time. Even its insides were a match The fossils were so exquisitely entombed that Wendruff could still see the delicate outlines of a simple tube like gut and a series of hourglass shaped structures that might have housed their heartsall of which resembled the innards of modern land dwelling scorpions. The amazing preservation of the internal anatomy  reiterates how the scorpion ground plan has stayed the same, not just on the outside, but the inside, too, says Lorenzo Prendini, a scorpion evolution expert at the American Museum of Natural History who helped uncover another batch of Silurian fossils from this lineage, but wasnt involved in the new study. Its an if it aint broke, dont fix it mentality. But Brandt, Prendini and Wendruff are all hesitant to dub Parioscorpio a pure landlubber like the more recent members of its lineage. While the fossils respiratory and circulatory systems hint that these scorpions were probably capable of breathing air, that doesnt mean they actually didpart time, full time or otherwise. There isnt anything that unambiguously tells you whether they were fully aquatic, terrestrial or amphibious, Prendini says. Horseshoe crabs, for instance, favor the salty ocean, but are known to make occasional forays onto land, where they can remain for up to four days. To definitively categorize Parioscorpio, researchers would need to find a fossil with either water filtering gillsthe hallmark of a marine lifestyleor air cycling lungs like todays scorpions have. Unfortunately, Wendruff says, the two breathing structures tend to look a lot alike, especially after millennia underground, and he and his colleagues couldnt identify either in the specimens. But even if Parioscorpio wasnt yet living on land, it was equipped for terrestrial lifeputting it, perhaps, on the evolutionary cusp of the major marine terrestrial transition. Over the years, plenty of other animals have made a similar hop ashore, Brandt points out. To figure out more about how that happened, maybe its time to put them all together, she says. What do all these things crawling out of the water have in common?"}, {"title": "Why This 18th-Century Naturalist Believed He\u2019d Discovered an Eyewitness to the Biblical Flood ", "author": "Hans-Dieter Sues", "date": "January 16, 2020", "doc": "Fossils have fascinated and puzzled humans since prehistoric times. They frequently have strange shapes unlike anything we know in the world around us today. And their mystery has confounded naturalists and scholars for centuries. Take for example, a strange skeleton that was uncovered near a small town in southern Germany in the early 18th century by a Swiss scholar who said hed discovered the bony frame of a man that had drowned in the flood recounted in the Bibles book of Genesis. Archaeological discoveries show that early members of our species already collected fossils and even used them for personal adornment. Throughout human history and across cultures, fossils were prized as amulets or used in folk medicine. For example, tongue stones, the teeth of the extinct shark Carcharocles megalodon from the island of Malta, were long thought to protect against poisons and snake bites. But what are fossils? Philosophers in ancient Greece were the first to ponder this question. Yet neither the Greeks nor those of later ages answered it convincingly. Were fossils mere plays of nature, or ludes naturae? How did they form? Was it possible that they were the remains of ancient animals and plants? Aristotle held that fossils grew within rocks due to an organic force or seed. Following him, most scholars posited the existence of such a force, or vis plastica, capable of creating structures that looked like animals and plants. Starting in the late Middle Ages, however, some forward thinking savants started to see fossils as the remains of once living creatures. The great Italian artist and polymath Leonardo Da Vinci was an early proponent of this idea. This led to other theories based on observations of fossils in rock layers. Why were they sometimes found high in the mountains? Early scientists looked to the biblical story that told of a flood that was said to have covered the entire earth, and thus, to 17th century scholars such as the Danish physician Nicholas Steno and the German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, it made perfect sense that fossils on mountain sides and deep in the ground had been left there in the wake of the flood. The English scholar John Woodward further developed this idea in his 1695 Essay Toward a Natural History of the Earth, where he proposed that once the waters began to recede, objects sank according to their weight, with the heaviest ones ending up at the bottom. This scenario, Woodward surmised, explained the layering of rocks observed in many places. Woodwards essay fascinated the Swiss physician and naturalist Johann Jakob Scheuchzer 1672 1733 so much so that he translated the essay into Latin, then the language of learning across Europegiving it wide readership. After studies in medicine and mathematics, Scheuchzer, a native of Z\u00fcrich, had settled in his hometown to practice medicine. He eventually became the towns physician and a professor at the local university. Incredibly curious about the world around him, Scheuchzer amassed a large collection of fossils, which led him to ponder their origin. And therein lies the tale of how Scheuchzer came to insist that the fossil he had acquired must have been a human witness to the flood. For Scheuchzer, the biblical flood was the most plausible mechanism for the formation of fossils. He set out to gather scientific evidencea proposition that aroused consternation among his fellow townspeople who regarded Scripture as the literal truth and in no need for verification. Indeed, the Z\u00fcrich censors denied permission to print one of Scheuchzers books until he had purged all references to the Copernican theory of the solar system. In his quest, Scheuchzer would get quite ahead of himself when he came across a fossil that, in his eyes, offered incontrovertible evidence that humans had perished in the biblical flood. The fossil in question is an incompletely preserved strange skeleton that had been discovered in a limestone quarry near the small town of \u00d6hningen in southern Germany. Scheuchzer identified his prize fossil as Homo diluvii testis, meaning man, witness of the Flood. In 1726 he published a broadside to announce his discovery. In his great work on the natural history of the Bible, Physica sacra of 1731, Scheuchzer cited the Reverend Johann Martin Miller as expressing the hope that the sad bony frame of an old sinner would soften the heart of new children of evil Scheuchzers interpretation of the \u00d6hningen skeleton soon came under scrutiny. Other scholars considered the fossil the remains of a fish or a lizard. But Scheuchzer would go to his grave in 1733 convinced of his finding. It was the great French zoologist and paleontologist Georges Cuvier, who finally demonstrated the true identity of the witness of the flood. After Scheuchzers death, the \u00d6hningen fossil had been acquired for the collections of Teylers Museum in Haarlem in the Netherlands, where it is still exhibited today. When that country was conquered by Napoleons army, Cuvier, then the emperors inspector of institutions for higher education, visited Haarlem in 1811. With permission of the museum director, Cuvier examined Scheuchzers fossil and set out to expose the bones more clearly from the soft surrounding rock. Using a sharp needle, he uncovered the shoulder girdle and both arms of the animal. With that, Cuvier established the decidedly non human skeleton was, in fact, that of an extinct giant salamander. Today there are five living species of giant salamanders, four in East Asia and one, the Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis, in the central and eastern United States. The Japanese giant salamander, Andrias japonicus, can attain a total length of about five feet. The extinct species represented by the skeleton from \u00d6hningen, now named Andrias scheuchzeri, is so similar to the Japanese one that some scientists regarded the two as a single species. The rocks from which Scheuchzers fossil was collected date from the Miocene Epoch and are about 13 million years old. They formed in a lake inside an extinct volcanic crater lined by forest. Historians have puzzled over how a well respected medical doctor could possibly have mistaken the skeleton of a giant salamander for that of a human. A plausible explanation is that, in his eagerness to find scientific proof of the biblical flood, Scheuchzer must have seen only what he wanted to see. Furthermore, giant salamanders were still unknown in Europe at that time. While posterity remembers him mainly for his discovery of the alleged witness of the flood, Scheuchzers interpretation of fossils as the remains of once living beings rather than products of some mysterious force was well ahead of his times. He was among the first to open humanitys eyes to the fact that life has an inconceivably long history on our planet."}, {"title": "Teenage T.

As such, exactly how these infamous behemothswhich likely entered the world as pigeon sized hatchlingsattained these staggering sizes has long been mysterious. So Woodward and her team decided to re analyze two dinosaur specimens housed at Illinoiss Burpee Museum of Natural History. The pair, nicknamed Jane and Petey, are sleek, slender, and around 20 feet in length, bearing some resemblance to T. rex, but middling in size. As such, while most researchers believe Jane and Petey are probably T. rex teens, others have previously contended they were adult members of another species entirelya diminutive dinosaur called Nanotyrannus. But when the researchers analyzed microstructures in the specimens leg bones, they discovered that both Jane and Petey almost certainly juveniles at the time of their death. The fibers in their bones were haphazard, and teemed with ancient traces of blood vesselssigns that the dinosaurian duo were in the midst of rapid growth. This study is another nail in the coffin of Nanotyrannus, Steve Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh who reviewed the new study for publication, tells National Geographics Michael Greshko in an email. Like trees, bones archive their growth in rings, typically laid down during lean winter months, Greshko reports. By counting these fossilized halos, the researchers determined that Jane, the more complete specimen, was probably around 13 years old when it died, and Petey was about 15 years old. That puts them around a decade shy of their full sizewell within the bounds of adolescence, reports Leah Crane for New Scientist. Other fossils have hinted that T. rex typically lived until age 30 or so. The bone rings, however, werent evenly spaced. Some years Jane and Petey did a lot of growing, other years they didnt, Holly Woodward tells Business Insiders Aylin Woodward. What stalled the dinosaurs development isnt entirely clear, but Holly Woodward thinks it was likely linked to how much prey was available in a given year. If thats the case, hitting the pause button could have been a clever strategy, Holly Woodward tells Greshko. Rather than starving and dying one year because you dont have the resource abundance, you just dont grow, she says. Over the course of many years, however, this stop and go process transformed limber, fleet footed juveniles into bulky, lumbering giants that hunted mostly with their bone crushing jaws, Mark Norell, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History who wasnt involved in the study, tells Business Insider. Jane and Petey may have been just on the cusp of this metamorphosis, the lions share of which occurred in the late T. rex teens, when the dinosaurs could gain almost five pounds per day. The tyrant kings may have ruled the Cretaceous. But royalty isnt everything. As Holly Woodward tells Greshko, Even for a dinosaur as famous as Tyrannosaurus rex  theres still a lot to learn."}, {"title": "The Top Ten Scientific Discoveries of the Decade", "author": "Jay Bennett", "date": "December 31, 2019", "doc": "Millions of new scientific research papers are published every year, shedding light on everything from the evolution of stars to the ongoing impacts of climate change to the health benefits or determents of coffee to the tendency of your cat to ignore you. With so much research coming out every year, it can be difficult to know what is significant, what is interesting but largely insignificant, and what is just plain bad science. But over the course of a decade, we can look back at some of the most important and awe inspiring areas of research, often expressed in multiple findings and research papers that lead to a true proliferation of knowledge. Here are ten of the biggest strides made by scientists in the last ten years. The human family tree expanded significantly in the past decade, with fossils of new hominin species discovered in Africa and the Philippines. The decade began with the discovery and identification of Australopithecus sediba, a hominin species that lived nearly two million years ago in present day South Africa. Matthew Berger, the son of paleoanthropologist Lee Berger, stumbled upon the first fossil of the species, a right clavicle, in 2008, when he was only 9 years old. A team then unearthed more fossils from the individual, a young boy, including a well preserved skull, and A. sediba was described by Lee Berger and colleagues in 2010. The species represents a transitionary phase between the genus Australopithecus and the genus Homo, with some traits of the older primate group but a style of walking that resembled modern humans. Also discovered in South Africa by a team led by Berger, Homo naledi lived much more recently, some 335,000 to 236,000 years ago, meaning it may have overlapped with our own species, Homo sapiens. The species, first discovered in the Rising Star Cave system in 2013 and described in 2015, also had a mix of primitive and modern features, such as a small brain case about one third the size of Homo sapiens and a large body for the time, weighing approximately 100 pounds and standing up to five feet tall. The smaller Homo luzonensis three to four feet tall lived in the Philippines some 50,000 to 67,000 years ago, overlapping with several species of hominin. The first H. luzonensis fossils were originally identified as Homo sapiens, but a 2019 analysis determined that the bones belonged to an entirely unknown species. These three major finds in the last ten years suggest that the bones of more species of ancient human relatives are likely hidden in the caves and sediment deposits of the world, waiting to be discovered. When Albert Einstein first published the general theory of relativity in 1915, he likely couldnt have imagined that 100 years later, astronomers would test the theorys predictions with some of the most sophisticated instruments ever builtand the theory would pass each test. General relativity describes the universe as a fabric of space time that is warped by large masses. Its this warping that causes gravity, rather than an internal property of mass as Isaac Newton thought. One prediction of this model is that the acceleration of masses can cause ripples in space time, or the propagation of gravitational waves. With a large enough mass, such as a black hole or a neutron star, these ripples may even be detected by astronomers on Earth. In September 2015, the LIGO and Virgo collaboration detected gravitational waves for the first time, propagating from a pair of merging black holes some 1.3 billion light years away. Since then, the two instruments have detected several additional gravitational waves, including one from a two merging neutron stars. Another prediction of general relativityone that Einstein himself famously doubtedis the existence of black holes at all, or points of gravitational collapse in space with infinite density and infinitesimal volume. These objects consume all matter and light that strays too close, creating a disk of superheated material falling into the black hole. In 2017, the Event Horizon Telescope collaborationa network of linked radio telescopes around the worldtook observations that would later result in the first image of the environment around a black hole, released in April 2019. Scientists have been predicating the effects of burning coal and fossil fuels on the temperature of the planet for over 100 years. A 1912 issue of Popular Mechanics contains an article titled Remarkable Weather of 1911 The Effect of the Combustion of Coal on the ClimateWhat Scientists Predict for the Future, which has a caption that reads The furnaces of the world are now burning about 2,000,000,000 tons of coal a year. When this is burned, uniting with oxygen, it adds about 7,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere yearly. This tends to make the air a more effective blanket for the earth and to raise its temperature. The effect may be considerable in a few centuries. Just one century later, and the effect is considerable indeed. Increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have produced hotter global temperatures, with the last five years 2014 to 2018 being the hottest years on record. 2016 was the hottest year since the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA started recording global temperature 139 years ago. The effects of this global change include more frequent and destructive wildfires, more common droughts, accelerating polar ice melt and increased storm surges. California is burning, Venice is flooding, urban heat deaths are on the rise, and countless coastal and island communities face an existential crisisnot to mention the ecological havoc wreaked by climate change, stifling the planets ability to pull carbon back out of the atmosphere. In 2015, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC reached a consensus on climate action, known as the Paris Agreement. The primary goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre industrial levels. To achieve this goal, major societal transformations will be required, including replacing fossil fuels with clean energy such as wind, solar and nuclear reforming agricultural practices to limit emissions and protect forested areas and perhaps even building artificial means of pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Ever since the double helix structure of DNA was revealed in the early 1950s, scientists have hypothesized about the possibility of artificially modifying DNA to change the functions of an organism. The first approved gene therapy trial occurred in 1990, when a four year old girl had her own white blood cells removed, augmented with the genes that produce an enzyme called adenosine deaminase ADA, and then reinjected into her body to treat ADA deficiency, a genetic condition that hampers the immune systems ability to fight disease. The patients body began producing the ADA enzyme, but new white blood cells with the corrected gene were not produced, and she had to continue receiving injections. Now, genetic engineering is more precise and available than ever before, thanks in large part to a new tool first used to modify eukaryotic cells complex cells with a nucleus in 2013 CRISPR Cas9. The gene editing tool works by locating a targeted section of DNA and cutting out that section with the Cas9 enzyme. An optional third step involves replacing the deleted section of DNA with new genetic material. The technique can be used for a wide range of applications, from increasing the muscle mass of livestock, to producing resistant and fruitful crops, to treating diseases like cancer by removing a patients immune system cells, modifying them to better fight a disease, and reinjecting them into the patients body. In late 2018, Chinese researchers led by He Jiankui announced that they had used CRISPR Cas9 to genetically modify human embryos, which were then transferred to a womans uterus and resulted in the birth of twin girlsthe first gene edited babies. The twins genomes were modified to make the girls more resistant to HIV, although the genetic alterations may have also resulted in unintended changes. The work was widely condemned by the scientific community as unethical and dangerous, revealing a need for stricter regulations for how these powerful new tools are used, particularly when it comes to changing the DNA of embryos and using those embryos to birth live children. Spacecraft and telescopes have revealed a wealth of information about worlds beyond our own in the last decade. In 2015, the New Horizons probe made a close pass of Pluto, taking the first nearby observations of the dwarf planet and its moons. The spacecraft revealed a surprisingly dynamic and active world, with icy mountains reaching up to nearly 20,000 feet and shifting plains that are no more than 10 million years oldmeaning the geology is constantly changing. The fact that Plutowhich is an average of 3.7 billion miles from the sun, about 40 times the distance of Earthis so geologically active suggests that even cold, distant worlds could get enough energy to heat their interiors, possibly harboring subsurface liquid water or even life. A bit closer to home, the Cassini spacecraft orbited Saturn for 13 years, ending its mission in September 2017 when NASA intentionally plunged the spacecraft into the atmosphere of Saturn so it would burn up rather than continue orbiting the planet once it had exhausted its fuel. During its mission, Cassini discovered the processes that feed Saturns rings, observed a global storm encircle the gas giant, mapped the large moon Titan and found some of the ingredients for life in the plumes of icy material erupting from the watery moon Enceladus. In 2016, a year before the end of the Cassini mission, the Juno spacecraft arrived at Jupiter, where it has been measuring the magnetic field and atmospheric dynamics of the largest planet in the solar system to help scientists understand how Jupiterand everything else around the sunoriginally formed. In 2012, the Curiosity rover landed on Mars, where it has made several significant discoveries, including new evidence of past water on the red planet, the presence of organic molecules that could be related to life, and mysterious seasonal cycles of methane and oxygen that hint at a dynamic world beneath the surface. In 2018, the European Space Agency announced that ground penetrating radar data from the Mars Express spacecraft provided strong evidence that a liquid reservoir of water exists underground near the Martian south pole. Meanwhile, two space telescopes, Kepler and TESS, have discovered thousands of planets orbiting other stars. Kepler launched in 2009 and ended its mission in 2018, revealing mysterious and distant planets by measuring the decrease in light when they pass in front of their stars. These planets include hot Jupiters, which orbit close to their stars in just days or hours mini Neptunes, which are between the size of Earth and Neptune and may be gas, liquid, solid or some combination and super Earths, which are large rocky planets that astronomers hope to study for signs of life. TESS, which launched in 2018, continues the search as Keplers successor. The space telescope has already discovered hundreds of worlds, and it could find 10,000 or even 20,000 before the end of the mission. The decade began with a revolution in paleontology as scientists got their first look at the true colors of dinosaurs. First, in January 2010, an analysis of melanosomesorganelles that contain pigmentsin the fossilized feathers of Sinosauropteryx, a dinosaur that lived in China some 120 to 125 million years ago, revealed that the prehistoric creature had reddish brown tones and stripes along its tail. Shortly after, a full body reconstruction revealed the colors of a small feathered dinosaur that lived some 160 million years ago, Anchiornis, which had black and white feathers on its body and a striking plume of red feathers on its head. The study of fossilized pigments has continued to expose new information about prehistoric life, hinting at potential animal survival strategies by showing evidence of countershading and camouflage. In 2017, a remarkably well preserved armored dinosaur which lived about 110 million years ago, Borealopelta, was found to have reddish brown tones to help blend into the environment. This new ability to identify and study the colors of dinosaurs will continue to play an important role in paleontological research as scientists study the evolution of past life. In November 2018, measurement scientists around the world voted to officially changed the definition of a kilogram, the fundamental unit of mass. Rather than basing the kilogram off of an objecta platinum iridium alloy cylinder about the size of a golf ballthe new definition uses a constant of nature to set the unit of mass. The change replaced the last physical artifact used to define a unit of measure. The meter bar was replaced in 1960 by a specific number of wavelengths of radiation from krypton, for example, and later updated to define a meter according to the distance light travels in a tiny fraction of a second. By using a sophisticated weighing machine known as a Kibble balance, scientists were able to precisely measure a kilogram according to the electromagnetic force required to hold it up. This electric measurement could then be expressed in terms of Plancks constant, a number originally used by Max Planck to calculate bundles of energy coming from stars. The kilogram was not the only unit of measure that was recently redefined. The changes to the International System of Units, which officially went into effect in May 2019, also changed the definition for the ampere, the standard unit of electric current the kelvin unit of temperature and the mole, a unit of amount of substance used in chemistry. The changes to the kilogram and other units will allow more precise measurements for small amounts of material, such as pharmaceuticals, as well as give scientists around the world access to the fundamental units, rather than defining them according to objects that must be replicated and calibrated by a small number of labs. In 2010, scientists gained a new tool to study the ancient past and the people who inhabited it. Researchers used a hair preserved in permafrost to sequence the genome of a man who lived some 4,000 years ago in what is now Greenland, revealing the physical traits and even the blood type of a member of one of the first cultures to settle in that part of the world. The first nearly complete reconstruction of a genome from ancient DNA opened the door for anthropologists and geneticists to learn more about the cultures of the distant past than ever before. Extracting ancient DNA is a major challenge. Even if genetic material such as hair or skin is preserved, it is often contaminated with the DNA of microbes from the environment, so sophisticated sequencing techniques must be used to isolate the ancient humans DNA. More recently, scientists have used the petrous bone of the skull, a highly dense bone near the ear, to extract ancient DNA. Thousands of ancient human genomes have been sequenced since the first success in 2010, revealing new details about the rise and fall of lost civilizations and the migrations of people around the globe. Studying ancient genomes has identified multiple waves of migration back and forth across the frozen Bering land bridge between Siberia and Alaska between 5,000 and 15,000 years ago. Recently, the genome of a young girl in modern Denmark was sequenced from a 5,700 year old piece of birch tar used as chewing gum, which also contained her mouth microbes and bits of food from one of her last meals. This decade included the worst outbreak of Ebola virus diseases in history. The epidemic is believed to have begun with a single case of an 18 month old boy in Guinea infected by bats in December 2013. The disease quickly spread to neighboring countries, reaching the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone by July 2014, providing an unprecedented opportunity for the transmission of the disease to a large number of people. Ebola virus compromises the immune system and can cause massive hemorrhaging and multiple organ failure. Two and a half years after the initial case, more than 28,600 people had been infected, resulting in at least 11,325 deaths, according to the CDC. The epidemic prompted health officials to redouble their efforts to find an effective vaccine to fight Ebola. A vaccine known as Ervebo, made by the pharmaceutical company Merck, was tested in a clinical trial in Guinea performed toward the end of the outbreak in 2016 that proved the vaccine effective. Another Ebola outbreak was declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in August 2018, and the ongoing epidemic has spread to become the deadliest since the West Africa outbreak, with 3,366 reported cases and 2,227 deaths as of December 2019. Ervebo has been used in the DRC to fight the outbreak on an expanded access or compassionate use basis. In November 2019, Ervebo was approved by the European Medicines Agency EMA, and a month later it was approved in the U.S. by the FDA. In addition to a preventative vaccine, researchers have been seeking a cure for Ebola in patients who have already been infected by the disease. Two treatments, which involve a one time delivery of antibodies to prevent Ebola from infecting a patients cells, have recently shown promise in a clinical trial in the DRC. With a combination of vaccines and therapeutic treatments, healthcare officials hope to one day eradicate the viral infection for good. Over the past several decades, physicists have worked tirelessly to model the workings of the universe, developing what is known as the Standard Model. This model describes four basic interactions of matter, known as the fundamental forces. Two are familiar in everyday life the gravitational force and the electromagnetic force. The other two, however, only exert their influence inside the nuclei of atoms the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force. Part of the Standard Model says that there is a universal quantum field that interacts with particles, giving them their masses. In the 1960s, theoretical physicists including Fran\u00e7ois Englert and Peter Higgs described this field and its role in the Standard Model. It became known as the Higgs field, and according to the laws of quantum mechanics, all such fundamental fields should have an associated particle, which came to be known as the Higgs boson. Decades later, in 2012, two teams using the Large Hadron Collider at CERN to conduct particle collisions reported the detection of a particle with the predicted mass of the Higgs boson, providing substantial evidence for the existence of the Higgs field and Higgs boson. In 2013, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Englert and Higgs for the theoretical discovery of a mechanism that contributes to our understanding of the origin of mass of subatomic particles, and which recently was confirmed through the discovery of the predicted fundamental particle. As physicists continue to refine the Standard Model, the function and discovery of the Higgs boson will remain a fundamental part of how all matter gets its mass, and therefore, how any matter exists at all."}, {"title": "Our Top Ten Stories of 2019", "author": "Meilan Solly", "date": "December 26, 2019", "doc": "The last year of the decade was filled with a dizzying array of headlines, from the January government shutdown to the devastating fire at Notre Dame Cathedral, the discovery of a new human ancestor species, the first ever image of a black hole, the U.S. Womens Soccer Team World Cup victory, the Amazon rainforests unprecedented fire season and the end of a new Star Wars trilogy.

Populated by immigrants and their Canadian born children, the community likely acted as a refuge from the rampant racism of pre World War II Vancouver but was abandoned around 1942, when, as Muckle told Smithsonian magazines Brigit Katz earlier this year, its residents were incarcerated or sent to road camps. The June issue of Smithsonian magazine marked the 50th anniversary of the moon landing with a deep dive on the Apollo 11 mission by Charles Fishman. As the author of One Giant Leap The Impossible Mission That Flew Us to the Moon asked readers, The leap to the Moon in the 1960s was an astonishing accomplishment. But why? What made it astonishing?  What exactly was the hard part? Fishman outlines the answer to these questions in an immersive, behind the scenes exploration of the race to the moon, documenting everything from President John F. Kennedys personal lack of interest in space to the Soviets secretive launch of an unmanned craft called Luna 15 just days before Apollo 11s entry into orbit. Tourists stopping by the long awaited Hall of FossilsDeep Time exhibition at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History are welcomed by an enormous sequoia fossil dated to some 16 million years ago. Containing about 260 tree rings, the slab represents the culmination of curators efforts to place dinosaurs, megafauna and other relics of the past in perspective, offering visitors the opportunity to fully absorb just how much time has passed since the sequoia tree first sprang out of the earth in what is now central Oregon. Time is so vast, Smithsonian paleobotanist Scott Wing told contributing writer Riley Black in June, that this giant slab of a tree is just scratching the surface. Contrary to popular belief, one dog year isnt actually equivalent to seven human years. To come up with a more accurate aging formula, geneticists led by Tina Wang of the University of California, San Diego, compared humans epigenetic clocks, or estimated age as indicated by a phenomenon called DNA methylation rates, to that of canines. The team found that young puppies and human infants have similar methylation rates, but these figures diverge over time, with dogs epigenetic clocks speeding up during the first year of life before slowing to align more closely with humans in later stages of life. Overall, the researchers reported, a 2 year old dog is roughly equivalent to a 42 year old human, while a 10 year old dog is the equivalent of a 67.8 year old person. \n\nCalculate\n Only enter numbers greater than zero Your dogs age in human years is    Smithsonian magazines JanuaryFebruary 2019 issue focused on America at war, exploring the nations involvement in conflicts through infographics, features, polls and photo stories.

Drawing on diaries written by Confederate soldiers, Levin, author of Searching for Black Confederates The Civil Wars Most Persistent Myth, keys in on the role slavery played in the war. Some of the enslaved escaped once on the friendlier battleground of Pennsylvania, but others, perhaps out of fear, remained close to their owners.

Wu", "date": "December 23, 2019", "doc": "The first fossil was so stunning that Brian Hebert nearly missed the second. Tucked into the stump of a 300 million year old tree was a neat line of vertebrae, sprouting a series of delicate, wispy ribs. A smattering of belly scales freckled the space below, paving a path to a pelvis and a pair of petite thigh bones. These were the first known remains of Dendromaia unamakiensis, an early land dwelling vertebrate that likely resembled a foot long monitor lizard. I can close my eyes and remember it like it was yesterday, says Hebert, an amateur fossil hunter who happened upon the tree in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, in 2017. It was three dimensional, right in front of my face. Then Hebert spotted another set of bones that stopped him dead in his tracks a tiny, inch long skull, nestled into the space where a left femur met a pubic bone. This skull, Hebert realized, belonged to a juvenile, curled up against what was probably its mother. Hebert didnt know it at the time, but what he found would soon become the prime piece of evidence in a paper published today in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution arguing that parental careinvesting resources in offspring after birthis at least 306 million years old. Plenty of todays amniotes, the group that includes mammals, birds and reptiles, fuss over their young. While the evolutionary strategy is costly, it increases the chances that an animals offspring will succeed, and parenting has often been considered by researchers to be a trait of more modern animals. But this ancient fossil duo, which dates back to the era before dinosaurs when our egg laying predecessors first crawled ashore, suggests the origins of this nurturing behavior is much more deeply rooted in this branch of the tree of life. We tend to think of animals in this part of the past as primitive or simple, says Jackie Lungmus, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Chicago who wasnt involved in the study. But they deserve more credit. Even back then  these animals were probably doing a lot of the things that animals still do today. Even before hed left the stump, Hebert, whos been scouring the Nova Scotian landscape for fossils since childhood, knew he had discovered something big. To confirm the find, he recruited paleontologists Hillary Maddin and Arjan Mann, who carefully transported the bones back to their laboratory at Carleton University in Ottawa for further analysis. Under the microscope, the nature of the fossils was unmistakable, Mann says. They belonged to two individuals of the same species, one fully grown and the other young, and bore the hallmark characteristics of varanopids, an extinct family of pre mammalian ancestors with reptilian features that lived around 300 million years ago. But the adult looked distinct enough from its relatives to earn its own genus name Dendromaia, or the mother in the tree. The fossils exquisite preservation hinted that the pair had died a sudden death, perhaps during a storm that flooded their stumpy hideout with suffocating sediments, preserving their final moment in freeze frame. Swaddled between the adults tail and hind leg, the smaller specimen appeared as though it was being purposefully guarded from harm. It looked a lot like denning behavior, says Maddin, who found it hard not to think of a protective mother cradling her baby. Mann, her graduate student, casually quipped that theyd found the earliest evidence of parental care. Hed meant it as a joke, but his words reminded Maddin of a similar fossil unearthed in South Africa a decade prior a Heleosaurus specimen that had died with its tail curled around four juveniles during the Permian, 260 million years ago. Though separated by about 45 million years, both fossils were varanopidsand both, it seemed, had died sheltering smaller versions of themselves. The researchers who documented the Heleosaurus find had pinpointed the remains as a probable family group, giving Mann and Maddin more confidence that theyd stumbled on something similar and more ancient. Mann had hit not on a punchline, but a viable hypothesis Since their earliest days, varanopids may have made parenting a priority. Some researchers have previously presented even older evidence of parental care in invertebrates, but Dendromaia could represent the earliest known example of an amniote parent looking after live young. Without a time machine, researchers cant know what these animals were actually doing at their times of death. Clear cut behavioral evidence, after all, isnt something that gets preserved in rocks, says Stephanie Drumheller Horton, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, who wasnt involved in the study. It remains possible, for instance, that the two Dendromaia werent a family unit at all, but two unacquainted refugees seeking safe harbor from a bad storm. Similar pow wows between unrelated adults and juveniles have been seen in the fossil record before, points out Eva Hoffman, a vertebrate paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History who wasnt involved in the study. Even the wraparound tail doesnt guarantee anything Maybe the two were simply short on space. Until more examples of possible parent child associations emerge, Hoffman says, some caution may be warranted. But Drumheller Horton thinks a mom hunkering down with her kid is still the most probable explanation. The placement of the fossils was also unlikely to be a fluke. Bones this delicate dont just slosh into such intimate configurations. And if Dendromaia and Heleosaurus were both precocious parents, that tells us this behavior could have been present in a common ancestor of this group, Maddin says. Perhaps paleontologists have yet to uncover the lineages oldest doting moms and dads. Whatever their origins, parenting and its perks clearly stuck around. In many ways, its a sensible strategy, Mann says. By ferrying their kids through early life, ancient animals helped ensure their survival and the continued persistence of generations to come. Parental care is a strategy with a long antiquity, he says. Clearly, its worked out multiple times in evolutionary history. And we should have an appreciation for it."}, {"title": "Fossils From Some of the Last Homo Erectus Hint at the End of the Long-Lived Species", "author": "Brian Handwerk", "date": "December 18, 2019", "doc": "Homo erectus was a very successful early human, spreading across the ancient world and surviving Earths changing environments for nearly two million yearsat least five times longer than our own species has been around.

The fossils of H. erectus have been found in Western Asia Georgia, Eastern Asia China, and, thanks to a land bridge during a glaciated era of low sea levels, the islands of Indonesia, where the species persisted longest. The new dates from Ngandong, Java, place the species end days in context. When Homo erectus was living at Ngandong, Homo sapiens had already evolved in Africa, Neanderthals were evolving in Europe, and Homo heidelbergensis was evolving in Africa, said co author Russell Ciochon, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Iowa. Basically, Homo erectus sits back there as the ancestor of all these later hominins. In a new study in Nature, Ciochon and colleagues have written what, at least for now, appears to be the hominins final chapter. Of course it would be presumptuous for us to say weve dated the very last Homo erectus, he says. Weve dated the very last evidence that we have, the last appearance of Homo erectus. We dont know if on some neighboring island Homo erectus existed for a little longer after our date. The fossils in question have their own long and complex history. They were unearthed near the muddy banks of the Solo River in the early 1930s by a Dutch team that spotted an ancient rhino skull sticking out of the eroding sediments of a riverside terrace. The bones puzzled scientists over the succeeding years. Along with thousands of animal remains, a dozen human skull caps were found, but just two lower bones, which made experts wonder how the skulls came to be isolated without their attending skeletons. Because the bones were excavated nearly a century ago, it has been difficult to date them. The team tackled the problem by dating the wider geological context of the river system and the bone bed where the skulls were found, which sits some 20 meters above the current river thanks to thousands of years of erosion. Ciochon and colleagues began excavations in 2008, launching the comprehensive study more than a decade in the making. Weve dated everything that was there, the river terraces, the fossils themselves, the bone bed, and the stalagmites that formed in the karst caves, he says. The geological work suggests that the dozen Homo erectus individuals died upriver and were washed downstream by monsoon flooding, then were caught in debris jams where the ancient river narrowed at Ngandong. At that spot, they were further buried by channels of flowing mud. At least their skulls were. The research team also offers an explanation for why the rest of the Homo erectus skeletons went missing Where burials were in terraced deposits, once water eroded them out the skulls seemed to separate from the limb bones, Ciochon says. Limb bones are heavy and they dropped to the bottom of whatever water was moving them, but the skulls float. That may be why the skulls at Ngandong ended up separated from all but two of the long bones. Although most of the ancient skeletons were lost to the river, the skulls strange journey and fortunate discovery provided plenty of evidence for the team to examine. Theyve done some extensive excavations and geological studies, and theyve done a tremendous job integrating a variety of dating techniques to show very tight age constraints for that fossil bed and by inference the last appearance of Homo erectus, says Rick Potts, a paleoanthropologist and head of the Smithsonians Human Origins Program. We have evidence for terrace formation, we have evidence for these flood deposits and rapid deposition, all the fauna is coming from that bed, and so its most likely that Homo erectus did, too. Homo erectus survived so long in present day Indonesia that the species ended up sharing the planet with new groups of humans. Our own species is among these, but the new dates suggest that that we never lived side by side. Homo sapiens lived in Africa 117,000 years ago, but theres no evidence they reached Java before about 73,000 years agoat least 35,000 years after the last known Homo erectus died out. African H. erectus are thought to have vanished some 500,000 years ago. What finally finished Homo erectus off after nearly two million years of survival? Ciochon and colleagues theorize that climate change played a role. The bone bed at Ngandong was also filled with animal remains, especially deer and the large bovid ancestors of water buffalo and Javas banteng wild cattle. These large mammals thrived in open woodland ecosystems like the African homeland of Homo erectus. Ngandong was an open country habitat, with a little woodland, somewhat like the savannas of East Africa, Ciochon said. Then around 120,000 or 130,000 years ago, we know that there was a change in the climate, and this rainforest flora spread across Java. Homo erectus was not able to adapt. Other than Homo sapiens, no other early human was adapted to living in a rainforest. Though Homo erectus did finally fade away, it will always retain a prominent place on the family tree of human ancestors. Homo erectus is one of the iconic species in human evolutionary history, Potts says. Its perhaps the most important species that indicates how branchy the human family tree is, because Homo erectus persisted through all of those other species, including eventually Homo sapiens, coming into being from earlier populations of Homo erectus. Though this branch of our ancestral tree survives only in the distant past, the dates of Homo erectus last stand show the species enjoyed a longevity that only we might matchif we can survive another 1.5 million years."}, {"title": "Ancient Whale Fossil Helps Detail How the Mammals Took From Land to Sea", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "December 11, 2019", "doc": "Whales dont swim like fish do. Instead of moving their tales side to side like a shark or a sunfish, the marine mammals pump their tails up and down to propel themselves forward. But over 50 million years ago, the earliest whales had legs and could walk on land. Adapting to life in the sea required a new way of moving, and a fossil uncovered in Egypt helps estimate the time when whales became primarily tail powered swimmers. The partial skeleton, described today by University of Michigan paleontologist Iyad Zalmout and colleagues in PLOS ONE, is an ancient whale that swam the seas of whats now Egypt around 39 million years ago. The fossil was found in the desert of Wadi Al Hitan, a place so rich in cetacean fossils that its known as Whale Valley. In 2007 a joint expedition between paleontologists from the University of Michigan and the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency set out to find new whales and other vertebrates in a part of Wadi Al Hitan that had not been thoroughly explored before. One paleontologist spotted a cluster of vertebrae weathering out from the foothill of a prominent plateau known as Qaret Gehannam, Zalmout says, and even more fossilized bones appeared to be going into the rock. The experts had arrived at just the right time to catch the whale, recently exposed by the weathering of the foothill. All told, the paleontologists uncovered almost the entire spine, part of the skull, and pieces of the arms and legs. It was very clear from the shape and the size of the vertebrae and appendages that this whale is new in this area, Zalmout says. Further study indicated that the mammal was a species not seen anywhere else in the world. Named Aegicetus gehennae, the ancient swimmer stands out from others found in Wadi Al Hitan, which fall into one of two groups. Some earlier whales could swim with a combination of paddling limbs and undulating their spines, not unlike otters. Other whales, like Basilosaurus, lived in the sea full time and swam with tails only. Aegicetus fits between the two, representing a moment when whales were just switching to exclusively tail driven locomotion. Id say this fossil is another excellent piece of the puzzle of the lineage of whales that went from terrestrial to fully aquatic, says George Mason University paleontologist Mark Uhen. Like most animals, early whale evolution doesnt represent a straight line of progress, but instead is a branching bush of species that had various levels of aquatic skill. Many of these forms were amphibious, and, ultimately, went extinct. Another subset became more and more aquatic, sprouting its own branches that eventually spun off the first cetaceans to live in the seas for their entire lives. Aegicetus is part of the family that increasingly spent time in the water, related to todays leviathans. The key feature in this fossil, Zalmout and co authors point out, is the relationship between the hips and the spine. The earliest whales had hips attached to the spine, just like any terrestrial mammal. This configuration helped the hind limbs support the animals weight on land. But in Aegicetus and other whales that came later, the hips are decoupled from the spine and suspended by the flesh of the body. The tight fusion of vertebrae at the hip spine connectioncalled the sacrumalso became unfused and more flexible. These whales could no longer paddle with their legs and relied more on undulating their spines to move through the water. The shift indicates two things that these whales were spending most, if not all, of their time in the water where weight supporting legs werent needed, and that these beasts swam by principally using their tails. Not that Aegicetus was much like a modern orca or sperm whale. The fossil whale, which weighed almost a ton or about a sixth the weight of the biggest orcas, still had jaws set with different types of teeth instead of the simple cones of todays dolphins. Nor did Aegicetus swim just like its living relatives. Modern whales use their tails to swim and have evolved vertebral columns, as well as back and abdominal muscles, to power the tail, Uhen says. Aegicetus didnt have these anatomical features, and it lacks the skeletal specializations to support a broad tail fluke. Instead, the whale probably swam in a way that would look strange to us, undulating its midsection and long tail while steering with the forelimbs, a creature right at the crux of a stunning evolutionary transformation. Every time we find a complete and articulated whale of a new species there would be more thinking and digging than before, Zalmout says. While new discoveries have brought the early history of whales into greater focus than ever before, mysteries remain. For every question a fossil answers, more arise, which keeps our lives interesting Uhen says. Aegicetus is now a part of that story, leading paleontologists to wonder what else may rise from the depths of the fossil record."}, {"title": "Lice-Filled Dinosaur Feathers Found Trapped in 100-Million-Year-Old Amber", "author": "Brian Handwerk", "date": "December 10, 2019", "doc": "Anyone whos had to deal with a lice infestation knows how annoying the persistent little pests can be. But humans are far from the first animals to suffer at the expense of these hair  and feather inhabiting parasites. As far back as the Cretaceous period, insects that resemble modern lice lived and fed on the bodies of dinosaurs. Scientists examining amber fossils discovered 100 million year old insects preserved with the damaged dinosaur feathers on which they lived. The bugs provide paleontologists first glimpse of ancient lice like parasites that once thrived on larger animals feathers and possibly hair. The preservation in amber is extremely good, so good its almost like live insects, says Chungkun Shih, a paleoentomologist and co author of a study detailing the new find in Nature Communications. While dinosaurs may garner an outsized share of attention, the tiny prehistoric pests and parasites that lived on them are a particular specialty of Shih and colleagues at Capital Normal University CNU in Beijing. The scientists are fascinated by insects that spent their lives sucking the blood, or gnawing the skin, hair and feathers of their much larger hosts. Though small in scope, parasitic insects have caused enormous suffering by spreading modern diseases like the plague and typhus. In human history you can see that the flea caused the black plague, and even today we are affected by blood sucking or chewing parasites, Shih says. Studying the ancestors of living ectoparasites, which live on the outside of their hosts, can help scientists understand how these pests evolved over millions of years into the species that live among and on us today. Some finds have proven surprising. In 2012, CNU researchers reported a new family of huge, primitive fleasmore than two centimeters three fourths of an inch longthat survived for millions of years in northeastern China. The supersized fleas gorged on the blood of Jurassic period dinosaurs some 165 million years ago. While it stands to reason that feathered dinosaurs were plagued by lice like insects just as their living bird descendants are, the newly discovered insects encased in amber are the first example to emerge in the fossil record. The Cretaceous periods lice like insects are so small that they have not been found preserved in other fossils. The earliest bird louse previously known lived in Germany some 44 million years ago, and by that relatively late date the insect had become nearly modern in appearance. Consequently, early forms of lice and their evolutionary history have remained a mystery to scientists. Shih and colleagues found ten, tiny insect nymphs, each less than 0.2 millimeters long, distributed on a pair of feathers. Each feather was encased in amber some 100 million years ago in what is today the Kachin Province of northern Myanmar. During five years of studying amber samples these two were the only ones found to contain the lice like insects. Its almost like a lottery game, where you win once in a while. And we got lucky, Shih says. The bugs may not technically be lice, as their taxonomical relationship to the louse order Phthiraptera is unknown. But the insects in question, Mesophthirus engeli, appear as a primitive species very much resembling modern lice. The ancient bugs have different antennae and leg claws from a modern louse, but their wingless bodies look similar, and they feature the large chewing mandibles that cause so much irritation to their hosts. One feather shows signs of significant gnawing damage, suggesting that lice had established feather feeding lifestyles in the mid Cretaceous. The bugs may have evolved to exploit the expansion of feathered dinosaurs and early birds. Shih says that the team originally thought that the feathers in question belonged to early birds, but an expert on fossil feathers and co author on the study, Xing Xu, believes that they were actually from non avian dinosaurs. One of the two feathers with feeding damage is consistent with the feathers that have been found alongside a dinosaur tail fragment in Burmese amber, while the other feather seems more similar to those that have been found alongside primitive toothed birds in the deposit, Ryan McKellar, a curator of invertebrate paleontology at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum who specializes in dinosaur feathers, says in an email. The authors have made a really strong case for these insects being generalist feeders on feathers from a wide range of Cretaceous animals. It looks as though they have probably found the same group of insects feeding on feathers from both flying and flightless animals. Just how big of a scourge were lice during the days of the dinosaurs? With limited evidence, paleontologists cant say exactly how common the insects were, but Shih believes the rarity of his teams find is due to difficulties of preservation, not a scarcity of the prehistoric pests. Insects have their ways of populating themselves on a host, and at that time there was no insecticide to kill them, he says. Basically, they could grow and diversify and populate themselves, so I think that the numbers were probably fairly high. Perhaps future amber fossil finds will help illuminate how often dinosaurs suffered from lice. With any luck, future studies will be able to find these insects as adults, or on feathers that are still attached to an identifiable skeleton in amber, and narrow down the ecological relationships a little, McKellar says. In the meantime, it is a neat addition to the growing record of parasites like ticks and mites that have been associated with Cretaceous feathers. The find also illustrates just how resilient such parasites are, since the same type of insects have lived at the expense of larger animals for at least 100 million years, even as their hosts died out and were replaced by new animals for the bugs to feed on."}, {"title": "Video Game-Inspired Models Demonstrate How Prehistoric Squid Relatives Swam Through the Seas", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "November 26, 2019", "doc": "Ammonoids are one of the worlds greatest evolutionary success stories. From about 66 to 409 million years ago, thousands of species of these shelled cephalopods thrived in seas all over the planet. The marine creatures were so numerous and evolved at such a rapid pace that paleontologists often use ammonoids as index fossilsspecific species that mark particular swaths of prehistory, allowing scientists to date layers of rock by identifying the ammonoid fossils. But despite their past abundance, ammonoids and their behavior still remain something of a mystery to scientists. Much like their extant nautilus cousins, ammonoids were soft bodied cephalopods that lived inside coiled shells, which they grew throughout their lives. But squishy bodies often decay before fossilization, making the details of these creatures anatomy difficult to pin down. Learning simple behaviors of ammonoids, such as what a particular species ate, depends on delicate investigations of standout fossils, such as one ammonoid preserved with plankton in its mouth. Much of what experts have learned about ammonoids is thanks to their hard shells which survive more readily in the fossil record. Now, techniques borrowed from engineering, physics and even video games are helping experts envision and examine these extinct animals in ways never before possible. Paleontologists expect that all ammonoids squirted jets of water to propel themselves shell first through the seas. In the past, University of Utah paleontologist Kathleen Ritterbush says, researchers would place physical ammonoid models in water tanks to get an idea of how the invertebrates moved. But new technology, presented this week at an American Physical Society meeting, has allowed scientists to take their ammonoid swimming experiments a step further. The first step is making a digital recreation of the animals. We make replicas of real fossils by using a laser scanner to produce a 3 D model, Ritterbush says, which are then refined by PhD student Nick Hebdon. From there, the ammonoids are put through their paces. Our new results are all generated using computational fluid dynamics, Ritterbush says. The process is nothing like the typical paleontological business of dusty fieldwork. The simulations were designed by Hebdon using an engineering tool called ANSYS FLUENT, and the 3 D ammonoid models were placed within virtual liquid flows. The result is gorgeous simulations and visualizations of how water would flow around, past, and eddy out beyond the shell, Ritterbush says. Using such techniques, the researchers can investigate whether certain shell types are more susceptible to drag or if faster flowing water changes how a particular shell performs. This research on ammonoid swimming is cutting edge science, not just for ammonoids but for animals in general, says Royal Veterinary College biomechanics expert John Hutchinson. What makes ammonoids especially suited to this research, Hutchinson notes, is that the size and shapes of their shells were the main determinants of how these cephalopods performed while swimming. Ammonoid shells are not as biomechanically complex as dinosaur or mammoth skeletons, which involve more uncertainty when modelling what the animals could or could not do. The ammonoid modeling, on the other hand, can resolve a much clearer picture of how the invertebrates moved. Its the closest that the scientists can get to doing experiments on the live animals, Hutchinson says. But even the relatively simple structures of ammonoids dont fall into a one shell fits all model. Imagine the different physics of moving a shell the size of a garbanzo bean, or a golf ball, or a car tire, or a Fiat Ritterbush says. Shell size, current speed, how fast the shell was previously moving, and the ornamentation that makes ammonoids so recognizable all affect how they moved through the water. With new fluid dynamics tools, researchers can now study which shells were built for speed and which represent other modes of travel. We get surprises pretty much every time we run simulations and analyze the data, Ritterbush says. For example, the fluid dynamics change based on whether an ammonoid had the flanks of its shell covered by new growth or had the old parts of the shell coil exposed. To compare various ammonoid sizes, the researchers measured their speeds in terms of the diameters of their own shells traveled per second. At small sizes and modest speeds, say a pizza bagel jetting along at one diameter per second, it doesnt really matter if the coil is smoothed over or exposed, Ritterbush says. But among bigger ammonoid species, exposed central coils carry extra weight in the form of water trapped against the shell. The simulations can also reveal details of hypothetical ammonoids that never existed, or have yet to be found. Early in the project, Ritterbush hired video game designer Olivia Jenkins to make an easy to navigate user interface to play with different ammonoid shapes. Not only can this tool refine existing models, but it allows the researchers to test speculative ammonoids unlike any known species. What if this same shell was more inflated? What if it lacked ribs, or had big clunky knobs? Ritterbush wonders. By unlocking the dynamics of shell shapes, we can show people how vibrant and weird the seas were in dinosaur time. And by investigating how these biological whorls lived, perhaps experts can develop a better understanding of why ammonoids disappeared tens of millions of years ago."}, {"title": "How Scientists Resolved the Mystery of the Devil\u2019s Corkscrews", "author": "Hans-Dieter Sues", "date": "November 25, 2019", "doc": "One of the most unusual fossils ever to be found are strange tall structures recovered across Nebraska, primarily in the states northwestern badlands and in neighboring parts of Wyoming. Known locally as Devils Corkscrews, each structure is the infilling of a left  or right handed spiral or helix that can extend up to seven feet into the ground. At the deep end of the spiral, a tunnel extends sideways and up at an angle. These structures became exposed by weathering of the soft rock enclosing them on the sides of bluffs or ravines. They mainly occur in the fine grained sandstones of the Harrison Formation, which dates from the Miocene epoch and are about 20 to 23 million years old. It was paleontologist Erwin H. Barbour who first discovered them. Their forms are magnificent their symmetry perfect their organization beyond my comprehension, he wrote. Barbour assembled a marvelous fossil collection at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln in the late 19th century. Ably assisted by his wife Margaret and with financial support from one of the universitys trustees, he built a foundational collection of fossil mammals from Nebraska, dating mostly from the Neogene, about 23 to 2.58 million years ago. Today, the University of Nebraska State Museum of Natural History is famous for its fossil treasures, which document the diversity of mammals large and small living when the grasslands of the mid continent developed. Its most spectacular exhibition is a parade of the many extinct species of elephants that once roamed across what is today the midwestern United States.  While exploring the western part of Nebraska, Barbour collected dozens of examples of the giant spiral structures, reporting on them in 1892 and naming them Daimonelix Greek for devils screw, often spelled Daemonelix. Their origin was a mystery and there was nothing else like them in the fossil record. After first considering them as possible remains of giant freshwater sponges, Barbour surmised that the fossils of Daimonelix were the remains of plants, possibly root systems, because he had discovered plant tissues inside the helices. A year later, the legendary American vertebrate paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope rejected Barbours interpretation of the fossils, noting that the most probable explanation of these objects seems to be that they are the casts of the burrows of some large rodent. In the same year, the Austrian paleontologist Theodor Fuchs, an authority on trace fossils, independently arrived at the same conclusion. He noted thus we are justified in viewing these strange fossils as really nothing more than the underground homes of Miocene rodents, probably related to Geomys pocket gophers.  But Professor Barbour would have none of this and published a critique of Fuchss analysis in 1894. Assuming that the rocks of the Harrison Formation were lake deposits, Barbour commented that Dr. Fuchs gopher is left to burrow and build its nest of dry hay in one or two hundred fathoms of Miocene water. Fuchs had doubted that the surrounding rocks were lake deposits and interpreted the plant remains found by Barbour as hay stored by the burrow maker. Another American paleontologist, Olaf Peterson, collected specimens of the Devils Corkscrews for the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh. He observed that they often contained skeletons of an ancient beaver, Palaeocastor, which was slightly larger than todays black tailed prairie dog. And so, Peterson supported Copes reinterpretation. But Barbour vehemently defended his identification of the Devils Corkscrews as a kind of plant fossil. He responded to supporters of the rodent burrow hypothesis, If this is in truth the work of a gopher then it must stand as a lasting monument to the genius of that creature which laid the lines of his complex abode with such invariable precision and constancy.  Fuchs and others interpreted strange grooves on the infillings of the burrows as claw marks left by the digging animal. In time most researchers, including Barbours former student and successor at the State Museum, C. Bertrand Schultz, considered the structures fossil rodent burrows. For many years, no further research was undertaken on the identity of Daimonelix and the issue remained in a stalemate. Enter Larry Martin, an expert on fossil mammals at the University of Kansas. In the early 1970s, Martin and his student Deb Bennett studied many of the Devils Corkscrews in the field and in the lab. Their research on Daimonelix, published in 1977, painted a completely new picture of these strange spiral structures and their origin. By the time the Kansas researchers started their work, geologists had long rejected the lake deposit theory of the Harrison Formation and established that its fine grained sediments were instead accumulated by wind under seasonally dry conditions quite similar to the prevailing conditions in western Nebraska today. These deposits not only preserved the Devils Corkscrews, but also abundant fossil plant roots and burrows made by insects and small mammals. Martin and Bennett found that the incisor teeth of the extinct beaver Palaeocastor were a perfect match for the grooves on the infillings of the Devils Corkscrews. These tooth marks affirmed that they were, in fact, burrows, spiraling tunnels that the beaver Palaeocastor built mainly by excavating the soil with left  and right handed strokes of its large, flat incisors. The animal also left claw marks, but they tended to be confined to the sides and bottom of the burrows. The initial burrow extended down as a tightly coiled spiral. At the bottom, the beaver started digging upwards at an angle of up to 30 degrees to create a chamber for itself. This portion of the burrow sometimes extended up to 15 feet. The Daimonelix building Palaeocastor sported large, flat incisors. It lived and, based on finds of bones of young beavers, raised its litters at the end of this straight chamber. The tall, tightly coiled spiral entrance forming the top portion of the burrow is now thought to be an ingenious method for helping to retain moisture and control temperature in the animals burrow.  Scattered clusters of the burrows of Palaeocastor are often found in great numbers. These clusters probably resembled the towns of present day prairie dogs. Interestingly, other animals occasionally visited the burrowsincluding an extinct relative of martens and weasels, probably looking to make a meal of the burrows maker. But what of the plant tissues that Barbour had discovered inside the burrows? To solve that mystery, Martin and Bennett noted that the rocks containing the Daimonelix burrows were laid down in a seasonally dry environment. Under such conditions, plants would have difficulty finding enough moisture to survive. But inside the Daimonelix tunnels there was much more humidity and moisture seeking plants quickly grew their roots into the walls of the burrows. In fact, the growth was so abundant, the interior of the burrow walls would have to be cropped back by the beavers from time to time in order to maintain access. Since the rocks of the Harrison Formation contain a lot of ash from nearby volcanoes, rainwater flowing through the soil would become saturated with silica. Plant roots readily absorbed silica. Gradually, the root lined walls became mineralized and eventually the entire burrow was filled in with silicified roots. Mystery solved. What started out with the finding of curious fossils from the badlands of Nebraska led to a detailed reconstruction of an ancient ecosystem and the lives of some of its inhabitants. Every fossil carries this potentialto clue researchers into discoveries about the ancient environment and the plants and organisms that once thrived in it. As for Barbour, he apparently went to his grave denying that Daimonelix was a rodent burrow. The Daimonelix burrow with a skeleton of its maker, the extinct beaver called Palaeocaster is on view in the new fossil hall Deep Time at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C."}, {"title": "Newly Discovered Fossil Bird Fills in Gap Between Dinosaurs and Modern Fliers", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "November 14, 2019", "doc": "Birds are ancient creatures. Every hawk, sparrow, pigeon and penguin alive today has ancestral roots dating back to the Jurassic, when the first birds were just another form of raptor like dinosaur. Dozens of fossils uncovered and described during the last three decades have illuminated much of this deep history, but the rock record can still yield surprises. A fossil recently found in Japan is one such unexpected avian that raises questions about what else may await discovery. The skeleton, named Fukuipteryx prima, was described by Fukui Prefectural University paleontologist Takuya Imai and colleagues today in Communications Biology. And while numerous birds of similar geologic age have been named in the past few decades, the details of these bones and where they were found have experts a flutter. The 120 million year old fossil was discovered in the summer of 2013 while searching for fossils at Japans Kitadani Dinosaur Quarry. One of my colleagues at Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum spotted tiny bones in a block of siltstone, Imai says. At the time, it wasnt clear what creature the bones belonged to, but once the encasing rock was chipped away, the structure of the fossil became clear. The skeleton was an early bird, and an unusual one at that. Small bodies and hollow bones have made birds relatively rare finds in the fossil record. Only a few unique fossil deposits, like Chinas 125 million year old Jehol Biota or the United States 50 million year old Green River Formation, allow paleontologists to get a good look at ancient avians. To find a well preserved fossil bird outside such places of exceptional preservation represents a noteworthy paleontological discovery, and Fukuipteryx in Japan adds another significant spot on the map for fossil birds. More than that, the skeleton of Fukuipteryx is preserved in three dimensions, meaning the birds bones are close to their shape in life and have not been compressed over the course of time. To be honest, we were not expecting to find such good material from a fossil bird at our site, Imai says. The paleontologists had hoped for fragments and got most of a well preserved skeleton. The fossil differs from those found in Chinas Jehol Biota, which are smooshed and look like bony pancakes. Given that Fukuipteryx is roughly the same age as those flattened fliers, the skeleton offers experts a clear look at avian skeletal anatomy during the Early Cretaceous. In overall form, Imai and coauthors write, Fukuipteryx looks very similar to some of the earliest birds that evolved about 30 million years earlier during the Jurassic. Fingers ending in claws, for example, is a trait Fukuipteryx shares with one of the earliest known birds, Archaeopteryx. But the tail of Fukuipteryx is short and ends in a skeletal structure called a pygostyle. The bony structure is an anchor point for muscle and tail feathers, seen in modern birds and considered an important trait that birds evolved along their transition from raptor like dinosaurs to the fliers we know today. The combination of characteristics put Fukuipteryx in an unexpected place among early birds. Our analysis revealed it is the most primitive among the Early Cretaceous birds, Imai says. Fukuipteryx shared a great deal in common with the earliest birds while having the flashy tail associated with more modern species. Rather than being a strange case, Fukuipteryx underscores a common theme in evolution. As early parts of evolutionary diversification become better sampled, it doesnt surprise me when we see unexpected combinations of characteristics, says Stony Brook University paleontologist Alan Turner. Evolution rarely proceeds in a linear manner, Turner adds, with featureslike a pygostylesometimes showing up in combinations not seen before. Future discoveries will test the idea, but this one bird may indicate that the early proliferation of birds through the late part of the Jurassic and early part of the Cretaceous took on more varied forms than experts now recognize. I think as new localities are found with previously unsampled birds, we should expect surprises, Turner says, adding that experts have only just scratched the surface of ancient bird diversity. Fukuipteryx wont be the last fossil flapper to surprise scientists. I feel it is merely one of many currently unknown birds awaiting to be discovered in the future outside of China, Imai says. There is an entire world of early birds waiting in the wings."}, {"title": "New Ancient Ape Species Rewrites the Story of Bipedalism", "author": "Andrea Michelson", "date": "November 6, 2019", "doc": "The picture is on T shirts, coffee mugs and bumper stickers the ubiquitous but misinformed image of the evolution of humankind. A knuckle walking ape rouses himself to stand on two feet, and over a 25 million year March of Progress, he becomes a modern man. Most paleoanthropologists will tell you that this version of evolution is oversimplified, misleading or just plain wrong. The theory that the last common ancestor of humans and apes walked on its knuckles like a chimpanzee is not supported by the fossil record, although it has seen popularity in scientific discourse. David Begun, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Toronto, used to be an outspoken proponent of the knuckle walking hypothesis, until he was asked to consult on a newly discovered fossil that would challenge his assumptions about early hominid locomotion. When Madelaine B\u00f6hme, a researcher at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany, unearthed the partial skeleton of an ancient ape at the Hammerschmiede clay pit in Bavaria, she knew she was looking at something special. Compared to fragments, an intact partial skeleton can tell paleoanthropologists about a creatures body proportions and how its anatomy might have functioned. A relative newcomer to the field and a paleoclimatologist by trade, B\u00f6hme enlisted Beguns expertise in analyzing the fossil ape. B\u00f6hme and colleagues determined that the bones they found came from a dryopithecine ape, an extinct ancestor of humans and great apes that once lived in the Miocene epoch. The fossils are approximately 11.6 million years old and came from at least four individual apes, including one partial skeleton. The team described the newfound ancestor, named Danuvius guggenmosi, in a study published today in Nature. D. guggenmosi was likely a small primate about the size of baboon, with long arms like a bonobo. The creature had flexible elbows and strong hands capable of grasping, which suggests that it could have swung from tree to tree like a modern great ape. But the similarities with known apes stop there. The animals lower limbs have much more in common with human anatomy. With extended hips and knees, D. guggenmosi was capable of standing with a straighter posture than that of living African apes, and its knees and ankles were adapted to bear weight. The animals locomotion would have therefore shared similarities with both human and ape movement, and D. guggenmosi may have been able to navigate the forest by swinging from tree limbs and walking on two legs. There is no reason to think it would not have used all four limbs when that made sense, for example, on smaller branches where balance was an issue, Begun says. But it was also capable of both chimp like suspension and unassisted bipedalism. This hybrid form of locomotion, which B\u00f6hme and colleagues dubbed extended limb clambering, was previously unheard of. Begun says before this discovery, scientists in the field used models of motion employed by living quadruped primates to inform how our early ancestors may have moved. Here, we have something that doesnt exist today, he says. Its totally new and different, and you couldnt imagine it. It would have been silly to even suggest it unless you found fossils that told you that there was an animal like this. Unlike suspensory great apes that favor their forelimbs and bipedal hominins which prefer their hindlimbs, the anatomy of D. guggenmosi indicates that the ancient primate used both sets of limbs equally. The curvature of the big toe suggests that this animal would have been able to walk flat footed on branches, using its longest toe to grasp and balance. Our last common ancestor with great apes doesnt look like a chimp or any living great apehe may have looked like Danuvius, B\u00f6hme says. D. guggenmosi puts bipedality on the evolutionary timeline far earlier than scientists previously expected. Jeremy DeSilva, a paleoanthropologist who reviewed the study for Nature, says while this discovery sheds some light on how hominids began to walk on two feet, it also raises new questions about the evolution of locomotion. Rather than humans evolving to become bipedal after splitting from a quadruped ancestor, the great apes must have evolved from a creature with bipedal capabilities. Given what we know about the relationships between humans and the African great apes, then gorillas and chimpanzees would have had to have independently evolved knuckle walking. That would have happened twice, DeSilva says. That is unsettling. Its disruptive to what we once thought. B\u00f6hme says it is also worth noting that D. guggenmosi was found in Europe, far from where most people imagine ancient apes lived. The narrative of human evolution is typically set on the African stage, but before early humans evolved, some of their primate relatives were living in forests that stretched across the Mediterranean. We have to keep in mind that a big part of human history or human early evolution was not an African story, B\u00f6hme says. Another mysterious part of the puzzle, DeSilva says, is that the European apes completely disappear a few million years after D. guggenmosi. And another couple million years after that, scientists start to see evidence of early human development in Africa. But theres a huge gap in the fossil record between D. guggenmosi and the next partial skeleton in the human family, Ardipithecus ramidus. Weve got these bookends with Danuvius and Ardipithecus, and then the in betweens are now giant question marks, DeSilva says. To a scientist, thats not discouraging. Its exciting."}, {"title": "Eagle Talon Jewelry Suggests Neanderthals Were Capable of Human-Like Thought", "author": "Megan Gannon", "date": "November 1, 2019", "doc": "With cut after cut of a stone knife, a Neanderthal painstakingly sliced a sharp talon from the toe bone of an eagle, perhaps crafting a necklace or some other personal ornament. They then tossed aside the bone on a cave floor along with other scraps and broken tools. More than 39,000 years later, archaeologists found the cut marked toe bone in what is now Spain. An analysis of the eagle remains, published today in the journal Science Advances, adds a new piece of evidence to our understanding of the behavior of Neanderthals. The find reignites a debate among scientists Did our extinct cousins engage in symbolic activities, like making art and decorating their bodies, that weve long believed were uniquely human? The toe bone was unearthed in a narrow cave in Calafell, a village on the Mediterranean coast southwest of Barcelona. Named Cova Foradada, the caves archaeological significance was discovered by chance in 1997 when hikers found several human bones from the Neolithic period, a time when humans in Europe first started settling in villages and relying on agriculture for sustenance. Years of subsequent excavations have revealed that Cova Foradadas history extends far beyond the Neolithic. Humans were using the site 38,000 years ago for hunting related activities. Before that, some of the last Neanderthals in Europe sought shelter there, too. No Neanderthal bones have been found at Cova Foradada, but the ancient relative of our own species did leave behind telltale tools associated with the Ch\u00e2telperronian culture. Ch\u00e2telperronian artifacts, including stone tools and tiny beads, have been linked with Neanderthals in southwestern France and northern Spain. Around 44,000 years ago, this culture coincided with the time period that Neanderthals were in contact with modern humans in Europe before disappearing about 30,000 years ago. Among the layers of Ch\u00e2telperronian artifacts at Cova Foradada, archaeologists found a toe bone from an imperial eagle with clear cut marks. In the last decade, archaeologists across southern Europe have started recognizing similar cut marked raptor bones and talons at Neanderthal sites, such as the 44,000 year old Fumane cave in Italy and the 130,000 year old Krapina site in Croatia. Analyses of these artifacts and experiments with raptor carcasses have suggested that the claws at these sites were deliberately removed and worn as personal ornaments. At first these talons seemed like isolated examples. Now theyve been documented at about a dozen Neanderthal sites, including Cova Foradada. I think it is an important addition to growing body of evidence of personal ornament usage in Neanderthals, now spanning more than 80,000 years, says Davorka Radov\u010di\u0107, a curator at the Croatian Natural History Museum, Zagreb, who studied the talons at Krapina but was not involved in the new study. Neanderthals lived from Portugal to Eurasia, but their penchant for using raptor claws seems restricted to a specific region of southern Europe, from northern Spain through southern France and northern Italy to Croatia, says the lead author of the new study, Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Hidalgo, a researcher at the Institute of Evolution in Africa IDEA, which is based in Madrid. Did wearing talon jewelry have special meaning for Neanderthals living in this geographic area? We think that the talons are related to the symbolic world of the Neanderthals, Rodr\u00edguez says. While its difficult or even impossible to know what these symbols actually meant to Neanderthals, their use may imply that Neanderthals were practicing a form of communication. Were looking at evidence of traditions that have to do with social identification, says John Hawks, an anthropologist at the University of WisconsinMadison who wasnt involved in the study. Why do you wear ornaments? Why do you go through this trouble? Because you notice something interesting, you want to associate yourself with it, and you want it to mark yourself for other people to recognize. The question about wearing talons gets to the heart of a larger debate among paleoanthropologists about Neanderthals. Thirty years ago, scientists only ascribed symbolic behavior to Homo sapiens, and Neanderthals were thought to be totally different from us, Rodr\u00edguez says. Now we have little pieces of evidence that show a different picture. Those little pieces of evidence include Neanderthal use of pigments, ritualistic burial sites and possible cave art. Still, many of these findings remain extremely controversial. Just last month, the Journal of Human Evolution published a paper signed by more than 40 anthropologists arguing that there is no strong evidence for Neanderthal cave art in Spain. The researchers were responding to findings, reported last year, that suggested a few cave art sites in Spain were at least 65,000 years old, predating the arrival of modern humans in regionmeaning they must have been created by Neanderthals. The authors of the response paper contend that we have no reason to believe that Neanderthals made cave art because evidence of their symbolic practices are exceedingly rare and often ambiguous, paling in comparison to the complex figurative cave art created by modern humans. Neanderthals are also known to have made birch tar as an adhesive, suggesting they were capable of human like planning and complex cognition. But a few months ago, another research team published a study claiming that birch tar wasnt actually so hard to make and shouldnt be used as an example of Neanderthals cleverness. These cases illustrate how little consensus there is about how to interpret the archaeological evidence at possible Neanderthal sites, Hawks says. The views that people have are so far apart that it goes all the way from, Neanderthals are meat robots that had nothing interesting going on in their head on one extreme, to Neanderthals are fully modern and basically like us and we cant discriminate against them, on the other end. While Rodr\u00edguezs new study offers a picture of necklace wearing Neanderthals, he thinks the current body of evidence regarding Neanderthal behavior suggests significant differences between Homo neanderthalensis and the Homo sapiens that displaced them. If Neanderthals had a very, very complex world like us, in the record this evidence should be very common, Rodr\u00edguez says. With the evidence still fragmentary, he doesnt think scientists can insist yet that Neanderthals were just like modern humans, but perhaps they were more like us than previously believed."}, {"title": "Six Bewitching Smithsonian Specimens to Get You Ready for Halloween", "author": "Erin I. Garcia de Jesus", "date": "October 29th, 2019, 1:09PM", "doc": "Smithsonian Voices  National Museum of Natural History \n\n Its that time of the year. Jack o lanterns sit on porches everywhere, bats fly through the night and kids demand candy. People across the U.S. are clamoring for costumes and immersing themselves in all things spine chilling. At the National Museum of Natural History there are plenty of shocking read fascinating specimens behind the scenes ready for Halloween. Here are some of the spookiest read coolest items tucked away in the museums collections. An insect eating plant dressed up as a cobra Kids arent the only ones putting on creepy costumes for the holiday. The carnivorous cobra lily is also ready to trick or treat. Though this plant wears its ensemble year round, not just on October 31st. The cobra lily Darlingtonia californica gets its name from the cobra like appearance of its tubular leaves  replete with leaves that mimic a snakes forked tongue or fangs. Rather than gulping down eggs as real cobras do or pulling nutrients from the soil like most plants, the cobra lily gets some of its nourishment by laying a trap for hungry insects. Each cobra shaped leaf has a hood that covers its opening, where nectar glands serve to lure unsuspecting insects attracted to the plants color and scent. Once an insect has taken the bait, short, stiff, backward pointing hairs keep them trapped inside the pitcher. There they are confused by bright windows at the top of the plant    which they mistake for exits    before tiring and falling into the trap to dissolve into plant chow. An accidental skeleton Is it even Halloween without a cemetery? Especially one that turns up an unexpected skeleton. In 1977, a group of workers uncovered a skeleton during a routine grave excavation at the Custer National Cemetery in Montana. But the bones didnt belong to humans  they were fossilized remains of an ancient marine reptile. The partial skeleton belonged to Dolichorhynchops osborni  a species of short necked plesiosaur that lived between 220 and 60 million years ago. Six days of digging yielded the reptiles entire pelvis, pectoral girdle and a near complete vertebral column. Dolichorhynchops osborni was on display in the Smithsonians Life in the Ancient Seas exhibit from 1990 to 2013. Today, it is kept in collections at the National Museum of Natural History, where it is still mounted and provides convenient Halloween d\u00e9cor.   A mind controlling parasite Searching for a real life zombie? Look no further than a parasite controlled snail with translucent and colorful eye stalks that mimic caterpillars. Leucochloridium paradoxum is a parasitic worm that amber snails ingest from bird poop. Once consumed, the parasite then proceeds to take control. Larva invade the snails eyes and transform them from slender stalks to throbbing caterpillar like masses that will catch a birds attention for a meal. If eaten, the parasites develop into adults in the birds gut. There, they lay eggs that are released in the birds droppings.    But before it makes it into the birds stomach, Leucochloridium employs its powers of mind control to ensure that the snail does what the parasite needs it to. Infected snails ditch their nocturnal ways and venture into broad daylight on the highest parts of plants  where they present an easy target for hungry birds.     Glowing squirrel bones While skulking around on Halloween night, keep an eye out for luminous jack o lanterns, glowing ghosts andfluorescent squirrel bones? Nearly all fox squirrels Sciurus niger have a genetic condition called congenital erythropoietic porphyria CEP. Squirrels with CEP have a mutation in a bit of their DNA that is important for making a key part of red blood cells. They make too much of a compound called uroporphyrin, which builds up in their bones, teeth and urine. Uroporphyrin happens to fluoresce pink when exposed to UV light. So, under a blacklight, fox squirrel bones glow  unlike those from their close relative the eastern gray squirrel S. carolinensis. Other animals  including humans  get CEP too, which can cause skin blisters and sensitivity to light. Fox squirrels are spared from these unpleasant symptoms and dont show signs of illness, though researchers arent sure why.  Peer into a crystal ball Though some crystal balls are apt for fortune telling, the Smithsonians orb is good for turning the room upside down. The museums sphere is the worlds largest flawless quartz ball  weighing in at 242,323 carats, or 106 pounds. No one knows where the quartz came from, though it was cut and polished in China in the 1920s. Myanmar formerly known as Burma and Madagascar are the best guesses, since these regions supplied the clearest quartz at that time. The sphere arrived at the Smithsonian shortly after it was made and has been on display ever since. Why does this marvel of the Earth flip objects upside down? Its an optical effect due to the balls spherical shape, which makes it act as a lens. This crystal ball may not tell fortunes, but it certainly enchants visitors. Insects that recycle corpses Haunted houses bursting with corpses have nothing on the predatory bagworm Perisceptis carnivora. Bagworm larvae are known for their cocoons made from sticky silk and bits of plants fashioned into a bag where they transform into fuzzy moths. Perisceptis carnivora, however, has a different medium to attach to the silk bodies of its prey. These predatory caterpillars feast on ants, spiders, flies and a wide range of other insects. The larvae affix one end to a surface, such as a leaf, and deploy their free end to attack prey. After their meal, they stick what remains of their victims to a larval bag. If thats not disturbing enough, P. carnivora has an enemy of its own. Smithsonian scientists have reported parasitoid wasps  which lay their eggs in the bodies of other insects  emerging from these corpse covered bags.

The ranks of the dead arent filled with people, but animals that lived 66 million years ago. Preserved in hardened concretions of stone lie the remains of turtles, crocodiles, and most of all, mammals that lived in this place during the first million years after the terrible impact that triggered the extinction of the dinosaurs. These animals form a part of our own evolutionary narrativethe story of how mammals went from scurrying around the feet of larger creatures to dominating the continents of the world, evolving into a variety of unique beings, including ourselves. Mammals are not recent additions to the world that came after the time of the dinosaurs. The oldest mammals go back much further in time, and contrary to the standard story of shrew like critters kept in check by monstrous reptiles, mammals thrived during Mesozoic era. The asteroid impact that felled the terrible lizards was also a portentous event for the mammals that had already been plying their own success for tens of millions of years. The mammalian story is a complicated one. Paleontologists still dont entirely agree about the identity of the very first mammals. Modern mammals are easy to spotthey have mammary glands and produce milk, among other traits like delicate inner ear bones and fur. These characteristics are what gives our family the name mammal. But further back into the fossil record, the only way to identify a mammal is from bones, teeth and shared anatomical features. Depending on who you ask, mammals can be regarded as a broad group called mammaliformes that appeared by the Late Triassicwhen dinosaurs were just beginning to diversify themselvesaround 220 million years ago. But mammaliaformes is a broad group that includes lineages that are totally extinct today. The last common ancestor of all modern mammals lived sometime during the Jurassic, over 160 million years ago. Regardless of what was the earliest mammalian beast, though, animals very closely related to mammals have been around for nearly as long as the dinosaurs, and they underwent an evolutionary explosion during the Mesozoic. Often people are surprised to hear that mammals were around at all in the Mesozoic, a time usually associated with dinosaurs and other reptiles, says University of Oxford paleontologist Gemma Louise Benevento. And even when mammals are included in studies of the Mesozoic, they are often characterized as small, shrew like insectivores like the 205 million year old Morganucodon from Wales and China. This picture, Benevento says, primarily comes from 100 year old research carried out on North American fossil mammals, where the record of tiny teeth and bones ostensibly shows mammals scurrying in the shadows of caves until after the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period. But recent discoveries around the world have changed the story, revealing that mammals were thriving alongside the dinosaurs. Mesozoic beasts came in many forms. Castorocauda was the Jurassic equivalent of a beaver, complete with a scaly, flattened tail. Volaticotherium, from about the same time, resembled a flying squirrel. Fruitafossor, by contrast, was like a Jurassic aardvark, with powerful limbs that appear well suited to tearing open termite nests. And the badger sized Repenomamus was an omnivore that, thanks to fossil stomach contents, we know ate baby dinosaurs. Every year a few more mammal ancestors are added to the list. Then, one day 66 million years ago, a catastrophic asteroid impact triggered a devastating mass extinction that killed off nearly all dinosaursleaving only birdsand reshuffled the evolutionary deck for mammals. The event is often interpreted as a stroke of cosmic luck that allowed mammals to step out of the shadow of the reptiles and expand in size, shape, behavior and habitat. But as paleontologists continue to dig into the critical time after the impact, the story is becoming more complex. The rise of the mammals was not necessarily assured, and recovery from the disaster took far longer than expected. The fossils of Corral Bluffs are part of that story. Described by Denver Museum of Nature and Science paleontologist Tyler Lyson and colleagues, the stacks of fossils and rock in this pocket of Colorado document approximately the first million years of the Paleocene, the time period directly following the Cretaceous after the mass extinction. Correlating the mammal fossils to others from the site and a carefully calibrated timescale, the research team was able to come up with a rough timeline of how mammalian beasts transformed in a world where the likes of Tyrannosaurus no longer roamed. Mammals did not emerge from the extinction event unscathed. Before the asteroid strike, Lyson says, the largest mammals were about the size of a raccoon. Immediately after, the biggest mammals were about rat sized. But in a world without towering dinosaurs, new opportunities opened for mammals. Within 100,000 years after the extinction, we have a different type of raccoon size mammals, Lyson says, with additional fossils from Corral Bluffs revealing an increase size over time. By the 300,000 year mark, the biggest mammals were about the size of large beavers, and those that lived 700,000 years after the impact could weigh over a hundred pounds, such as Ectoconus ditrigonus, a herbivore unlike any mammal alive today. This is a hundred fold increase in body size compared to the mammals that survived the extinction, Lyson says. Mammals wouldnt go through this sort of rapid growth again for another 30 million years. The question facing paleontologists is what spurred this rapid growth. A combination of factors were likely at play. Not only did the dinosaurs that munched mammals disappear, but a warming global climate changed the makeup of forests and allowed for the evolution of new plants. Legumesenergy rich plants and the ancestors of beanevolved for the first time. The botanical changes may have helped provide the fuel for mammalian growth, Lyson says, with climate, plants and mammals all tied together in a story of recovery from one of the worlds most devastating mass extinctions. For the first time, we are able to link changes in plants and animals together, and more importantly, we are able to place all of these changes in a high resolution temporal framework, Lyson says. Despite the relief of living in a world without rapacious dinosaurs, mammals took time to expand into the wildly varied family of beasts that diversified throughout the Cenozoic, from herbivorous thunder beasts to saber toothed cats to walking whales. Earlier this year, Benevento and colleagues published a study looking at mammal jaws from the Mesozoic and into the following Cenozoic era. The researchers were interested in the different shapes that mammal jaws took as related to diet. What they found was that mammal jaw disparityand therefore the variety of herbivores, carnivores, omnivores and insectivoresrose sharply during the Mesozoic, before the impact. But the extinction changed mammalian luck. Even though the variety of jaw shapes stayed the same through the extinction event, Benevento says, different mammals rose while the old varieties died off. The extinction was terrible for the more archaic mammals but a boon to our distant relatives and ancestors, allowing more modern mammals to take up the ecological roles previously filled by other species. Between the Cretaceous and Paleocene, we have an extinction and turnover of mammals with one group decreasing and the other increasing, Benevento says. The rise of mammals took time. It wasnt until the Eocene, more than 10 million years after the impact, that mammals became truly large and evolved into an array of beasts to rival the dinosaurs. There are no known mammals filling the large grazer niche in the Mesozoic, Benevento says, and it took about 10 million years for herbivorous mammals to grow big enough resemble todays bison and antelope. Its easy to take the evolutionary success of mammals as a foregone conclusion, especially given that were a part of the family, but new fossils are only just now revealing the deep and tangled roots of our own evolutionary tree."}, {"title": "Newly Discovered Dinosaur Was a Giant \u2018Shark Tooth\u2019 Carnivore", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "October 9, 2019", "doc": "Tyrannosaurs are often seen as the kings of the prehistoric world. Theyre among the largest and most charismatic of giant predators to stalk the Earth during the age of dinosaurs. But they werent the only voracious giants of the time. The shark tooth lizards, known to paleontologists as carcharodontosaurs, ruled all over the planet for tens of millions of years before and during the rise of tyrannosaurs, and a new find in southeast Asia helps fill in the backstory of these impressive carnivores. A new species named Siamraptor suwati was found in the Early Cretaceous rock outcrops of Thailand. Dinosaurs can be difficult to find among the Mesozoic rocks of southeast Asia. Rock layers of the right age and type to find dinosaur bones are less abundant in this part of the world than places like the western United States or China, and those that do exist are often covered by thick forest. Yet, as reported today by Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University paleontologist Duangsuda Chokchaloemwong and colleagues in the journal PLOS ONE, the bones of Siamraptor were found in 115 million year old rocks near the Thai district of Ban Saphan. The fossils were uncovered between 2008 and 2013 as part of a joint project with the Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum in Japan. From the first material we found, we knew right away this is an important specimen, Chokchaloemwong says. All told, the bones of Siamraptor include parts of the spine, hips, feet, hands and skull. The dinosaur was an impressive hunter. At the place where Siamraptor was found, there are many carcharodontosaur teeth that match those of the newly named predator. Given that dinosaurs shed teeth throughout their lives, including when they ate, the Ban Saphan Hin site appears to have been a Siamraptor stomping ground. Siamraptor now joins a bizarre and impressive array of carcharodontosaurs. Some members of this family bore strange ornaments on their backs, like the high spined Acrocanthosaurus from the southern United States. Others, like Giganotosaurus from Argentina, grew to enormous sizes that matched or exceeded the great Tyrannosaurus rex. Carnivores like Siamraptor were apex predators in many of the places where tyrannosaurs failed to gain a claw hold, and their anatomy underscores differences in how these dinosaurs behaved. At rough glance carcharodontosaurs and tyrannosaurs are broadly similar, says University of Maryland paleontologist Thomas Holtz, Jr., as both are marked by big heads, big bodies and short arms. But digging into the details, the predators are very different. While the snouts of T. rex and kin are broad and round, Holtz says, carcharodontosaurs have hatchet heads with tall and narrow snouts fitted with blade like teeth. The different snouts affect how these animals would have hunted and fed. The bite in tyrannosaurids was bone crushing like a hyena or an alligator, while that in carcharodontosaurs were more shark like and slicing, Holtz says. While a dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus had a bite suited to crushing bone and wrenching muscle from the skeleton, dinosaurs like Siamraptor could open their mouths wide to slice large chunks of flesh while generally avoiding bone. Carcharodontosaurs feeding habits were almost like those of modern big cats, stripping flesh but largely leaving bones alone. But what makes Siamraptor particularly significant is what the find means for future discoveries. Even though paleontologists had found carcharodontosaurs from the Early Cretaceous of North America, Europe and Africa, no one had found any fossils of the giant predators from the same time period in Asia. Siamraptor is the first and oldest definitive dinosaur of its family in southeast Asia, indicating that these imposing cousins of Allosaurus had spread to several ancient continents during the Early Cretaceous. The worldwide map of carcharodontosaurs had broad coverage during this time, Holtz says, but the discovery of Siamraptor adds one more dot where the family had not been found before. And theres still more to discover. The frontiers of dinosaur discovery stretch everywhere. From Thailand to Chile to Washington state, Holtz says, we are getting an ever growing picture of the diversity in the world of dinosaurs."}, {"title": "This Ancient Shark Looked Like an Eel and Swallowed Its Prey Whole", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "October 3, 2019", "doc": "Almost everything paleontologists know about ancient sharks comes from their teeth. Thats because the animals had skeletons made of cartilage, which does not fossilize as easily as bone. So researchers were surprised to find several shark skulls and an almost complete skeleton of 360 million year old primitive shark in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. The fossils, described in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, come from two species of sharks in the genus Phoebodus, which went extinct during the Caroboniferous Period about 299 to 359 million years ago, leaving behind no known ancestral species. Bob Yirka at Phys.org reports that prior to the discovery, Phoebodus sharks were only known from three teeth. These fossils survived because the area where the animals died was a shallow sea basin. Their bodies were covered in sediment and limited water circulation and low oxygen levels allowed them to fossilize without being destroyed by predators or broken down by bacteria. Still, the fossils were fragile, so the team chose to examine them using a CT scan instead of chipping them out of the rock. The imaging reveals a very strange, un shark like creature. Yirka reports Phoebodus had a long, thin body along with a flat skull and jaw. The creature looks much more like a giant eel than a typical modern shark. But it does resemble an atypical modern sharkthe elusive frilled shark. That species is found in deep water around the world, but is little studied. Until 2004 when the creature was first video recorded, it was only known from being pulled up in fishing nets. Tim Vernimen at National Geographic reports that the three cusped teeth of the ancient species and the frilled shark are similar and can offer clues to how the ancient species hunted. The frilled shark is a specialized predator, with the ability to suddenly burst forward to catch its prey, David Ebert at the Pacific Shark Research Center, who has studied frilled sharks, but was not involved in the new study, says. The inward pointing teeth then help to make sure the prey can only go one way into its throat. Maybe Phoebodus did something similar. While most modern sharks use their teeth to rip prey to pieces before gobbling them up, the frilled sharkand perhaps Phoebodususe their unique teeth to capture prey and swallow them whole, study coauthor Christian Klug of the University of Zurich tells Vernimen . Because data on frilled sharks is almost as elusive as fossils of Phoebodus, the team also examined the jaws and teeth of the alligator gar, a species of North American fish dating back 100 million years that has a surprisingly similar mouth to the ancient shark. The gar hunts in open water, and its long jaw and flat head allows it to snap at a fishing coming from almost any direction. Its possible that Phoebodus developed its unique shape hundreds of millions of years earlier to hunt in the same manner. When a certain structure or strategy is effective, there is a tendency for it to show up time and time againboth in living creatures and in the fossil record, Justin Lemberg, gar researcher at the University of Chicago who was not involved in the study, tells Vernimmen. While a lot has changed since Phoebodus swam the Devonian oceans, the physics of feeding in water have not. This isnt the only rare shark fossil rewriting what we know about ancient sharks. Last month, researchers from the University of Chicago made a CT scan of a 2 foot long, 335 million year old shark found in Scotland in 1837. They found that the early shark was a suction feeder, using mouth parts in a manner similar to modern day nurse sharks and carp. Modern imaging techniques are showing researchers that ancient sharks had diverse feeding patterns, similar to modern sharks.  The quantity of data that is emerging from studies such as this is staggering, paleontologist John Maisey of the American Museum of Natural History, not involved in the study, tells Vernimmen. We are experiencing a renaissance of anatomy."}, {"title": "Bronze Age Baby Bottles Reveal How Some Ancient Infants Were Fed", "author": "Brian Handwerk", "date": "September 25, 2019", "doc": "Every parent knows how critical it is to have a sippy cup on hand, and three drinking vessels from a pair of ancient German graves reveal that such cups were just as important 3,000 years ago as they are today. Across the European continent, archaeologists have dug up curious pint sized pottery from sites dating back to the Neolithic Period, including small cups and bowls with drinking spouts. Left to ponder their purpose, some researchers have suggested the vessels were feeding cups for the old or infirm. Others theorized that they were used to feed ancient infants, even though our ancestors young relied on breastmilk. A new study examined several Bronze and Iron Age cups unearthed from childrens graves in the 1990s to confirm the latter theory. By analyzing ancient residues left in the vessels, scientists believe that the cups dispensed animal milk used for what perhaps could be best described as feeding time in the prehistoric nursery. It was looking at the context of graves that really confirmed that they were infant feeding vessels, says Julie Dunne, of the University of Bristol, co author of the study published in Nature. This is really the first direct evidence of what infants are not necessarily just weaned on, but Id say fed as well. Its quite likely that they were supplemented with this animal milk. Similar vessels shaped like animals found in the region suggest a second purpose. The fact they made some of them to look like animals is to make their children smile, isnt it? Dunne says. Rebecca Gowland, a Durham University bioarchaeologist not involved with the research, says the fact that an infant under six months old was being fed animal milk, and later died, poses interesting questions. Had the infants mother died and was that why heshe wasnt being breastfed? Gowland asks via e mail. Or was there another reason for not breastfeeding the infant? For those over six months, you would expect some form of supplementary food as the article suggests, but its fascinating that the babies were buried with their drinking vessels. Fatty residues found in pots from across the northern Mediterranean suggest humans began consuming milk and dairy products from domesticated animals during the Neolithic revolution, at least 9,000 years ago. Soon after hunter gatherers started to produce their own food through agriculture and domestication and settle in larger communities, they began using animal milk. A study of milk proteins found in ancient plaque, released earlier this month, provided direct evidence that Neolithic adults consumed cattle, goat andor sheep milk in Europe beginning at least 6,000 years ago. Genetic studies suggest Neolithic adults had lactose intolerance, so instead of drinking milk people may have processed it into digestion friendly cheese or fermented it into yogurt. Among the many changes during the Neolithic revolution was a prehistoric baby boom that led to overall population growth, evidenced by a marked increase in the proportions of infant and juvenile remains found in excavations of the time period. New feeding habits for children may have helped spark this population spike. To explore how ancient infants ate, studies have delved into ancient breastfeeding and weaning practices by analyzing bones and teethresearch thats now supplemented by the direct evidence of milk in infant feeding vessels. The cups Dunne and colleagues analyzed were found at a pair of sites in Bavaria, dating to 1200 to 800 and 800 to 450 B.C, but similar types of prehistoric sippy cups have been found at European sites dating back to 5500 to 4800 B.C. Could Neolithic European children also have drank animal milk from them as their Bronze Age counterparts did thousands of years later? In a later period, we now have positive evidence that these might be baby or toddler feeding vessels. So the next step is to go to examine the same types of vessels in earlier periods, says Eva Rosenstock, an archaeologist at the Free University of Berlin unaffiliated with the research. Theres a really broad story here in feeding infants these sorts of foods, Dunne says. Hunter gatherer mothers would have fed infants quite a different diet. They didnt have milk from domesticated animals or cereals available to them. Hunter gatherers also tended to breastfeed for several years and give birth less frequently. But once people settled down with domesticated animals, plants and supplementary food products, researchers theorize that the interval between births shortened dramatically and sparked a population explosion. Feeding children animal milk could have even been a motor of population increase by enabling shorter lactation periods for mothers, says Rosenstock. Once you had milk, you could feed your babies supplementary foods earlier, and maybe by doing so reduce your birth spacing and have more offspring. Like a spilled milk smell that can never quite be removed from a car, residues from these ancient milks, while imperceptible to the human eye, remained in the cups for thousands of years, which Dunne calls very, very fortuitous. The reasons why can be seen at the microscopic level. These pots are unglazed. If you were to put milk in the pot, the fat is absorbed into the very small pores and sits there very happily for thousands of years, Dunne says. These lipids are the perfect size to fit within the vesicles of that ceramic fabric. It is quite fantastic that they do survive. The scientists put the ancient fatty acids though molecular and chemical isotope analysis and compared their signatures with those of known milks and animal fats. Though the analysis match couldnt tell exactly which type of ruminant milk once filled these tiny childrens cups, cattle, sheep and goat bones are found at settlement sites across prehistory. Other farm produced foods were also available. If it is possible to recover preserved proteins from the ancient vessels, Rosenstock says that a more complete picture would emerge of what the children ateincluding whether cereals might have been mixed with the milk. Milk plus cereal is such a good combination, she says. Those mixtures have a very nice amino acid spectrum thats very wholesome, and theyre a good supplemental or weaning food. The fact that milk residues can be detected at all in these cups after thousands of years, however, highlights a significant problem that Neolithic parents would have encountered It would have been very hard for them to keep the cups clean. It is unlikely that these vessels were sterilized, so their use would not have been optimal for very young infants, as they were potentially a source of pathogens, Gowland says. Exposure to diseases like gastroenteritis was a significant threat, and a diet of animal milk also fails to provide human babies with all the benefits of breastfeeding. Human breastmilk packs all the nutrients infants need, contains immune cells that protect the human body from infection, and builds the diverse gut microbiome thats essential for good health. The fates of the cups owners suggests that they werent in good health. But at this point, it is unclear if the practice of consuming animal milk, or perhaps not having access to breast milk, had anything to do with their early deaths. Sometimes in archaeology you do get this immediacy, and a connection, with the artifacts and therefore the people, Dunne says. And holding these you really can think of these mothers and their little babies, and how they buried them in these little graves and put their own little feeding vessels in with them. I think thats telling us an awful lot about the love and the care that prehistoric moms would have spent on their babies."}, {"title": "1.7-Million-Year-Old Rhino Tooth Provides Oldest Genetic Information Ever Studied", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "September 12, 2019", "doc": "DNA sequencing has revolutionized the way researchers study evolution and animal taxonomy. But DNA has its limitsits a fragile molecule that degrades over time. So far, the oldest DNA sequenced came from a 700,000 year old horse frozen in permafrost. But a new technique based on the emerging field of proteomics has begun to unlock the deep past, and recently researchers deciphered genetic information from the tooth enamel of a rhinoceros that lived 1.7 million years ago. In traditional DNA sequencing, the molecule is run through a machine that amplifies the genetic material and is able to read off the sequence of nucleotidesadenine A, cytosine C, guanine G and thymine Tthat make up the DNA strand and encode instructions to make amino acids and proteins. The quality and completeness of a genome depends on how well the DNA is preserved. The new proteomics approach is essentially reverse engineering. Using a mass spectrometer, researchers look at preserved proteins and determine the amino acids that make them up. Because researchers know what three letter DNA sequence encodes each amino acid, they can then determine the DNA sequence for the protein. Its reading DNA when you dont have any DNA to read, Glendon Parker, a forensic scientist at the University of California, Davis, says in a press release. He and colleagues are developing proteomics techniques that can be used in criminology, evolutionary biology and anthropology. Protein is much more stable than DNA, and protein detection technology is much better now. The most stable protein that scientists know of is tooth enamel, which can remain intact in fossils for millions of years. Enrico Cappellini of the University of Copenhagen and colleagues focused on this protein in a new study in the journal Nature. The researchers took a miniscule amount of enamel from the tooth of a 1.77 million year old Eurasian rhinocerous species called Stephanorhinus, which was dug up in Dmanisi, Georgia. The DNA had long since degraded, but mass spectrometry allowed the team to retrieve genetic data from the enamel, the oldest ever to be recorded, according to another press release. For 20 years ancient DNA has been used to address questions about the evolution of extinct species, adaptation and human migration, but it has limitations. Now for the first time we have retrieved ancient genetic information which allows us to reconstruct molecular evolution way beyond the usual time limit of DNA preservation, Capellini says. This new analysis of ancient proteins from dental enamel will start an exciting new chapter in the study of molecular evolution. The finding has big implications for evolutionary biology. While DNA is scarce, tooth enamel is plentiful. Tooth enamel seems to protect its protein almost like a little time capsule, co author and chemist Kirsty Penkman of the University of York tells David Behrens at The Yorkshire Post. Its a step forward from Darwin. He was making his predictions based on the shape of boneswere now able to get molecular information from the bone and the teeth. The potential for this to be applied to a huge range of different species, including humans, is enormous. Scientists already have a massive amount of material for genetic analysis available at their fingertips. There are tons of these fossils sitting around in museums and in sediments around the world, and we can now get useful evolutionary information from them, Penkman says. One of the potential applications of this technique is sorting out the human family tree. Currently, the oldest DNA researchers have from human ancestors is about 400,000 years old, enough to tell us a little bit about Homo sapiens, Neanderthals and Denisovans. But beyond that, reports Phoebe Weston at The Independent, paleoanthropologists have primarily relied on changes in anatomy to decide if an ancient hominin is our direct ancestor. For instance, there is no direct genetic link between modern humans and Homo erectus, which may be a direct ancestor. Some evidence also suggests that early humans interbred with Homo erectus. A genome from that species would help iron out the relationship. The new technique has already shaken up the family tree of ancient rhinoceroses. According to the paper, the enamel DNA reveals that the Stephanorhinus rhino is not a direct ancestor of the better known woolly rhino, which survived until the Pleistocene about 10,000 years ago, but is a sister lineage and the two likely evolved from a common ancestor. And this probably isnt the only branch on the tree of life that will be reshaped by proteomics in the near future. Editors note, February 17, 2021 A previous version of this article used the phrase DNA Data in the headline to describe how researchers used the rhino tooth to make inferences about the creatures DNA without needing a DNA sample. It is more accurate to use the phrase Genetic Material rather than the specific term DNA in this case. The story has been edited to reflect that."}, {"title": "Massive \u2018Ice Dragon\u2019 Ruled the Skies Above Ancient Alberta", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "September 11, 2019", "doc": "Some 77 million years ago, you would have been wise to keep a wary eye on the skies above what is now Alberta, Canada. Thats because one of the largest flying animals to ever exist called the province home. The species, described in a new study, is actually not all that new. It was dug up in Dinosaur Provincial Park in 1992, and its skeletal remains were kept at the Royal Tyrrell Museum. Back then, however, paleontologists assumed it was a specimen of an azhdarchid pterosaur with a 32 foot wingspan called Quetzalcoatlus northropi. First dug up in Texas in 1972, Quetzalcoatlus was the largest flying animal to ever live. Azhdarchid pterosaurs, however, are one of the most difficult ancient creatures to classify since the remains of their delicate bones are rare and fragmentary. Over the last 15 years, other species of azhdarchids have been unearthed in Europe and North Africa, allowing researchers to better understand the characteristics and differences within the group. When researchers took another look at the 1992 fossil, they were better able to compare it to Quetzalcoatlus. In particular, they examined the neck vertebra, which contains pneumatophores, or holes where air sacs once were that are now used to identify pterosaur species. The neck holes showed that the specimen was different from all other azhdarchids, indicating it was a new flying giant. The creature, named Cryodrakon boreas in honor of the ice dragon in Game of Thrones, is described in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. As Michael Greshko at National Geographic reports, the specimen from the Royal Tyrrell had a wingspan of about 16 feet and was likely a juvenile, but another incomplete bone at the museum that is believed to be from the same species shows that it reached mammoth proportions, with a wingspan of more than 30 feet, 8 foot tall shoulders when standing on ground and an estimated weight of 550 pounds. Based on the fossils studied, Cryodraken appears to have had a long neck but not quite as long as the similarly huge Quetzalcoatlus, lead author David Hone, a paleontologist at Queen Mary University of London, tells the CBC. It likely lived in a tropical environment hunting mammals, lizards and small dinosaurs.   Really as soon as I started looking in detail it was clear there were some differences between the two, first author David Hone of Queen Mary University London tells Hannah Osborne at Newsweek. I think a fair number of researchers have suspected as much for a while, but sitting down to do the work and getting into the details takes time. Understanding how these massive beasts took to the skies has applications outside of paleontology. This particular group of pterosaurs includes the largest flying animals of all time, co author Michael Habib of the University of Southern California says in the release. Their anatomy holds important clues about the limits of animal flight and may be important in the future for biologically inspired mechanical design for flight. But that understanding is coming slowly, since so few well preserved fossils of the animals have been found. Its an ongoing challenge for paleontologists to piece together how the ridiculously huge azhdarchid pterosaurs launched themselves into the sky and flew, Armita Manafzadeh, doctoral candidate at Brown University, tells George Dvorsky at Gizmodo. As we continue to learn more about the diversity of these critters and their body plans, were slowly gathering the information that we need to better understand how they moved over 70 million years ago. Habib says understanding these giant flying hunters is also crucial for getting a full understanding of how life evolved during the Cretaceous. These are among the most popular and charismatic of all fossil animals, he says in the release. They have been inspiration for countless movie monsters, they were critical parts of global ecosystems worldwide during the Age of Dinosaurs, so they are key to understanding the ecology and extinctions of that time, and, just like flying animals today, they could carry important clues about how animals at the time responded to major changes in climate."}, {"title": "The Long, Strange Tale of the Hand Beast Footprints", "author": "Hans-Dieter Sues", "date": "September 11, 2019", "doc": "In Arthur Conan Doyles A Study in Scarlet, the legendary sleuth Sherlock Holmes observes There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps. Happily, I have laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me. Holmes is able to distinguish the separate tracks of two men from the many footmarks of the constables on the scene. He can calculate when the men arrived, and by the length of their stride, can determine their height. He also determines that one man is fashionably dressed from the small and elegant impression left by his boots. Countless crime scene investigators have used footprints to apprehend culprits, but footprints are also a valuable resource for studying ancient animals. In many rock formations, tracks are the only remaining record that paleontologists can find of animals that lived millions of years ago. We can identify the creatures who made fossil footprints if the imprints are well preserved. The details in these will often reveal the configuration of the bones in the hands or feet and even show traces of skin on the palms and soles. From the length of the stride, researchers can also calculate the speed at which the animal moved. Sometimes, however, the shape of the footprints can be misleading. Take for example, a set of footprints found in 1833, in a small town in Germany. The fossil footprints, discovered during a construction project, confounded the great naturalists of the day. And, therein lies a tale. Friedrich Sickler, the high school principal in the town of Hildburghausen, first discovered the fossils. He was building a garden house when he noticed strange imprints on the sandstone slabs that were used for this construction project. The sediment was part of what today is termed the Buntsandstein, meaning colored sandstone, which represents the early part of the Triassic Period in much of Europeabout 252 to 248 million years before the present. Sickler offered rewards for more tracks to the workers in the sandstone quarry and soon a large surface covered with the footprints was exposed. The hind feet imprints looked like large human hands with prominent thumbs. The much smaller front feet left only imprints of the fingers. Unable to identify the maker of these tracks, Sickler published an open letter in 1834 describing his discovery to the famous German physician and naturalist Johann Friedrich Blumenbach. Word of Sicklers find quickly spread and many naturalists weighed in with interpretations of the track maker. Europes natural history museums rushed to acquire track bearing slabs cut from the quarrys sandstone surface. Researchers made learned guesses at what sort of creature could have left the tracks. The legendary explorer Alexander von Humboldt believed that they were made by a marsupial. Another naturalist insisted the prints were the tracks of a giant ape and still others offered up animals as varied as giant toads and bears. Finally, the German naturalist Johan Kaup named the unknown creature Chirotherium, which means simply hand beast in Greek. A few years after Sicklers discovery, Chirotherium tracks were found in Cheshire, England, and later also in France and Spain. Naturalists remained at a loss. The unusual footprints were turning up in other locations but without any known skeletal remains of backboned animals to help identify what could have left them. In the 1840s, two famous Victorian scientists, Sir Richard Owen and Sir Charles Lyell, developed theories about the animal responsible for the Chirotherium footprints. From rocks in Warwickshire, Owen identified a few bones similar in age to those from Cheshire as belonging to large amphibian precursors. He named these animals Labyrinthodon because of the labyrinthine folding of the dentine in their teeth. Owen surmised that Labyrinthodon could have made the tracks of Chirotherium. A few years later, Owen began working with the British artist Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins to build the first life sized reconstructions of prehistoric animals for the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. The models, recently restored, are still on view in a park in Sydenham, London. The two men envisaged Labyrinthodon as a giant toad like creature that looked like it had escaped from the nightmarish paintings of Hieronymus Bosch. Lyell, who is considered the father of modern geology, meanwhile, wondered how the Chirotherium would have ambulated because the thumbs of the tracks were pointed to the outside of the foot. Using the Owen Hawkins model of Labyrinthodon, Lyell surmised that the animal must have walked with its feet crossed Other researchers found Lyells reconstruction implausible, but they could do no better. Little changed until 1925. Thats when a German paleontologist named Wolfgang Soergel decided to review all available specimens of Chirotherium held in German collections. Looking at the feet of many living reptiles, he realized that the thumb had been misidentified because previous researchers had been so heavily influenced by its similarity to a human thumb. It was, in fact, Soergel pointed out, the fifth toe sticking out from a five toed hind foot. Measuring the trackways, Soergel, then, reconstructed the limb posture and proportions of the Chirotherium track maker. In Soergels model, the creature would have had strong hind legs and short forelegs, both of which were held much more upright than in living reptiles. The hind feet left large impressions whereas the front feet barely touched the ground. Much like our fingers and toes, well preserved footprints had distinct crease lines, which allowed Soergel to reconstruct the arrangement of bones in the digits. But the question still remained what animal left the Chirotherium footprints? After an extensive search, Soergel noted that a two foot long reptile named Euparkeria roaming South Africa early in the Triassic also had a foot with its fifth toe sticking out to the side. Euparkeria is an ancient precursor of both crocodilians and dinosaurs. Although the reptile that made the Chirotherium tracks was quite a bit larger than little Euparkeria, Soergel inferred that the Chirotherium track maker was probably related to the South African reptile. Enter the famous German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene, who in the late 1920s was conducting fieldwork in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. A German doctor had sent him crates of unusual bones found there and dating from the Triassic. While in Brazil, Huene became acquainted with a local resident named Vincentino Presto, who knew of a promising deposit of such bones. In 1942, Huene recovered the remains of a large predatory reptile that he christened in honor of Presto, Prestosuchus. This creature attained a length of at least 20 feet and is distantly related to crocodilians. When Huene reassembled its foot bones he noted a striking resemblance to the foot skeleton that Soergel had reconstructed for the maker of Chirotherium. Huene had come across a major clue about the track maker. The Chirotherium tracks were probably left by a reptile related to Prestosuchus. However, at that time, nothing like Prestosuchus had ever been recognized in Europe and other scientists remained unconvinced by Huenes interpretation. It was decades later, in 1965 that another major clue emerged, when the French paleontologist Bernard Krebs described the nearly complete skeleton of a ten foot long crocodile relative found in Triassic rocks of the Ticino region in Switzerland. Krebs named his creature Ticinosuchus, Latin for crocodile from the Ticino, noting that its feet were near perfect matches to the Chirotherium footprints and its body form closely matched Soergels reconstruction. Furthermore, the rocks containing the remains of Ticinosuchus were the same geological age as those with Chirotherium. It was a promising connection. Meanwhile in 2004, the town of Hildburghausen, looking for its rightful place in history, dedicated a monument to the decades long long search for the track maker. It featured the reconstructed original sandstone surface with the Chirotherium tracks but the bronze reconstruction of a crocodile like reptile was still not quite accurate. There was one last chapter in this long saga. It involved another reptileCtenosauriscus, which is Greek for comb reptile, and was from the Buntsandstein of Germany. Very tall spines on its backbone probably supported a sail along the back of the animal. The 2005 publication of a skeleton of the closely related Arizonasaurus in the Moenkopi Formation of Arizona established that the German Ctenosauriscus belonged to the same group of crocodile like reptiles as Prestosuchus and Ticinosuchus. The Moenkopi Formation is nearly the same geological age as the German Buntsandstein and has also yielded many footprints of Chirotherium. Now at long last, the Holmesian quest for the maker of the Chirotherium footprints has come to an end. It was crocodile precursors like Arizonasaurus, Ctenosauriscus, Prestosuchus and Ticinosuchus, that had left these prints. Tracks that resemble those of Chirotherium have now been found on most continents. Some possibly represent precursors of dinosaurs. Many other kinds of fossil footprints have been found, hinting at the existence of as yet unknown animals awaiting future discovery. As Sherlock Holmes would have said The game is afoot."}, {"title": "What Happened the Day a Giant, Dinosaur-Killing Asteroid Hit the Earth", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "September 9, 2019", "doc": "One of the greatest scars on our planet is hidden beneath the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and the Gulf of Mexico. The buried crater, over 90 miles in diameter, was created when a massive asteroid struck the planet 66 million years ago and brought a calamitous end to the reign of dinosaurs. Now, thanks to a new analysis of core samples taken from the craters inner ring of mountains, called a peak ring, geologists can create a detailed timeline of what happened on the day after impact. The immense Chicxulub crater is a remnant of one of the most consequential days in the history of life on Earth. The asteroid strike triggered the Cretaceous Paleogene, or K Pg, mass extinction. The catastrophe not only decimated the dinosaurs, leaving only birds to carry their legacy, but also annihilated various forms of life from flying reptiles called pterosaurs to coil shelled nautilus relatives called ammonites. Lizards, snakes, mammals and more suffered their own setbacks. The best clues to what happened now lie buried in rock layers stacked 12 miles deep. Using a core sample collected in 2016, University of Texas at Austin geologist Sean Gulick and a team of dozens of other researchers have further pieced together the story of the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction. We interpret this section to represent the first day post impact, which by the definition of the geologic time scale, makes it the first day of the Cenozoic since the Cretaceous ended the moment the asteroid struck, Gulick says. The teams study, The first day of the Cenozoic, was published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The drill site was selected to investigate the series of events that followed the impact. When an asteroid the size of the Chicxulub impactor, estimated to be more than six miles wide, strikes a planet, material is ripped up from below the surface and tossed into the air, collapsing in circular mountain range within the crater. Such devastating upheaval triggers a cascading sequence of natural disasters, sending tsunamis rolling across the oceans and ejecting an immense amount of debris into the atmosphere. The core sample is a geologic document stretching hundreds of feet long. Under a thin ring of overlying material is over 400 feet of melt rock that was laid down during the day following the impact. This isnt the first drill core from Chicxulub, says University of New Mexico geologist James Witts, but because of its position on the peak ring, which is essentially a range of mountains created in the moments after the impact event, it provides a really unique picture of the sort of dynamic geological processes that operated over short timescales. An event of this scale has never occurred in human history, he adds, so the rock record is essential to parsing out the details. Within minutes of the asteroid strike, Gulick and colleagues found, the underlying rock at the site collapsed and formed a crater with a peak ring. The ring was soon covered by over 70 feet of additional rock that had melted in the heat of the blast. The sea battered against the new hole in the planet, and in the minutes and hours that followed, surges of water rushing back into the crater carried laid down more than 260 additional feet of melted stone atop the already accumulated rock. Then a tsunami hit. The wave, reflected back toward the crater after the initial impact, added another distinct layer of rocksediments of gravel, sand and charcoalall within the first 24 hours of the strike. The planetary collision triggered wildfires inland, burning forests that were later doused by devastating waves. Debris from the charred woods washed out to sea, and some accumulated in the crater. What we have from drilling at ground zero is a fairly complete picture of how the crater formed and what the processes were within the crater on the first day of the Cenozoic, Gulick says. The impact affected life far from the site. The heat pulse would have raised temperatures over 900 miles away, Gulick says, and at farther distances the ejecta could also have caused fires by frictional heating as it rained down in the atmosphere. The rocks that the asteroid struck were rich in sulfur, which was ejected and vaporized, mixing with water vapor and creating what Gulick calls a sulfate aerosol haze. Geologists had detected and studied this effect before, but the new research reinforces the role this atmospheric disruption played in the extinction that followed. Our results support this scenario where first you burned parts of the continents, and then you had global dimming of the sun and plummeting temperatures for years to follow, Gulick says. These events account for the loss of 75 percent of known species at the end of the Cretaceous. Had the impact occurred elsewhere, or in a place of deeper ocean water, the extinction may have happened differently, or not at all.  Cores from Chicxulub crater reveal the planet wide devastation that the large impactor caused, but the timing of these events will likely spur debate and discussion, Witts says. The complication with relating individual deposits in the core to specific types of events is that clearly the crater wasnt a static environment after formation, Witts says, meaning that earthquakes, waves and other events have altered the rock record over the course of 66 million years. Still cores like the one taken from the peak ring show that we can get a close up look at short term events in the rock record, down to minutes, hours and days. Scientists knew the first day of the Cenozoic started with a bang, and now they have a better sense of the fallout."}, {"title": "Fossil Mix-Up Could Rewrite the History of Beetles, the Largest Group of Animals on Earth", "author": "Joshua Rapp Learn", "date": "September 9, 2019", "doc": "The most diverse family of animals on the planet just got a little bit younger due to a possible mix up in the fossil record. Rove beetles have more than 60,000 living species. The beetles are spread all over the world and have adapted to a great number of ecological niches. The only problem is that Leehermania prorovathe presumed oldest known member of the speciesmay not be a rove beetle at all. Its not related to that group of beetles at all but related to a smaller group of beetles, says Martin Fik\u00e1\u010dek, a collection curator and researcher in the insect department at the Czech National Museum in Prague and a co author of a study about the beetle published today in Systematic Entomology. If Leehermania prorova is not a rove beetle, but rather a beetle related to the Myxophaga suborder as Fik\u00e1\u010dek and his group believe, it could mean the four beetle suborders we know today are much older than previously believed. Since insects represent the largest animal class 72 percent of all known animal species, according to the Catalogue of Life, and beetles represent about 35 percent of all known insects and 25 percent of all known animals, with about 400,000 named species, a better knowledge of beetles can help us understand some of the fundamental processes of evolution. Its an important question to get this right, because this is in fact not just the largest beetle family but the largest family in the animal kingdom, says Joe Parker, an assistant professor in biology at the California Institute of Technology. So understanding how old it is and how its diversified into so many species is really a key piece of information for understanding animal evolution in general. Leehermania prorova is about 226 million years old, but the species first came to the attention of scientists after fossilized specimens about as big as the width of a nickel were found along the Virginia North Carolina border in the 1990s. Photos circulated for a couple decades, exciting beetle biologists, but it wasnt until 2012 that a study described the species as the oldest known rove beetle. This claim raised eyebrows among some beetle researchers around the world, and a collective dialogue opened up about the proper taxonomy of Leehermania prorova, lasting for several years between Fik\u00e1\u010dek and beetle researchers in China, Japan, Europe, Australia and the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The new study is based on this collective effort, making the case that Leehermania prorova was not a rove beetle at all, but something more closely related to a skiff beetle. Skiff beetles belong to Myxophaga, one of the other four extant suborders of beetles along with Polyphaga, the suborder which includes rove beetles. In contrast with the latter order, Myxophaga is a relatively small suborder with only a few dozen species. The insects of this suborder are also tinymost skiff beetles are about 1 millimeter in size. Leehermania prorova is only about 2 millimeters in size as well. Other characteristics are difficult to tell from the fossil, but Fik\u00e1\u010dek says that one clue is what the 2012 authors believed were visible mandibles, or lower jaws, characteristic of rove beetles. The recent study, however, identifies these features as appendages called maxillary palpi. This is basically a small segmented leg like thing next to the mouth which helps the insect manipulate food, Fik\u00e1\u010dek says. Skiff beetles and others from their order have hidden mandibles, since the mostly aquatic beetles feed on things like algae. If the mandibles of Leehermania prorova were really more leg like, it could mean the species actual mandibles were hidden as well. Furthermore, the antenna on Leehermania prorova didnt quite look like those of a rove beetle, and it lacked certain features on its abdomen usually present in rove beetles. You have to be careful not to misinterpret things, Fik\u00e1\u010dek says, adding that another group of Myxophaga also looks a lot like rove beetles. People make mistakes about fossils quite frequently because its not easy. The authors of the 2012 did not respond to a request for comment on the new research, but Parker, who was not involved in either study, believes the evidence more strongly favors the recent papers placement of Leehermania prorova in the Myxophaga group. This fossil has been contentious since its description in 2012, he says. Adam Brunke, an entomologist who studies beetles at the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids and Nematodes in Ottawa who was not involved in either study, says that this research represents the gold standard in modern paleontology because its a synthesis of all available evidence from both living and extinct species. He says that Fik\u00e1\u010dek and his co authors conclusion is robustly supported, and that their arguments are more compelling than those of the 2012 study. This is not to say that the story is finished, new fossils that are better preserved or show different features could reveal that the beetle species belongs somewhere else in the Myxophaga tree, Brunke says via email. The specimen of Leehermania prorova is an important fossil due to the paucity of such samples that have survived the eons. Fossils of proper beetles there are many fossils of proto beetles in Permian and Triassic deposits from the Triassic are very rare, and Leehermania, regardless of its systematic placement, is one of our only glimpses of what beetles were around right after the end Permian mass extinction, Brunke says. Any fossil only gives researchers the minimum age rather than the maximum age of a species. But the new classification could mean that the age of all beetles is pushed back. When researchers thought the species was a unique ancestor of the rove beetle, it hinted at the time period when these beetles evolved. But if the species is from the skiff beetles suborder, it would push back the origin of that group by about 100 million years. Rove beetles, on the other hand, could be about 50 million years younger than previously estimated. Leehermania prorova doesnt look as different from modern skiff beetles as researchers expect an ancient ancestor to look, Fik\u00e1\u010dek says, which means that the real ancestors of the whole Myxophaga had to be older, quite likely much older actually. If Leehermania prorova is a skiff beetle, it may provide evidence against a previous theory that the modern beetle orders evolved after the mass extinction at the end of the Permian about 250 million years ago. Leehermania is the first opening of the black box, Fik\u00e1\u010dek says in an email. As far as explaining the evolutionary success of rove beetles, Fik\u00e1\u010dek and Parker say that the evidence that they are youngerabout 176 million years oldmeans that the most successful family of animals would have diversified rather quickly. Their soft abdomens, which contrast with other beetle species, may have allowed them to move through leaf litter and get into niche habitats such as the burrows of other animals, tree bark and a number of other places to find food and hide from predators. One of the ideas that people have is that this actually helped the rove beetles to inhabit and use space and niches which few other insects used at that moment, Fik\u00e1\u010dek says. Rove beetles may still be as old as thought, even if Leehermania isnt one. New fossils will have to fill in the incomplete picture of entomological evolution. But regardless of their age, rove beetles are certainly one of the most successful groups of animals to crawl the Earth."}, {"title": "Special Skull Windows Helped Dinosaur Brains Keep Cool", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "September 4, 2019", "doc": "Dinosaur skulls have something in common with Swiss cheesetheyre both full of holes.

The prehistoric skulls of dinos may have held special blood vessels that allowed the animals to keep their brains at just the right temperature. The specialized pocket sits within an opening on the top rear of the skull called the dorsotemporal fenestra. This opening plays a role in jaw muscle attachment, and scientists previously thought it was filled with the fibrous tissues that allowed dinosaurs to bite. But a curious pocket within the larger hole, called the frontoparietal fossa, seems to have served a different purpose. While researching jaw muscle attachments in reptiles, University of Missouri anatomist Casey Holliday noticed that the frontoparietal fossa didnt seem to have much to do with chomping. I wasnt finding any evidence to support the presence of a muscle and so had to start figuring out what else it could be, Holliday says. Among living reptiles, Holliday and colleagues found the area in question houses fat and blood vessels. Digging in further, the research team compared the past to the present. In addition to detailed examinations of fossil dinosaur skulls, the paleontologists also looked to some of dinosaurs closest living relativesAmerican alligators and wild turkeysto see if there might be unidentified soft tissues in this skeletal divot. Their results were published today in The Anatomical Record. The researchers found that the skull pocket had little to do with chewing. Both living birds and crocodylians have a pad of blood vessels and fat sitting in the cavity atop the underlying musculature. The skull pocket isnt jam packed with muscle fibers, as it would be if the features only function were to increase the force of a bite. Instead, quite a bit of vasculature runs just below the skin, suggesting blood vessels could serve as temperature regulators in the head, and non avian dinosaurs like Velociraptor show the same anatomical hallmarks. I think the authors present a strong case for the presence of specialized vascular features in the frontoparietal fossa, says University of Florida anatomist Catherine Early. Additional work may revise the details, Early notes, but the new research changes what scientists previously expected of reptile anatomy. Looking at temperature profiles of modern alligators helped explain why ancient reptiles might have needed a network of blood vessels in the back of their heads. Holliday and colleagues took thermographic images of alligators at Floridas St. Augustine Alligator Farm and Zoological Park at different times of day. In the cool of the morning, the area with the relevant skull opening was relatively warm compared to the rest of the reptiles. The alligators had warm brains even as their bodies hadnt yet caught up. In the heat of the afternoon, the pattern reversed. The alligator brains were relatively as ambient conditions raised the reptiles body temperatures. Thermography revealed that this pocket of vessels was identifiable via heat signatures, and that it seems to vary in temperatures relative to body surface temperature throughout the day. Taking thermal images of wild and captive alligators was a treat, Holliday says, but he notes that the process can be challenging and even dangerous up close. Next come the drones to get such images from a distance. While we cant directly observe Allosaurus without a time machine, the crocodylian clues suggest that ancient dinosaurs had this network of blood vessels for much the same reason as their modern relatives. The vasculature of the frontoparietal fossa fits into a network of vessels that help animals regulate brain, eye and body temperature, Holliday says. Shunting blood through this skull network could keep their brains warm or cool, which would have been particularly important given that dinosaurs likely had elevated body temperatures and similar metabolisms to birds and mammals rather than lizards. Dinosaurs may have been prone to overheating, and so conveniently located blood vessels would have allowed cooler heads to prevail. What stands out to me is that this paper synthesizes evidence on how archosaurs in general are using cranial vasculature to thermoregulate, Early says. What alligator heads are doing today provides us with a window to better understand creatures that lived millions of years ago. The blood vessel networks may have had another advantage as well. Dinosaurs like the triple horned carnivore Ceratosaurus and many tyrannosaurs had skull ornaments, or lavish head displays, in the vicinity of these blood vessels. The bone would have been covered in keratin in life, nourished by the same cardiovascular system that controls temperature. The blood vessels that helped dino brains warm or cool could have also allowed these animals to develop extravagant headgear, co opting a temperature function into something flashy, such as the tube like crest of Parasaurolophus or the long brow horns of Pentaceratops. Additional research is required, Holliday cautions, but notes that if youre going to have a giant structure growing off your head like dinosaur frills and horns, or duckbill crests, or tyrannosaur excrescences, there needs to be blood to supply it. The blood vessels might have even nourished as yet undiscovered head features, like combs, wattles, snoods or crests. A newly analyzed hole in the back of the skull might provide clues that dinosaurs were even flashier than ever expected."}, {"title": "How to Discover Dinosaurs", "author": "Hans-Dieter Sues", "date": "September 3, 2019", "doc": "Dinosaur skeletons are the pride and joy of every natural history museum. As throngs of visitors come to marvel at the sizes and unusual shapes of these skeletons, few realize what it takes to find and collect these treasures. It is a job that is physically demanding, requiring long hours in the fieldkneeling in the dirt, roasting in the hot sun with the sweat dripping from your brow, while often ignoring back pain and biting insects. However, I can attest, the excitement of uncovering remains of animals that lived countless millennia ago far outweighs any discomfort. People always ask, How do you know where to dig? Well, first we have to find a dinosaur skeleton before we can dig it up. To collect dinosaurs requires careful planning. Unless they are called on to salvage a skeleton already found during construction or mining, paleontologists begin their search for dinosaurs by studying geological maps and reports to identify locations where the rocks might yield dinosaur bones. After securing the necessary fieldwork permits, team leaders select volunteers, assemble equipment and purchase supplies. For off road transportation, four wheel drive vehicles are a must. The ideal places for dinosaur hunting lack any vegetation cover and are far from human habitation. The best places for finding dinosaurs here in the United States are in Colorado, Montana, Utah and Wyoming. The most exotic places that Ive traveled in pursuit of dinosaur fossils have been China, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Today, the best dinosaur collecting is in Argentina, China and Mongolia. To begin a search at a site, collectors slowly walk across miles of exposures of strata, carefully scanning the ground for bone on the surface. It takes a practiced eye to be able to quickly distinguish fossil bone from the rock. The differences might only be subtle nuances in color and texture. Once exposed from the rock by wind and rain, dinosaur bones will quickly crumble into pieces. Thus, collectors look for clusters of these broken, weathered pieces. A trickle of bone fragments might lead to a larger source, which, if luck is at hand, leads to more complete remains still buried in the rock. The initial excavation of a skeleton is done with picks, shovels and jackhammers. This can be physical demanding labor because a lot of overlying rock often has to be removed before the bone layer is exposed. Once the bone is exposed, we use small hammers, chisels, awls and dental picks to trace the outlines of the bones in the rock. Exposed bone surfaces are often fragile after countless millennia in the ground and require a thin coat of adhesive to strengthen them. Solutions of synthetic polymers, such as polyvinyl acetate, in acetone or ethanol, are used for this purpose. It is important to leave enough rock around bones to protect them during transport to the laboratory. It is imperative to keep detailed documentation concerning the location of a fossil skeleton and its geological context. These data allow paleontologists to determine the geological age of the remains and reconstruct the ancient environment in which the dinosaur lived and died. Without this information, the scientific value of the specimen is greatly diminished. As a first year graduate student at the University of Alberta, my first experience was the excavation of a skeleton of an 80 million year old duckbilled dinosaur. The fossil had been found weathering out of a hillside along the South Saskatchewan River in southern Alberta, Canada. The rich brown color of its bones stood out beautifully against the grayish white sandstone. A few tail vertebrae had been exposed and some digging revealed that much more of the skeleton extended into the hillside. A team from the university spent much of the summer excavating the bones, which turned out to be embedded in a hard sandstone. We had to proceed with care with our duckbill as some limb bones were preserved separate from the rest of the skeleton. The skeleton was large, and we had to divide it into several blocks in order to transport it. We covered each block of the bone bearing rock in burlap strips, cut from old flour bags and dipped in wet plaster. First, a layer of damp tissue paper was applied to the bones to prevent the plaster from sticking to them. Then layers of plaster bandages were tightly molded to the surfaces of each block. Any loose pieces of bone were wrapped and bagged separately. Once a first round of plastering was completed, we dug trenches around the plaster jackets until they each were supported only by a small pedestal of rock. Then the jackets were turned over and their undersides fully plastered. Pieces of wood or pipe were inserted into the plaster to increase the strength of each jacket. Once dried, the plaster jackets formed a sturdy shell protecting the dinosaur bones inside. Our dig site was on the side of a cliff so a backhoe was brought in to build a dirt road for moving the blocks up the slope to a truck for transport back to the university. Individual blocks of plaster jacketed bone bearing rock can weigh hundreds of pounds or more. The actual removal of the bones from the rock encasement takes place in the laboratory. The technician opens the plaster jacket using a circular saw. In most cases, the bones are slowly freed from the rock using dental tools and air scribesa type of tiny jackhammer. Fine details and small bones are cleaned using carbide needles mounted in pin vises. Broken pieces are mended with adhesive and gaps are filled in with plaster or epoxy resin. This work, once done by stone masons, demands a lot of skill and tremendous patience. Today it is undertaken by specially trained technicians. Most dinosaurs discovered to date are not known from even partial skeletons. Some species are documented only by a tooth or a leg bone. However, even such fragmentary remains often show distinct features that give enough information that paleontologists are able to identify the kind of dinosaur. When I did fieldwork a few years ago in Uzbekistan with colleagues from that country along with paleontologists from Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we collected many beautifully preserved but isolated bones and teeth representing a considerable variety of 90 million year old dinosaurs. Among these remains were teeth and bones that belonged to a horse sized, meat eating dinosaur with blade like teeth. The first finds only told us that these remains documented the presence of a tyrannosaur, but not whether it represented a new species, or an already known one. Then the team found a tyrannosaur braincase that clearly differed from the braincases of other known tyrannosaurs. This new tyrannosaur became Timurlengia euotica in honor of the 14th century Central Asian ruler Timur Leng Tamerlane or Timur the Lame. Because the inner ear showed that this dinosaur had keen hearing, we named the new species euotica Greek for well hearing. Collecting large dinosaur skeletons often takes a considerable investment of time and effort. A good example of this is the spectacular skeleton of the Jurassic dinosaur Diplodocus that graces the new fossil hall at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. It was collected by the Smithsonians legendary dinosaur hunter, Charles Whitney Gilmore and his crew at Dinosaur National Monument in Utah in 1923. It took him and his technicians almost eight years from the recovery of the skeleton from a steep cliff of hard sandstone to the completion of the mounted skeleton for display. Gilmore was never happy about this gargantuan effort because he considered the dinosaur primarily of interest as an exhibit but yielding little if any new scientific information. Indeed, millions of visitors have since admired this 90 foot ancient giant. But contrary to Gilmores expectations, the skeleton continues to be of great interest to paleontologists. Most recently, a team of European researchers re examined all known specimens of Diplodocus and its close relatives. Their study upended the traditional classification of these dinosaurs. The Smithsonian skeleton was re identified as belonging to the uncommon species Diplodocus hallorum, the first specimen of which had been reported as Seismosaurus in reference to its enormous size. The Smithsonian skeleton also has unusual features in its tail. Some of the tail vertebrae are fused together and their spines are oddly shaped. Paleontologists consider these features pathological and are still exploring what they might tell us about the life of this ancient giant. Undoubtedly, the Smithsonians skeleton of Diplodocus will remain an important resource for future scientific studies on this and related dinosaurs. Gilmores eight years of work turned out to be a good investment."}, {"title": "A 3.8-Million-Year-Old Skull Puts a New Face on a Little-Known Human Ancestor", "author": "Brian Handwerk", "date": "August 28, 2019", "doc": "Spotting the intact Australopithecus skull in the Ethiopian dirt caused paleoanthropologist Yohannes Haile Selassie to literally jump for joy. It was something that Ive never seen before, and Ive seen a lot of cranial fossils, he says. The chance discovery by Haile Selassie and an Ethiopian shepherd has created a captivating portrait of 3.8 million year old face, providing an unprecedented look at a hominin species from a key stage of human evolution. Experts say the extraordinary fossil can help redefine the branches of humans evolutionary tree during a time when our ancestors had just evolved efficient ways to walk upright. This cranium looks set to become another celebrated icon of human evolution, Fred Spoor, a human evolution researcher at the Natural History Museum in London, writes in a News  Views article that accompanied Haile Selassie and colleagues new study in the journal Nature. The amazingly complete skull surfaced at Woranso Mille, in Ethiopias Afar region, back in 2016. But it has taken 3 and a half years of hard work to answer the first question that arosejust what kind of skull is it? Haile Selassie and colleagues compared the skull dubbed MRD after part of its collection ID number with a wide variety of hominin fossils from across Africa. They sized up different morphological features to see what species the cranium represents and where it fits in the interconnected lineages of our family tree. The results identify the skull as belonging to a male Australopithecus anamensis. The hominin species is theorized to have vanished a bit earlier than 3.8 million years ago after giving rise to a later lineage, Australopithecus afarensis, to which the famed fossil Lucy belongs. A. anamensis has traits of both apes climbing arms and wrists and humans changes in the ankles and knee joints to facilitate walking on two feet. Most previous fossil specimens of A. anamensis are limited to small bits of bone, such as a tooth, partial jaw, or fragment of arm or shin. The opportunity to study a nearly complete braincase and face confirms the southern ape as a unique species and shines light on the differences between two of our most ancient hominin ancestors, A. anamensis and A. afarensis. Most of A. anamensis own traits are quite primitive, Haile Selassie says, noting the individuals small brain, protruding face and large canine teeth. There are a few features exclusively shared with A. afarensis, like the orbital region in the frontal area. But everything else is really primitive. If you look at it from the back, it looks like an ape. This is something that I never expected to see in a species that is hypothesized to be the ancestor of A. afarensis. So it changed the whole gamut of ideas in terms of the relationship between those two. The skull also casts doubt on prevailing ideas that the older lineage directly gave rise to the younger, instead suggesting that the two lived together, coexisting for at least 100,000 years. But the study authors stress that its still quite possible that early populations of A. anamensis gave rise to A. afarensis perhaps 4 million years agothey just didnt die out immediately afterwards. Probably a small population of A. anamensis isolated itself from the main population, underwent major changes, and over time distinguished itself from the parent species of A. anamensis. Thats probably how A. afarensis appeared, Haile Selassie says. The research team argues that the relationship between the two ancient hominin species, believed to be ancestors to our own genus Homo, may be a prime example of a nonlinear evolutionary scenario common in other non human species. Anagenesis, when one species evolves so completely into another species that the progenitor disappears, is not the primary way the branches on our family tree diverged. Just because one species gave rise to another, it doesnt mean that the source species ancestor disappeared, Rick Potts, head of the Smithsonians Human Origins Program who was not involved in the new study, says via email from a dig in Kenya. Weve known for some time that the human family tree is branching and diverse, like the evolutionary trees of almost all other species. The new cranium is significant because it illustrates this pattern of biodiversity in a poorly known period of hominin evolution, just as our ancestors evolved a stronger and stronger commitment to walking on two legs. Paleoanthropologist Meave Leakey and colleagues reported in 1995 that A. anamensis was the first known species to evolve an expanded knee joint that allowed each of its legs to briefly bear all of its body weight during bipedal walking. Bipedalism set our ancestors apart from the apes, enabling ancient hominins to take advantage of a wider range of habitats than those available to tree climbers. A second, related study helped to more precisely date the cranium fossil by investigating minerals and volcanic layers where it was found. The work also helped describe the long vanished world in which A. anamensis and his kin lived. The skull was buried in sand that was deposited in a river delta on the shores of an ancient lake. The sediment deposits also held botanical remains, revealing that the environment around the ancient lake was predominantly dry shrubland, but there was a mixture of other local ecosystems as well. There were forests around the shores of the lake and along the river that flowed into it, but the surrounding area was dry with few trees, Beverly Saylor, a geologist at Case Western Reserve University and lead author of the second study, said at a press conference. The evidence suggests that, like contemporaries from other sites, the male hominin likely dined on a tough, ape like diet of seeds, grasses and similar fare. Haile Selassie and colleagues have been working in the area of Woranso Mille, Ethiopia, for 15 years. When a local shepherd showed up in camp to announce the find of some intriguing fossils, Haile Selassie was skeptical, especially because locals had often dragged him to visit supposed fossil sites simply because they needed a ride somewhere. He asked Habib Wogris, the local chief who organizes fieldwork in the region each year, to take an hour long walk with the shepherd to visit the site of his find. The chief has seen a lot of teeth of hominins from the site and he realized that this tooth looked like a hominin tooth, Haile Selassie says. As soon as he returned and opened his hand and I saw the tooth, I said, Where did you find it? They said, lets go and well show you. The fossil site was in the regions high ground, where the shepherd had moved his flock to escape seasonal flooding in lower areas. Hes been living there like three months with his goats, and he saw the fossil when he was digging a hole for his newborn goats to make a protection for them from jackals and hyenas, Haile Selassie says. On site, the shepherd showed him where the tooth had been lying, and Haile Selassie surveyed the surroundings looking for other fragments. Three meters from where I was standing there was this round thing, just like a rock, and I said oh my goodness, Haile Selassies recalls. His reaction, literally jumping up and down with excitement, made the shepherd remark that the doctor had gone crazy. I speak their language, and I said no the doctor is not going crazy. Hes just excited, Haile Selassie laughs. With the rare fossils formal unveiling today, the excitement of the initial find three years ago has spread throughout the community of scientists looking to put a human, or hominin, face on our distant ancestors."}, {"title": "Ancient Sea Life May Have Hitched Across Oceans on Giant Living Rafts", "author": "Hakai Magazine", "date": "August 12, 2019", "doc": "Todays oceans are jammed with plastic, which not only pollutes the water and poisons its inhabitants but also carries some animals to distant destinations. As researchers rush to discern the imminent repercussions of these virtually indestructible plastic rafts on global ecosystems, others are turning to the past to explore whether this buoyant lifestyle is actually new. The subject of their study? A giant of the Jurassic era the crinoid. Crinoids look more like plants than animals, but they are invertebrates related to sea stars and sea urchins. With floweresque crowns atop stems reaching 26 meters in length, crinoids living in the Jurassic were one of the worlds largest known invertebrates. In warm prehistoric seas, a subset of these behemoths used their anchor like stems to grip floating logs and surf in colonies hundreds strong. And with them, life may have spread far and wide. For marine and terrestrial organisms alike, rafting may be a key dispersal mechanism. In fact, rafting may have been one way islands like New Zealand were initially colonized by some organisms. But drifting crinoid communities represent the earliest example of rafters in the fossil record, says Aaron Hunter, an evolutionary paleoecologist at the University of Cambridge in England. According to Hunters newest statistical analyses, logs carrying rafting crinoids could float on even the most hostile oceans for a decade or more. Rafting crinoids and their driftwood vessels, Hunter says, would have created a little island of activity in an otherwise nutrient poor ocean. Though the rugged mussels that accompanied the crinoids remain as relics of this early mode of marine transport, no other passengers were preserved. Hunter speculates that crinoid rafts could have ferried additional stowaways including plants, bryozoans and crustaceans. Animals such as fish might have also trailed in their wake, feasting on the travelers. Michael Simms, a paleontologist at National Museums NI in Northern Ireland who was not involved in Hunters research, theorizes that these buoyed communities could have traveled thousands of kilometers, provided they could make it to the open ocean without getting caught in currents or sinking. They might have even traversed entire oceans, he speculates, although the exact routes they took cant be extrapolated from the fossil record. Although this rafting lifestyle was once the subject of intense debate among crinoid researchers, most now agree that at least two crinoid lineages spent tens of millions of years rafting. Scientists initially estimated that crinoids floated for a few years. More recently, Hunter, Simms and others have extended these estimates to at least a decade, maybe two. Depending on factors like ocean currents, rafting longer could mean rafting farther for the crinoids and their passengers. Simms based his calculations on observations of modern driftwood to surmise how long ancient logs could have stayed afloat, even encrusted by crinoids. Hunter, meanwhile, is using statistical approaches to analyze crinoid fossils and reverse engineer their time of death. These methods, he hopes, will add credence to the rafting hypothesis and derive more accurate estimates of floatation duration. Rafting crinoids flourished until roughly 180 million years ago, when, some scientists think, the appearance of wood boring organisms like shipworms drastically curtailed their drifting ways. Once their vessels collapsed, the crinoids would plummet to the bottom of the ocean, in many cases becoming frozen in time by the oxygen starved seabed. Modern crinoids no longer raft attached to logsinstead, some species get around by crawling along the seafloor or swimming with feathered arms. But that hasnt stopped the rafting process for other species. Now, creatures looking to hitch a ride enjoy a fleet of vessels even more durable than Jurassic driftwood plastic. Every day we throw plastic in the ocean, so there is a continuous supply of tickets for these travelers, says Martin Thiel, a marine biologist at the Catholic University of the North in Chile. In 2015, Thiel and his colleagues reported that nearly 400 different types of organisms have been found rafting on floating litter, a figure that has only grown. Compared to Jurassic logs, most plastics are highly resistant to decay. Forget decades, these plastic rafts could theoretically drift for centuries. Figures like these raise concerns about the threat of invasive species, which now have a new way to surpass their natural distributions. According to Lars Gutow, an ecologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, invaders riding on plastic rafts are a major threat to biodiversity that could lead to the homogenization of species on a global scale. But for Hunter and Simms, Jurassic crinoids are a good reminder that rafting is not new. While some in the scientific community were shaken by recent reports of organisms rafting on plastic and other debris for upwards of five years after the 2011 Japanese tsunami, Hunters reaction was, Wow, thats too short. Just like the ancient crinoids, he says, these tsunami born travelers could have floated for decades but ultimately bumped into land. Many of these travelers, he thinks, may still be out there. What makes todays plastic rafters different from Jurassic crinoids, though, is that no wood boring organism will expedite their demise. The durability of plastic means that the full impact of these impervious rafting communities on native species has yet to be seen. As Simms says, its a great time to be a rafting organism, but a terrible time to be almost anything else."}, {"title": "Archaeologists Uncover Evidence of an Ancient High-Altitude Human Dwelling", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "August 9, 2019", "doc": "Life in high altitude mountains can be rough. Resources are scarce, the weather can be extreme and oxygen levels hover at dangerously low levels. Archaeologists have thus assumed that towering mountains and plateaus were among the last places to be populated by ancient humans. But a new study suggests that this assumption could be wrong. Published in the journal Science, the research details a remarkable discovery in Ethiopias Bale Mountains at a site located more than 11,000 feet above sea level. There, a team of experts unearthed a trove of artifactsamong them stone tools, clay fragments, burnt animal bones and a glass beadindicating that people had lived there as early as 47,000 years ago. These finds, according to the study, represent the earliest evidence of a prehistoric high altitude human residential site. For decades, paleoanthropologists working in east Africa have been concentrating their attention on lower altitude locations. We were simply the first to go higher, Go\u0308tz Ossendorf, an archaeologist at the University of Cologne and lead author of the new study, tells Carl Zimmer of the New York Times. But reaching Fincha Habera, as the site of the new discovery is known, was no mean feat. The research team had to trek more than 700 miles on foot and by pack horse to get to the site. The effort was worth it. At Fincha Haveraone of more than 300 elevated rock shelters that the researchers investigatedthey quickly dug up signs of ancient human occupation. Crucial to their discovery were the remnants of hearths, which provided charcoal that could be dated to between 47,000 and 31,000 years ago, according to Zimmer. The new findings are not, however, the first clue that our ancestors ventured to high altitudes earlier than experts once thought. Earlier this year, for instance, scientists reported the jawbone of a Denisovanan extinct hominin speciesthat was discovered in a cave some 10,700 feet above sea level in China. The specimen was dated to around 160,000 years ago. Also significant was the discovery of stone tools high on the Tibetan Plateau, with the relics dating between 30 and 40 thousand years ago. But the Fincha Habera finds offer unusually robust evidence of humans actually living at high altitudes. The settlement was probably not a permanent one. Prehistoric humans at that time were mobile hunter gatherers, so they never stayed sedentary at a single site, Ossendorf tells Charles Q. Choi of Live Science. But, Ossendorf notes, the evidence suggests that prehistoric people spent considerable amounts of time at the site. In fact, Fincha Havera was repeatedly populated by humans the teams analysis shows that around 10,000 years ago, a second group moved into the site, increasingly using it as a hearth. In spite of the challenges of high altitude living, Fincha Haveras ancient occupants may have seen it as prime real estate. They inhabited the site during the Last Glacial Maximum, when much of the Bale Mountains were covered with icebut Fincha Havera was located beyond the icy region. Melting glaciers would have offered an ample supply of water, perhaps more than could have been found in lowerand driervalleys. Food seems to have been plentiful at Fincha Havera, as the researchers found abundant burnt bones, mostly of giant mole rats, the study authors write, suggesting the sites inhabitants were roasting rodents for meals. They also seemed to have been using nearby obsidian outcrops to make their tools. The settlement was therefore not only comparatively habitable, but also practical, says Bruno Glaser, study coauthor and expert in soil biogeochemistry at the Martin Luther University of Halle Wittenberg in Germany. The researchers plan to return to Fincha Havera for additional excavations, according to Zimmer. Ideally, they would like to find the bones of the humans who lived thereeven more ideally, bones with extractable DNA. Such a find could help scientists learn more about how ancient humans adapted to high altitudes and whether those adaptations have been inherited by mountain dwelling peoples of the present day."}, {"title": "Fossil Trees Reveal the Oldest Known Forest in Asia", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "August 9, 2019", "doc": "Paleontologists are generally thrilled to find pieces of an ancient tree or a few well preserved fossil leaves, but researchers in China recently hit the mother lode, uncovering an entire fossilized forest covering about 2.7 million square feet. The trees are the oldest found in Asia, providing insights into how the root systems of modern forests developed. The research appears in the journal Current Biology. Hannah Osborne at Newsweek reports that the forest was discovered in 2016 in the Jianchuan and Yongchuan clay mines near the village of Xinhang, in the east central part of the country. The ancient trees are visible in the walls of the quarry, including the trunks and structures resembling pinecones. The lycopsid trees date back to the Devonian period 365 million years, making them the oldest known forest discovered in Asia. But this forest was no towering cathedral of trees. Maya Wei Haas at National Geographic reports that its difficult to gauge the height of the lycopsid trees because many of the tops were broken off during fossilization. But researchers estimate that, based on the size of the trunks, the trees maxed out at about 10 feet with most in the five  to six foot range. The ancient lycopsids didnt look like modern trees either. Jan Zalasiewicz, a University of Leicester paleobiologist not involved in the study, writes for The Conversation that the species of tree, part of  the new genus Guangdedendron, had no flowers or seeds. The short trees had trunks fringed with leaves and four short drooping branches at the top with bottle shaped structures on their tips that spread spores. He describes the trees as a little like a green, living version of an art deco streetlamp. A modern visitor might not recognize the lycopsid grove as a forest at all. The large density as well as the small size of the trees could make Xinhang forest very similar to a sugarcane field, although the plants in Xinhang forest are distributed in patches, lead author Deming Wang of Peking University says in a press release. It might also be that the Xinhang lycopsid forest was much like the mangroves along the coast, since they occur in a similar environment and play comparable ecologic roles. Its likely the forest was once part of a coastal swamp that periodically flooded. Those floods, its believed, buried trees in sediment, allowing them to fossilize. The most striking part of the trees, at least for those interested in their evolution, are the roots, which are much more advanced than researchers believed they would be during the Devonian period. Wei Haas reports that the Xinhang trees have stigmarian roots, or branching roots covered in rootlets. These same types of roots allowed trees in the swampy Carboniferous period that followed to grow much taller. Those swamps full of decaying trees eventually formed the coal seams that humans discovered hundreds of millions of years later. This is what fired the Industrial Revolution, Cardiff University paleobotanist Christopher Berry, not involved in the study, tells Wei Haas. This is the basis of our present civilization this little root structure, which we see for the first time in this forest. These early forests and their roots had other major impacts as well. Zalasiewicz writes that as these early forms of land vegetation proliferated, they stabilized river banks, creating new habitats where early animals including amphibians and millipedes could move onto land. And the tall, rooted trees also began sucking up and locking away so much carbon dioxide that it changed the atmosphere, plunging the world into 50 million years of glaciation. There are so many trees in the clay pits that Wang says theres still much more to learn about the stumpy little forest. The continuous finding of new in situ tree fossils is fantastic, he says in the press release. As an old saying goes the best one is always the next one."}, {"title": "Fossils Reveal Why Coyotes Outlived Saber-Toothed Cats", "author": "Meilan Solly", "date": "August 6, 2019", "doc": "Saber toothed cats are often envisioned as fierce predators stalking the open savannah in pursuit of bison, horses and other grassland dwelling prey. But a new study published in the journal Current Biology paints a different portrait of the long extinct Smilodon fatalis. As researchers led by Vanderbilt Universitys Larisa DeSantis found, fossils recovered from the La Brea Tar Pits in California suggest the up to 600 pound cat actually preferred hunting in the forest, where easy targets, including tapirs and deer, congregated en masse.  These findings, based on an analysis of more than 700 fossil teeth belonging to multiple prehistoric species, contradict the idea that competition among carnivores drove saber toothed cats and other megafauna to extinction some 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. For instance, most ancient canine predators, like dire wolves, stuck to the open fields. The cats, including saber toothed cats, American lions and cougars, hunted prey that preferred forests, while it was the dire wolves that seemed to specialize on open country feeders like bison and horses, DeSantis explains in a press release. While there may have been some overlap in what the dominant predators fed on, cats and dogs largely hunted differently from one another. Per CNNs Ashley Strickland, the scientists research pinpoints a different explanation for S. fatalis and other giant cats demise, positing that factors, including climate change and an uptick in nearby human populations, precipitated the species eventual extinction. The team is collaborating on a second study with experts across six institutions to further refine these causes, Chrissy Sexton notes for Earth.com. Smaller predators such as coyotes and grey wolves, on the other hand, weathered harsh conditions by adapting to the times. As DeSantis tells National Geographics John Pickrell, When the large predators and prey go extinct, not only do the smaller animals shrink, but they fundamentally change their diet and start scavenging to become the opportunists we know today. According to Pickrell, DeSantis and her colleagues arrived at their conclusions by studying microscopic patterns of wear on fossil teeth, as well as the proportions of two carbon isotopes found within tooth enamel. These isotopes, passed along from plant eating prey to carnivorous predators, identify victims preferred habitat as open versus forested environments. Since excavations began around 100 years ago, the La Brea Tar Pitsbubbling pools of natural asphalt that attracted predators and prey alike, entrapping both within its sticky depthshave yielded more than 3.5 million specimens representing some 600 species. Most of these unlucky animals were carnivores lured in by the carcasses of horses, bison and camels already caught in the tar rather than escaping with an easy meal, the predators soon found themselves similarly stuck. Previously, research on the La Brea remains has focused on carbon and nitrogen isotopes found within a bone protein called collagen. These analyses all arrived at the same conclusion Prehistoric predators from saber toothed cats to dire wolves and American lions hunted in open environments, competing for the same limited pool of prey. But as Julie Meachen, a Des Moines University paleontologist who was not involved in the study, explains to National Geographic, tooth enamel is far more reliable than collagen, emerging from centuries underground completely intact. When we look at the enamel, we get a totally different picture, DeSantis tells Pickrell. We find that the saber tooth cats, American lions, and cougars are actually doing what cats typically do, which is hunting within forested ecosystems and using cover to potentially ambush their prey. In the statement, DeSantis says the research offers new insights on the long term consequences of giant cats extinction. The animals around today that we think of as apex predators in North Americacougars and wolveswere measly during the Pleistocene, she concludes. So when the big predators went extinct, as did the large prey, these smaller animals were able to take advantage of that extinction and become dominant apex predators."}, {"title": "After 30 Years, a South African Dinosaur Is Identified as a New Species", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "August 5, 2019", "doc": "In 1978, a complete dinosaur skull and partial skeleton were discovered on a farm in the Free State province of South Africa. Paleontologists believed that the remains belonged to a member of Massospondylus carinatus, a long necked species that frequently appears in southern Africas Lower Jurassic geologic formations. The fossil was ultimately sent to the University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, where it has been stored for the past 30 years. But from the start, it was clear that something wasnt quite right with the specimen, which was catalogued as BP14779. Its skull, for one, was boxier than that of Massospondylus, prompting some researchers to assume that it had been distorted during the fossilization process. As Ian Sample reports for the Guardian, BP14779 was also smaller than adults of the Massospondylus species, which could reach a length of around 20 feet, leading to the theory that the fossil represented a juvenile. Now, a re analysis of the remains has brought experts to a different conclusion. The fossil, according to a study published in the journal Peer J, belongs not to Massospondylus carinatus but to an entirely new speciesone that had been hiding in plain sight, study co author Paul Barrett tells Josh Davis of Londons Natural History Museum. In order to determine that the fossil was not a Massospondylus, the researchers had to compare it to known Massospondylus specimens of different ages. That would have been hard to do with many other dinosaurs, because it is rare to have a complete age series of fossils from a single species, Kimberley Chapelle, lead study author and doctoral researcher at the Natural History Museum, tells Davis. Luckily, she adds, the most common South African dinosaur Massospondylus has specimens ranging from embryo to adult. The researchers were therefore able to perform CT scans on a series of Massospondylus skulls, some of them tiny, some of them fully grown adults. And when they scanned the BP14779 skull, they observed more than 20 features that set it apart from all other sauropodomorphs, the group to which both Massospondylus and the mystery fossil belong. The team thus concluded that BP14779 is a previously undocumented species, which they have dubbed Ngwevu intloko, meaning grey skull in Xhosa, one of South Africas official languages. Ngwevu intloko was a bipedal creature, with a long neck and broad head. It was a plant eater, though it likely also preyed on small animals when it got the chance. Sample reports that the dinosaur measured around 13 feet in length and may have weighed up to 660 pounds. The new species skull did not align with growth patterns observed in the range of Massospondylus specimens, leading the researchers to reject the hypothesis that it was a juvenile Massospondylus. In fact, according to the study authors, Ngwevu intloko was around 10 years old when it died and had reached nearly adult size. The team also found that the differences between Ngwevu intloko and Massospondylus could not be chalked up to crushing or compression during the fossilization period the Ngwevu intloko bones simply did not display the sorts of breaks that one would expect had its remains been seriously disrupted. This new study is particularly intriguing because it adds further nuance to our understanding of life after the Great Dyinga mass extinction event that occurred 250 million years ago, wiping out some 90 percent of the planets species in a span of 20,000 years. It was in the wake of this natural disaster that dinosaurs emerged, among them Massospondylus. Researchers used to believe that Massospondylus was the only sauropodomorph thundering through southern Africa in its time, managing to thrive in a depleted landscape. But recent research has shown that there were actually six or seven sauropodomorph dinosaurs in this area, as well as variety of dinosaurs from other, less common groups, Barrett tells Davis. The studys identification of Ngwevu intloko thus bolsters the notion that Massospondylus lived in a more complex ecosystem that scientists previously thought. It also highlights the importance of using advanced technologies to take a fresh look at very old fossils. As Barrett points, according to Sample, Museum collections, even those that are heavily studied, often have the potential to surprise us with finds of brand new species."}, {"title": "Scientists and Miners Team Up to Preserve Opalized Fossils", "author": "Undark Magazine", "date": "August 1, 2019", "doc": "Cloaked in white dust and surrounded by expansive plains, the town of Lightning Ridge produces the bulk of the worlds precious black opal. This rare gemstone, prized for its dazzling play of color, hides out of sight in the Australian outback beneath a town roughly 450 miles northwest of Sydney. And for more than 100 years, people have come to the Ridge to find their fortune chasing precious opal. As it turns out, these miners have been uncovering not just opal, but opalized fossils Bones, teeth, shells and plant material turned to opal, embedded in the ancient claystone and preserved, like the gemstones, for 100 million years under a thin veneer of sediment. Some of the opalized fossils unearthed at Lightning Ridge represent animal species found nowhere else, and they are packed with information from the Cretaceous Periodthe tail end of the age of the dinosaurs. The prehistoric remainssome smaller than a fingernailcan be found edging out of mine face, or in the piles of discarded opal bearing dirt, churned out by miners by the truckload. If it were not for the opal minersmany of whom have sharp eyes and regard the fossils with as great a sense of awe as paleontologists dowe would not have, or know anything about, these fossils, says paleontologist, gemologist and long term resident of the Ridge, Jenni Brammall. As valuable as the fossils might be to science, miners are usually the first to lay eyes on them, and this presents a conundrum Opal miners hold the mineral rights to whatever opal they find in their registered mineral claim, and that includes opalized fossils. When money gets tightand it often doesa miner might destroy an opalized fossil in the hope of extracting saleable precious opal, or sell the fossil overseas where it can fetch a hefty sum. Sometimes they keep the fossils they find for their sentimental value, leaving them tucked away in private collections. For decades, Brammall and a small group of peers have been treading a fine line to help the community understand the value of opalized fossils while urging them to donate particularly rare finds. A cornerstone of their efforts is the Australian Opal Center, which was founded in the late 1990s and has quickly outgrown its small showroom on the main street of town. The center holds the most diverse public collection of opalized fossils in the world, largely amassed through donations by opal miners, many of whom bestow their finds through the Australian Governments Cultural Gifts Program, which offers tax deductions to donors. But despite these efforts, countless opalized fossils are being lost to the black market, pushed out of the reach of research institutions by the highest bidder. This is why Brammall and her colleagues are ramping up their efforts, planning and designing an iconic museum and research facility to be built at the historic Three Mile opal field outside of town to showcase the unrivalled natural heritage of the region. They are also working to raise funds to purchase precious fossils unearthed at the Ridge so they can be preserved in perpetuity in a public collection, accessible to both the community and researchers. The mining community, which is struggling through the current drought and always at the mercy of opal buyers and their temperamental tastes, recognizes that things need to change to ensure a sustainable future for the town, and they are largely supportive of the paleontologists efforts. Echoing other residents, Barbara Moritz, who came to Lightning Ridge with an opal miner in the 1990s, says the new Australian Opal Center cant come soon enough.  Opal is found commonly around the world, but precious opal is very rare and geologists say nothing compares to that produced in Central Australia. Opalized fossils have likewise been found at other opal fields in Australia, but Lightning Ridge stands out for preserving the greatest diversity of extinct freshwater and land living creatures, including dinosaurs galore. A hundred million years ago, the now arid interior of Australia was flooded by a vast inland sea, and Lightning Ridge sat on its edge. As the sea retreated, the leading theory goes, it exposed a peculiar mix of sediments forming a sandstone laced with reactive minerals. Rocks nearer the surface began to weather, producing a groundwater rich in silica. It lay in cracks in the rock and filled any cavities, including the skeletal remains of dinosaurs and other long extinct creatures. Elizabeth Smith, a paleontologist who has studied the opalized fossils of Lightning Ridge for decades, has seen it all sharks teeth, turtle bones, lungfish, pinecones, birds, marine reptiles, plus all sorts of dinosaur bones and teeth. Teeth are the most revealing, Smith explains, particularly the ones comprised of so called common opal, which lacks the brilliant color of precious opal but may be translucent. To be able to see the very fine scale anatomy inside the tooth, the serrations, is really something, she says. Smith was first drawn to the Ridge in the 1970s, long before the Australian Opal Center was even a whisper on the horizon. She later moved to live there permanently when opal mining was booming in the 90s. While her husband was digging for opal, Smith was searching for fossils. Now, alongside Brammall, she is working to find a way forward where opalized fossils benefit the whole community. The pair talk often and openly with opal miners about the wondrous fossils of Lightning Ridge so that people appreciate just how extraordinary they are. Still, Smith says, over the years, she has seen some mighty important fossils held in private hands, or sold overseas. Speak to any opal miner and theyll be quick to tell you their treasures are hard won. Opal mining is grueling work, physically and emotionally, and a good way to go broke very quickly, says Kelly Tishler, a third generation miner from Lightning Ridge. Miners mostly work alone or in pairs, and many live off grid in self made shacks or caravans on their mineral claim, a small plot of government owned or private land where miners hold an exclusive license to prospect and mine for opal. Some have secondary businesses to supplement their income. Petar Borkovic, for example, runs Outback Opal Tours with his wife. But Im an opal miner. Its in my blood, he says, grinning through the noise at the Sheepyard Inn, a pub in the middle of the Grawin opal fields, southwest of Lightning Ridge. Before the Australian Opal Center was in town, specimens of interest that had been acquired from miners were sent to far away natural history museums, including the Australian Museum in Sydney, where two of Lightning Ridges most famed fossils reside. Steropodon galmani was the first mammal from the Mesozoic Era found in Australia, and Kollikodon ritchiei, the second. Taken together, they hint at the diversity of Australias early mammals. These tiny specimens, little more than an inch long, are immensely important, says Matthew McCurry, curator of paleontology at the Australian Museum. Theyre among the earliest representatives of mammals here in Australia, McCurry explains, and, when they were discovered, the oldest trace of monotremes in the world. Any opal specimen is of immense scientific value because it offers a unique window into Australias past, says fellow paleontologist Paul Willis, an adjunct associate professor at Flinders University in South Australia. Our imagination might run wild with the dinosaurs that roamed through the Jurassic and into the Cretaceous, but mammals also proliferated during that time, including the ancestors of Australias unique egg laying monotremes, the platypus and echidna. Willis knows all too well how fortunate scientists and all Australians are to have these specimens in public collections. As a Ph.D. student at the University of New South Wales in the 1980s, he was tasked by the Australian Museum with reconstructing the fossilized skeleton of a small marine reptile, a pliosaur, which had been haphazardly excavated by opal miners in Coober Pedy in South Australia. Eric, as the pliosaur was nicknamed, remains the most complete opalized vertebrate fossil skeleton found to date, but it arrived, unceremoniously, at the museum in a box. A wealthy property developer had purchased the skeleton and was paying for it to be prepared for display. That is, until he went bankrupt. Suddenly, Eric was up for grabs. A public fundraising campaign raked in more than 500,000 Australian dollars so that the museum could acquire the national treasure and put it on show. It has taken similarly sizeable sums to secure other one of a kind opalized fossils so they can be duly recognized in public collections and protected for generations to come. The first mammal from the Mesozoic Era found in Australia, Steropodon galmani, was purchased by the Australian Museum in 1984 as part of a collection of opalized fossils from opal dealers David and Alex Galman for AU80,000. The second, Kollikodon ritchiei, on its own, had an AU10,000 price tag.  More than 80,000 people visit the Ridge each year, a number that continues to rise. Many come specifically to see the opalized fossils on display at the Australian Opal Center. One morning in late April, the showroom is crowded with groups of people hovering around the display cabinets. Several visitors approach Smith to ask about Weewarrasaurus, having come all the way to Lightning Ridge for the dinosaurs and hoping to see the latest gem in the centers collection. Just last year, a new species of plant eating dinosaur was described from an opalized jawbone with a few ribbed teeth intact that was found near Lightning Ridge. It was named Weewarrasaurus pobeni for the opal dealer, Mike Poben, who generously donated the sparkly specimen to the Australian Opal Center after he discovered it, miraculously, in a bag of rough opal purchased from miners from the Wee Warra opal field. After meeting visiting paleontologist Phil Bell, who knew immediately it was something extraordinary, Bell says Poben decided to donate the fossil to make sure it became known to the world. Having the Opal Center in the town as part of the community is absolutely vital to safeguarding these treasures, says Bell, a lecturer at the University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia. There is a very real concern amongst people in Lightning Ridge that their fossil material stays in its place of origin, adds Smith. The community, she says, understands the scale of what has been lost. The material has been coming out of the ground the whole time the miners have been digging, but the presence of fossilsand their scientific valuehas only come to light gradually over the last few decades. Brammall and Smith share their expert fossil knowledge with the miners who bring them to the Australian Opal Center, asking for help to identify a specimen, so miners can understand the history they hold in their hands. The miners often have outrageous ideas about what theyve found, which Smith says is all part of the fun, but every now and then, someone brings in something really significant. From her wallet, she retrieves a tiny opalized tooth that she has on loan from an opal dealer. Smith thinks it is a crocodile tooth but points out the unusual features at its base. It will be photographed and then returned to the owner. Whether or not it comes into the collection, Ive got no idea, she says. We rely on the minersand for them to do the right thing, Smith says. Alas, opalized fossils continue to be sold on a daily basis as highly prized collectors items, and paleontologists are unable to recover them. Money has always been the problem. Having spent tens of thousands of dollars to keep digging, their savings sunk into machinery and fuel, few miners are in a position to hand over opalized fossils, and museums have, for decades, lacked the necessary funds to purchase them at fair prices. We are losing our cultural heritage because we do not have the funds to secure these opal fossils, attests Willis. Exporting opalized fossils from Australia without a permit is outlawed under the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act of 1986, but the biggest markets for opal are outside of Australia and a miner might just be looking to make ends meet. In dire times, things get unsentimental. One thing about opal mining is you cant tell another opal miner what to do with his or her opal, declares Tishler, gazing out at the rocky ridges from the overturned Three Mile opal field, one of the first fields in the area. A self confessed fossil nut, Tishler says she has her own private collection of opalized fossils, which she plans to bequeath to the Australian Opal Center, but she also admits to selling her grandmothers opal jewelry in times of hardship. Brammall and Smith focus on what they can do for the Lightning Ridge community, not what has been lost. We gain more than we lose, says Brammall of their efforts, which start with regarding miners as collaborators and treating them with the respect they deserve. Encouragingly, one major opalized fossil haul from the Ridge, an assemblage of dinosaur bones, including the worlds most complete opalized dinosaur skeleton, recently came into the collection 31 years after it was first discovered. In the future, an acquisition fund would mean that the Australian Opal Center could respond swiftly and need no longer rely on limited federal funding when such treasures are on offer. But the first step has been to secure backing for the world class facility that will house and display the growing Australian Opal Center collection. It is hoped that the museum heralds a new future for Lightning Ridge, one that recognizes the deep history of the land and the legacy of opal mining alongside the celebrated opalized fossils while drawing new visitors to the remote town and providing a long awaited global hub for opal related science and education. With funding from local, state and federal governmentsand a significant contribution from the community itselfthe new center has been designed by renowned Australian architects and construction will be soon be underway. For Smith, the new museum represents a long held promise to the community. She knows of a few fossils of major scientific importance out there in private hands, which others agree would be game changing in their respective fields. Smith keeps the specimens in her sights, tantalizingly close, believing that the new Australian Opal Center will embolden more people to share their fossil collections. They want their fossils safe, Brammall says, in a public collection, on the opal fields.  Clare Watson is an Australian writer and freelance journalist specializing in science.

The answer isnt the latest Guillermo del Toro creature creation. Its Cambroraster falcatus, a 506 million year old invertebrate that was one of the top predators of the ancient seas. The early arthropod is described today by Royal Ontario Museum paleontologists Joe Moysiuk and Jean Bernard Caron in Proceedings of the Royal Society B Biological Sciences. The Cambrian animal, whose name refers both to its rake like appendages and a body shape that recalls the Millennium Falcon of Star Wars, isnt quite like anything alive today. In technical terms, Cambroraster is a hurdiid radiodont, or an early arthropod belonging to a group with pineapple shaped mouths and grasping appendages that included the first known large predators. The iconic Anomalocaris from the same vicinity is a relative. The startling nature of Cambroraster took a few years to come together. The first specimens were found in 2014, Moysiuk says, as paleontologists explored the Cambrian rock of Canadas Kootenay National Park. It was immediately clear that the animal, roughly resembling a modern horseshoe crab, was new to paleontology. The carapace that covered the head of Cambroraster looked like nothing we had seen before. But there wasnt just one fossil. Over years of fieldwork, researchers found hundreds of specimens, and paleo sleuthing back at the Royal Ontario Museum allowed Moysiuk and Caron to come up with a detailed picture of the entire animal. Given that most relatives of Cambroraster are known from bits and pieces, the chance to perceive and study an entire specimen offered a rare look at an enigmatic group of animals. With Cambroraster we have everything preserved, and we have specimens showing how different body parts articulated with each other, Moysiuk says. Cambroraster resembles a mix of similar animals that have recently been uncovered. Among other radiodonts, the head shield of Cambroraster covers much more of the body than other species, University of Lausanne paleontologist Allison Daley says. The mouthparts of Cambroraster also resemble those of a related animal called Hurdia, she notes, but are spinier, and this mix of characteristics makes Cambroraster stand out. In life, adult Cambroraster would have been about a foot long, which may seem relatively tiny by todays standards, but during its time, Cambroraster was one of the largest animals aroundand its anatomy suggests a rather voracious lifestyle. Cambroraster has a remarkable feeding apparatus consisting of a pair of frontal claws and a mouth ringed by toothed plates, Moysiuk says. And on those claws are spikes that make a comb like arrangement. Cambroraster likely used these appendages to sift through the seafloor sediment, devouring everything from worms to early fish relatives. But the invertebrates mouth is certainly its most frightening feature. After being captured in the claws, Moysiuk says, prey would have been sucked into the circular mouth and shredded by the multiple rows of large teeth. Hundreds of Cambroraster have been found, sometimes with dozens preserved in the same spot. Finding so many fossils of this animal isnt surprising, Daley says. The Kootenay fossil beds, like those of the nearby Burgess Shale, are world famous for their exceptional preservation. Many taxa, not just Cambroraster, are found very abundantly at these sites, which is part of what makes the Burgess Shale so special, Daley says. Furthermore, many of the Cambroraster fossils are isolated body parts that were relatively sturdysuch as the claws, head shield or mouth parts, some of which may have been cast off as molts. This shedding may explain the aggregations of multiple Cambroraster in one place, Moysiuk notes, as modern arthropods often come together to exuviate their old exoskeletons. Nevertheless, finding so many Cambroraster in a relatively small area indicates that there was a thriving local ecosystem with a rich food supply for this predatory sediment sifter. Paleontologists are still putting together the details of this lost Cambrian world. The place where Cambroraster is found is only about 24 miles away from the famous Burgess Shale, yet, Moysiuk notes, the animals found at Kootenay are more closely related to species found in China than their Canadian neighbors. Exactly why this should be the case is a matter of ongoing research, Moysiuk notes, and experts are still working through the list of unusual new creatures found at Kootenay. Since the discovery of Marble Canyon in 2012, a number of new species have been described and many more remain to come, Moysiuk says. And thats just from the fossiliferous rocks that have been explored so far. Kootenay includes many spots that have yet to be sifted over and likely hold never before seen species. Endemism, when a species is confined to a defined and specific geological location, was high in the Cambrian, Daley says. So every new site that has been recently discovered has many new species found there that are unique in the world. The more experts explore, the more familiar well become with the strange nature of Cambrian life."}, {"title": "Megalodon May Be Extinct, but There\u2019s a Life-size One at the Smithsonian", "author": "Erin I. Garcia de Jesus", "date": "July 29th, 2019, 10:19AM", "doc": "Smithsonian Voices  National Museum of Natural History \n\n Between 23 and 3.6 million years ago, dorsal fins taller than a modern day human protruded from the warm waters surrounding Washington, D.C. Such fins belonged to a formidable shark who once prowled the Chesapeake Bay region and oceans around the world Carcharocles megalodon. Today, a life size model of the now extinct predator hangs from the ceiling above the National Museum of Natural Historys new Ocean Terrace Caf\u00e9. Visitors entering the caf\u00e9 from the Ocean Hall come face to face with one of the largest and most powerful animals to have ever lived on Earth. A fearsome killer C. megalodon, often called simply megalodon, is famous for its massive size and sharp teeth. Its name in Greek means big toothed glorious shark  a fitting moniker for an immense and deadly hunter with chompers as big as a human hand. As the top predator of its day, megalodon feasted on small whales, sea turtles, seals and large fish in shallow seas around the globe. Its serrated teeth were handy for slashing through skin, fat, muscle and bone as it ambushed its prey from the side or from below. An average tooth measures around 5 inches from base to tip. The largest are around 7 inches long. Coupled with these saw like teeth was an extreme bite megalodons jaws generated 40,000 pounds of bite force. In comparison, saltwater crocodiles  award winners for living creature with the strongest bite  tear into their prey with around 3,700 pounds of force per square inch. Humans bite into a steak with only 150  200 pounds. There is nothing today that comes anywhere close, says Hans Dieter Sues, one of the Smithsonians Curators of Vertebrate Paleontology. Even Tyrannosaurus rex doesnt come close to that amount of pressure Then around 3.6 million years ago, Earths biggest shark disappeared. Most of the sharks skeleton was composed of cartilage, which rapidly decays and doesnt leave behind fossils. Now, all that remains of the magnificent megalodon are teeth, vertebrae and petrified poop. Giant of the seas In the 17th century, people believed fossilized megalodon teeth could counteract toxins and kept them as amulets, called tongue stones or glossopetrae. When Danish naturalist Nicholas Steno dissected a great white sharks head in 1666, he realized that tongue stones were in fact prehistoric shark teeth that belonged to something much bigger. Fossil vertebrae that look like gigantic ashtrays gave scientists the first idea of megalodons size. A partial backbone uncovered in Belgium in the 1920s had at least 150 vertebrae.    Female megalodons outsized males  a common feature among sharks. A female may have reached up to 60 feet in length and weighed up to 120,000 pounds. Males, on the other hand, were up to 47 feet long and tipped the scales at up to 68,000 pounds. The Smithsonians megalodon model is a female measuring 52 feet. Her size is based on a set of teeth uncovered in the Bone Valley Formation in Florida in the 1980s  the largest of which are 6.2 inches long. Most people have never been close to a shark like megalodon, Sues says. Theyll have an idea from the movies for what a shark looks like, but they wont have seen one up close unless theyve gone scuba diving. Building the beast The museums megalodon is suspended beneath panels of windows, where sunlight streams in to brighten her bronze back. Her mouth is open for visitors to glimpse three full rows of serrated teeth on her bottom jaw and two on the upper. Megalodon is not in an attack pose, ready to catch lunch. If not for the cables holding her in place, she might be idly swimming toward the viewer  though the 2,000 pound model still looks menacing. I was mindful that there might be little kids who would never go in the ocean if the model was too scary, Sues says. The behemoths body is based on a large group of related species  including great whites and salmon sharks. But megalodons closest relatives are not great whites, as many scientists once believed. Mako sharks are the best living representation of its extinct cousin, albeit much smaller. A mako shark would look puny next to a megalodon, says Sues. But the fish is still large by human standards Sues has a set of mako jaws at home and he can easily fit his head in its mouth. Sues and his colleagues, including artist Gary Staab, worked with experts to guarantee that the model depicted an active predator with the right shape to fit its lifestyle chasing whales. Where great whites have incredible girth, megalodon is more streamlined to match makos  the fastest sharks in modern oceans. Sometimes when you see megalodon reconstructions, they look like great whites on steroids, Sues says. But I dont think thats very likely because that kind of blimp would have a hard time swimming around and catching prey.  Megalodon is definitely extinct Pop culture has latched onto megalodon as a highlight for thrilling ocean themed tales. The ancient shark has been featured in novels and films. Mockumentaries on Discovery Channels annual Shark Week have prompted conspiracy theories that megalodon is somehow still surviving in the deep sea, evading detection. Another misconception is that the shark lived at the same time as T. rex, though a gap of 43 million years separates the two species. In the 2018 film The Meg  based on a novel by Steven Alten  megalodon resurfaces from the deepest part of the ocean to terrorize a research vessel. Its completely impossible because megalodon swam in shallow, coastal waters. The animal would implode at that depth, says Sues. But if it were possible, he thinks the films shark was nevertheless doomed. When I saw that the meg was up against Jason Statham, I knew that it had no chance, he says. Despite such fictional suggestions, megalodon remains extremely extinct. Changes in the ocean environment likely led to its disappearance. Earths oceans cooled as ice caps formed at the poles. North and South America connected via the Isthmus of Panama, blocking circulation between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Megalodons favorite prey  small whales  vanished and it had to compete with other hunters such as the predatory sperm whale Livyatan and modern great white sharks. By 3.6 million years ago, megalodon was gone.  Though the glorious big toothed shark is no longer around  and lived long after the dinosaurs  it is still a wonder to behold. Just steps away from the caf\u00e9s life size model, Smithsonian visitors can take a selfie with enormous megalodon jaws. Megalodon has a fascinating history    which makes it hard for Sues to pick his favorite thing about them. Im generally very partial to meat eaters, he says. Sharks are just amazing animals.

Within the lithified remains of a giant tree like fern were the bones of a tiny, 310 million year old animal. This animal was unlike any other seen thus far. It was able to venture where no vertebrate back boned animal had ventured before, deep into the lycopsid forests, away from the waters edge. This was all thanks to an evolutionary innovation the amniotic egg. Although animals had previously ventured onto land in the earlier Devonian Period, animals with an amniotic eggsuch as modern reptiles, birds and yes, even mammalsdo not need to return to the water to reproduce, as modern amphibians still do. The amniotic egg is a self contained pond, where the embryo and all its food and waste are stored surrounded by a protective, desiccation resistant shell. This new kind of animal, that Dawson would name Hylonomus lyelli, remains the earliest amniote in the fossil record. Since then, many other animals, some strange and some familiar, have been added to the list of discoveries at Joggins Cliffs at the Bay of Fundy. These include microsaurs, temnospondyls and Dendrerpeton acadianum. In 2008, the Joggins Fossil Cliffs were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. And the cliffs havent ceased sharing their secretseach colossal tidal cycle erodes and exposes more of the ancient ecosystem that once thrived in its formerly equatorial location. The initial discovery of the paleontological significance of Joggins took place in 1842, when British geologist Sir Charles Lyell travelled to Nova Scotia. Ten years later, Lyell and local geologist Sir William Dawson together studied the strata of the 310 million year old cliffs. Within the cliffs stood the bodies of giant trees, frozen in time. However, these trees are unlike those in forests today. Rather they were ancient, giant ferns that would have towered 20 to 30 metres above the forest floor. These ferns are what make Joggins in particular critical to our understanding of early tetrapod evolution. Thats because when they died, their soft inner cores rotted away, leaving behind their firm outer bark and a hollow interior. Its within these hollowed out stumps that animal remains were trapped and protected for over 300 million years, and where we find them today. Significant fossil finds at Joggins are few and far between. But its the unparalleled potential of the next big discovery that keeps me coming back to the site year after year. And we may now have the best chance of that next big discovery. After a back breaking, 15 year collaborative effort between the Nova Scotia Museum, Saint Marys University, Nova Scotian geologist John Calder, the Joggins Fossil Institute and Joggins native Brian Hebert, a new collection of giant fossiliferous treesrepresenting the largest collection amassed since the site was discoveredis ready for fresh eyes. Over the next number of years, meticulous manual preparation will reveal tiny new bones, one by one. What makes the newly discovered material so special is that it was collected from strata lower in the Joggins section than any previous material. The fossils within will become new earliest records of animals that we recognize as members of groups of animals that are still alive todayamphibians, reptiles and mammalsand many that are now extinct. We will see for the first time what these trailblazers looked like, and how many different kinds were present in this early phase of tetrapod evolution. These animals will teach us many new things about one of the most important phases in tetrapod evolution the establishment of the first terrestrial, vertebrate communities. We will analyze their anatomy and, through comparisons with living animals, learn about what these animals may have been doing when they were alive. For example, we can examine the condition of their teeth to learn about what they might have been eating. With the explosion of terrestrial plants at the time, we can see how long it took before animals became herbivorous, and how their strategies might be similar or alternatively, completely different, from those of modern day herbivores. We can also examine their bones to learn about what kinds of activities they were doing in these new environments. Were seeing evidence at slightly younger Carboniferous localities that animals had already begun diversifying ecologically. We see the first burrowing animalsand some possibly arboreal animals animals who spend most of their lives living in trees. Were the animals at Joggins already doing these things? If so, we would learn it took relatively little time for animals to exploit the many aspects of their new environment. If not, well then, it will appear as though it took some time for these trailblazers to get their footing in the terrestrial realm. Together these discoveries and new analyses will revise our understanding of the Carboniferous Period. No longer will we think of it as a boring, stagnant swamp filled with unspecialized creatures. A new picture is now emerging, one of a dynamic environment that quickly filled up with animals with many new adaptations and abilities.

In 2003, while excavating the enormous bones of a Supersaurus nicknamed Jimbo, Wyoming Dinosaur Center paleontologist Bill Wahl spotted something funny. About four inches above the main bone layer, in what was thought to be fossil free rock that could be chipped away, there lay an accumulation of tiny bones. At first, Wyoming Dinosaur Center paleontologist Jessica Lippincott says, it seemed like the remains might belong to a flying pterosaura non dinosaur reptile that lived during the same time. But further examination revealed that the bones represent something never seen before a new species of raptor like dinosaur, the oldest yet found in North America. We have the smallest dinosaur and the largest dinosaur found in Wyoming, both in the same quarry, Lippincott says. Those bones, representing a partial skeleton, were used to name the new dinosaur Hesperornithoides miessleri today in the journal PeerJ. Described by University of Wisconsin Madison paleontologist and artist Scott Hartman and colleagues, this dinosaur is categorized as an early member of a group of svelte, small, sickle clawed dinosaurs known to experts as troodontids. These were raptor like dinosaurs related to the group that contains more famous carnivores like Velociraptor, as well as the forerunners of birds. Found in the roughly 150 million year old rock of the western United States Morrison Formation, Hesperornithoides adds to a growing theme. Even though big dinosaurs such as Stegosaurus, Allosaurus and Apatosaurus have been known from the Morrison Formation for over a hundred years, experts are only just now filling out the ranks of smaller species that lived at the same time. Hesperornithoides is a stark reminder to paleontologists that little gems can be found hidden away in these same layers of rock, says University of Calgary paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky. Experts have been waiting to hear more about this rare find since its initial discovery. There have been rumors of this specimen for many years, and a few conference presentations, so paleontologists like me have been anxiously waiting for it, says University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte. Back in the Jurassic, Hartman says, Hesperornithoides lived in a fairly open, semi wet area with herbaceous plants, but no trees to speak of. This habitat, combined with details from the dinosaurs skeleton, indicate that the raptor relative was running along the ground rather than fluttering through the air. But the story is somewhat more complex than that. While Hesperornithoides wasnt a flier, the dinosaur may represent one of the earliest known forerunners of modern birds, helping to piece together a part of the evolutionary tree that remains incomplete. From related dinosaurs, Hartman and colleagues are confident that Hesperornithoides was extensively feathered. And in terms of skeletal anatomy, the dinosaur has traits that are associated with the origin of flight in other dinosaurs. Hesperornithoides has a curved wishbone, an important site of muscle attachment for arm muscles that were used for flight in early birds, as well as a particular wrist bone called the semilunate carpal that allowed for bird like folding of the hand under the arm. The skeletons of Hesperornithoides and other related species indicate that many of the prerequisites for dinosaurs to take to the air evolved on the ground first. The emerging picture isnt of straight line evolution, but rather dinosaurs with aerial abilities evolving multiple times from ancestors who lived on the ground. Some form of aerial behavior evolved several times in parallel, Hartman says, a significant concept for experts trying to understand the evolution of flight. Instead of being exemplars of how early birds evolved flight, iconic species such as Archaeopteryx and Microraptor may represent multiple origins of aerodynamic skills like fluttering or gliding. The new study proposes that birds capable of powered flight evolved independently from other flight related skills, and likely from a dinosaur closer in form to Hesperornithoides. I think it definitely gets us closer to what the forerunners of birds looked like, but not because Hesperornithoides itself was that animal, Hartman says. Rather, the new fossil indicates that the origin of flying birds may have occurred later than researchers had expected and in a more specific group of dinosaurs. Other experts are not entirely sure about how Hesperornithoides fits into the greater raptor family tree. It may hop to another branch with future analysis, as there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding how closely related these dinosaur species are to one another, Brusatte says. Birds certainly evolved from dinosaurs like Hesperornithoides, but experts have yet to reach a consensus on which species of ancient raptors are closest to this fascinating evolutionary origin story. Maybe Hesperornithoides is the type of animal that birds directly evolved from, Brusatte says, meaning the dinosaur wasnt the ancestor of the first birds but gives us a look at that ancestors body plan. Or perhaps the dinosaur was one of many bird like dinosaurs that are near the origin of avians but not direct ancestors. Debate will continue, Brusatte says, but if birds evolved from a Hesperornithoides like animal, then that means they probably evolved from running, ground living animals. Regardless of the exact phylogenetic position of Hesperornithoides among bird relatives, the discovery of a well preserved specimen from North America that is so close to the ancestry of birds and Jurassic in age is unusual to say the least, Zelenitsky says. Paleontologists will no doubt be fluttering about this dinosaur for years to come."}, {"title": "Fossil of Ancient Bird Three Times Bigger Than an Ostrich Found in Europe ", "author": "Emily Toomey", "date": "June 26, 2019", "doc": "Giant birds of the past have names that speak for themselves. The elephant bird, a native of Madagascar and the largest known giant bird, stood at over nine feet tall and weighed in at a whopping 1,000 pounds or more, until it went extinct about 1,000 years ago. Australias mihirung, nicknamed thunder bird, which disappeared nearly 50,000 years ago, is thought to have been nearly seven feet tall and weighed between 500 and 1,000 pounds. But until now, no one had ever found evidence of these towering avians in Europe. Today, researchers describe the first fossil of a giant bird found in Crimea in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Dated at around 1.8 million years old, the specimen makes experts question previous assumptions that giant birds were not part of the regions fauna when early human ancestors first arrived in Europe. A team of paleontologists dug up the fossilan unusually large femurin Taurida Cave, located on the Crimean Peninsula in the northern Black Sea. The cave was only discovered last June when the construction of a new highway revealed its entrance. Initial expeditions last summer led to exciting finds, including the bones and teeth of extinct mammoth relatives. Of course, the team didnt expect to find large birds, since there had never been evidence of their existence in Europe. When these bones reached me, I felt like I was holding something belonging to elephant birds from Madagascar, paleontologist Nikita Zelenkov of the Borissiak Paleontological Institute, who lead the study, says in an email. This was the most surprising part for me, such an incredible size. We did not expect that. Based on the femurs dimensions, the team calculated that the bird would have weighed around 992 poundsas much as an adult polar bearmaking it the third largest bird ever recorded. Although the bone was similar in size to an elephant birds femur, it was more slender and elongated, like a larger version of the modern ostrich Struthio camelus. The main difference from Struthio is the notable robustness. There are also some less visible details, like the shape or orientation of particular surfaces, which indicate a different morphology from ostriches, Zelenkov says. Based on these distinctions, the team tentatively classified the femur as belonging to the flightless giant bird Pachystruthio dmanisensis. A similar looking femur from the Early Pleistocene was found in Georgia and described in 1990, but at the time, the team didnt calculate the full size of the ancient bird. The femurs shape also gives us clues about what the world was like when Pachystruthio was alive. Its similarities to the bones of a modern ostrich suggest that enormous bird was a good runner, which could imply that it lived among large carnivorous mammals like the giant cheetah or saber toothed cats. This idea is supported by the earlier findings of nearby bones and fossils. Additionally, Pachystruthios immense mass could point to a drier, harsher environment. Previous studies of Australias mihirung suggest that it evolved to be a larger size as the landscape became more arid, since a larger body mass can digest tougher, low nutrition food more efficiently. Pachystruthio may have evolved its large stature for similar reasons. Perhaps most notably, the team hypothesizes that Pachystruthio was present when Homo erectus arrived in Europe during the Early Pleistocene and possibly arrived via the same route. Knowing that the two ancient species could have coexisted introduces a world of new questions for scientists. The thought that some of the largest birds to have ever existed were not found in Europe until so recently is revelatory, Daniel Field, a paleobiologist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the new research, says in an email. It raises exciting questions about the factors that gave rise to these giant birds, and the factors that drove them to extinction. Was their disappearance related to the arrival of human relatives in Europe? Delphine Angst, a paleobiologist at the University of Bristol who was also not involved in the study, says its too early to tell without direct evidence of human life near the same site. For this specific case, its difficult to answer, Angst says. But if you take all the examples we have, like the moas in New Zealand, we have plenty of clear evidence that these birds were hunted by humans. Its completely possible in the future that we will maybe find some evidence, like bones with cutting traces or eggshells with decorations. Theres no information yet for this specific case, but its possible. Despite the lack of a definitive answer, Angst emphasizes that this is an important step toward understanding how these birds evolved and later went extinct.   These giant birds are known in various places in the world for different periods of time, so theyre a very interesting biological group to understand how an environment works, Angst says. Here we have one more specimen and one more giant bird in one more location.  Any new piece is very important to helping us understand the global question. As the fossils discovery continues to challenge previous ideas, its clear that unlike Pachystruthio, this new finding is taking flight."}, {"title": "Pterosaurs May Have Flown as Soon as They Hatched", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "June 13, 2019", "doc": "For baby birds learning how to fly, it takes some practice, positive reinforcement and sometimes a bit of a push. As we know, our feathered friends are survivors of dinosaurs, ironically a terrestrial species that couldnt fly yet called theropods. Instead, pterosaurs were the kings and queens of the sky during the time of the dinosaurs, but these winged reptiles bear no relation to modern birds. Another ability that sets pterosaurs apart could be the ability to fly from the moment they cracked open their shelllittle to no parental involvement needed, according to a new study in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Previous research had concluded that pterosaurs probably learned to fly like todays birds. Observations of prehistoric embryos found that they had poorly developed wings, meaning they likely needed some help from mom or dad until they reached nearly full size. But Cara Giaimo at The New York Times reports the current study had a wealth of new data to analyze that led them to reach the opposite conclusion. In 2017, paleontologists unearthed a pterosaur colony from the species Hamipterus tianshanensis that was covered with mud 100 to 145 million years ago during floods in Jinzhou, China. Not only were there hundreds of fossilized bones from adults and juveniles, there were also 300 ancient eggs, including 16 with embryos at various stages of development. Paleobiologists David Unwin of the University of Leicester and Charles Deeming of the University of Lincoln suspected there were enough samples to accurately chart out the development of pterosaur embryos. Unwin tells The New York Times that previous attempts to map the development process had been kind of ad hoc  just look at it and guess. The duo and their team carefully examined the Jinzhou embryo fossils along with others recently found in China and Argentina. Previous research had assumed that the Jinzhou embryos were all at a similar stage of development. But after analyzing egg size and shape, limb length, and other age markers, they found the embryos were at various stages of developmentfrom freshly laid to close to hatching. They also looked at data from juveniles of nine other pterosaur species as well as modern crocodiles and quails to understand the sequence in which their bones harden. The teams conclusion is that the little pterosaurs, known as flaplings, came out of their shells with the right proportions and strong enough bones to let them take to the skies. The extraordinary thing about those embryos is they have a set of bones that in many respects match those of adults in terms of proportions, Unwin tells Chelsea White at New Scientist. When they come out of the egg, they are like mini adults. One of the strongest pieces of evidence that the pterosaurs were precocious fliers is the fact that their wing boneequivalent to the middle finger in humans and an important bone for flyinghardens very early. In most vertebrates, its one of the last bones to ossify. Its extremely unlikely that they would equip themselves with a flight apparatus if they were not going to use it, Unwin tells Giaimo. What do you need mummy and daddy for if you can do everything yourself? David Martill, paleobiologist at the University of Portsmouth who was not involved in the study, tells Ryan F. Mandelbaum at Gizmodo that the interpretation is solid. That paper was super, he says. If you look at flying animals, even precocious birds, their wing skeletons arent as developed. Bats arent as developed. Pterosaurs, theyre developed with the same aspect ratio of adults. But not everyone thinks the tiny pterosaurs were born air worthy. Kevin Padian, museum curator at the University of California, Berkeley, tells New Scientist that there is an important piece of the flight puzzle missing muscles. He points out that even precocial birds can only support about 10 percent of their own bodyweight right out of the egg. It is quite a stretch to assume that hatchling pterosaurs could support 100 per cent of the body mass in the air, especially with no data on muscle mass of hatchlings, Padian says. Unwin points out that this study makes one thing clear Pterosaurs developed differently than modern birds and bats, making them an imperfect comparison. Its that sheer alienness of pterosaurs that is really fascinating about them, he tells The New York Times Giaimo. These were creatures that were really different than anything thats around today."}, {"title": "Here Are 12 Things You Might Miss in the Smithsonian\u2019s New Fossil Hall ", "author": "Rachael Lallensack", "date": "June 6, 2019", "doc": "Its easy to get caught up gazing at the towering dinosaurs in the new fossil hall at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History, but the story of our planets life history is much more complicated than Tyrannosaurus rex and its cousins.  The exhibition is set up to take visitors on a journey through prehistoric time, hence the halls moniker Deep Time. Covering 4.6 billion years, the show captures what life looked like in the oceans, details how it emerged onto land, and explores all of what life looked like before, during and after the dawn of dinosaurs. The nuance of millions of years of evolution plays out in elaborate works of art, digital displays, tiny dioramas, molds, models and detailed fossils big and small.  Its tough to catch everything the firstor even secondtime around so weve put together a list of things that you might miss, but shouldnt. The scientific practice of recreating the fossilization process is called taphonomy. In the new Deep Time exhibition, you can watch it unfold before your eyes with time lapse imaging of a decomposing lizard. Over the course of a little more than a year, you can see the lizards body bloat up, get devoured by flies and maggots, and eventually disintegrate down to its bare bones. Be sure to move the cursor ever so slowly so you can see a gecko sneak onto the carcass to catch flies for dinner. Featured behind the interactive touch screen video, you can see the fossil of an early synapsid, Ophiacodon uniformis. Replicating the fossilization process helps researchers learn more about the creatures final moments and the earliest stages of fossilization. To tell the story of the history of life, you have to start at the very, very beginning. Before life could inhabit Earth, the planet had to become habitable. On display is a 3.4 billion year old metaconglomerate rock with 4.4 billion year old zircon bits embedded inside it. Minerals in the zircon show a time when Earths oceans, atmosphere and plate tectonics began. At that time, the ingredients for life on Earth were merely microscopic, organic material found in the early oceans. Today, those same materials still exist, but only in harsh environments like hot springs. Adorning several walls of the hall in colorful typeface is the elegant quote From so simple a beginning, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved. It is the last sentence from On the Origin of Species written by the famed English naturalist Charles Darwin. The quote is a unifying theme of the hall and centers around the idea that life on Earth is forever changing, was changing in the past and will change again. Thats also why a bronze statue of Charles Darwin sits at the center of the exhibition. With his notebook in hand, the sculpture of Darwin is seated on a bench, as if hes just exhausted himself touring the show. Sit down beside him and take a look at the open page of his journal. There youll find recreated his first ever sketch that he made of his tree of life. With ancient creatures branching off to modern day animals, this was the catalytic moment when Darwin realized with all certainty that all plants and animals are related. At the top of the journal page, Darwin wrote with great authority I think. Another curiosity? The bird on Darwins shoulder is in fact a finch, the species he studied to illustrate his theory of evolution. The hall is set up to take you through time. Right around the exhibitions entrance, you can find displays featuring early humans. By around 13,000 years ago, our ancestors were on every continent, sharing the Ice Age era Earth with megafauna like the mastodon. A bronze statue of Homo sapiens appears pathetically diminutive against the massive mastodon skeleton, but if you look closely at the intricate artwork behind the mastodon, on the wall, you will find one of our ancient cousins peering out from the brush at the great beast. During the Cretaceous period, flowering plants started to take root and dinosaurs lived in a brilliantly biodiverse ecosystem. Right next to T. rex devouring a Triceratops, theres an illustration of a dinosaur footprint filled with water. In the tiny pool, swims a frog and a salamander. By collecting microfossils, or super small skeletal remains, at dig sites, researchers know that prehistoric amphibians shared the ecosystems that dinosaurs inhabited. A teeny prehistoric salamander jaw in the nearby display case dates to the age of the dinos. These are critical tools in the study of dinosaurs, the display text points out, quoting the museums curator of dinosaurs Matthew Carrano. Im especially interested in finding small fossils from many different species, so I can understand more about the whole ecosystem. A lot of times when researchers find the remains of an ancient organism, they have to work backward to figure out exactly what it was. That process can get really tricky if they only have one or two fossilized body parts to go off of. Thats the case with Steropodon galmani, or what researchers suspect is an early mammal. Because they dont have all the details filled in, they decided to display it as a work in progress. We may not know much about what Steropodon galmani looked like, but we do know that many early mammals did something theyre modern counterparts cant lay eggs. Youll notice the pixelated rat like statue is guarding a nest. A major goal for the team behind the new exhibition was making sure the displays were as realistic as possible. That meant major innovations when it came to how to pose the skeletons and how to provide more context about the environment the animals inhabited. And that meant making things a little messier. Earth wasnt a completely pristine, luscious utopia before humans came along and life has always been a little dirty. When putting the final touches on the diorama models together, Smithsonian researchers noticed something was missing poop. Look closely at these tiny worlds and yep, your eyes dont deceive you. Those are poo piles. Ever wonder what T. rex poop looked like? It might not be the most glamorous feature of the hall, but researchers learn a lot about diet and habitat from fossilized excrement, or coprolites as theyre technically called, like T. rexs. In this particular coprolite cast, paleontologists found crushed, undigested bone. That tells researchers that T. rex chewed its food, rather than swallowing it whole. You can read all about it in a strategically placed location on the walls as you wait in line for the bathroom. One of the coolest features that modern insects have evolved is the creative ways that they blend into their surroundings using physical camouflage. If you look closely, youll see a prehistoric bug, the Scorpionfly, Juracimbrophlebia ginkofolia, next to an early Ginkgo tree relative, Yimaia capituliformis. Both are estimated to exist between 157 to 161 million years ago. You can also catch early evidence of eyespots on the wings of a Kalligramma lacewing butterfly. Scientists suspect eyespots first evolved in Jurassic lacewings and then a second time in modern butterflies. This fossil might have you seeing double A massive prehistoric fish, Xiphactinus audax, devoured a still impressively large, Thryptodus zitteli. Both then met their fate and became fossilized in incredible detail. These two teleosts, or relatives of bony tongues fish, lived between 89 and 90 million years ago. Nearby youll even see three animals and two meals in one fossil. A mosasaur, specifically Tylosaurus proriger, ate a Plesiosaur as evidenced by bones found within the mosasaurs stomach. Thats not all The Plesiosaur also seemed to have a recent dinner, and researchers found smaller bones from a third unknown species in its stomach. All three were fossilized in a Russian nesting doll of last meals, you could say. The new fossil hall isnt just about dinosaursyoull find fossils of plants, insects and more, too. Its all part of the overarching story the researchers behind the exhibition are trying to tell that everything on our planet is interconnected and always changing. Yes, fossils of tropical plantsand even crocodilescan be found in Alaska. About 60 million years ago, Alaska was covered in dense, wet forest. The estimated 50 million  to 57 million year old giant palm leaf poised above other rainforest foliage was found in whats now Petersburg Borough, Alaska. Sure, Earths climate may have been much warmer than it is today, but that doesnt mean we can relax and kick back. As several displays in the hall explain, todays climate change is happening at an extremely fast pace and humans are the cause. And just because climate change has happened before doesnt mean we humans will survive it, which is why there is a section of the hall dedicated to solutions. The history of Earth and all life on it is also our history. Our actions matter and what we do has an immense effect on the planet. As the exhibition explains, the human population is three times larger than it was in 1950 and we use five times as much energy. Along the wall, screens display videos about climate change solutions happening in communities around the world. Behind those, youll notice that the wall paper is covered with birds eye view photos of people that gradually get more numerous and densely spaced from the right side of the wall to the left. Thats not just a cool design element its a precise depiction of how the human population has grown rapidly over time. But it conveys a message of hope We are causing rapid, unprecedented change to our planet. But there is hopewe can adapt, innovate, and collaborate to leave a positive legacy.

Foster and his family spent hours a day searching for a glimmer of rainbow shaded gems embedded in the rocks 40 feet underground. But all they found were a bunch of dinosaur bones. We would see these things that looked like horses, says Foster. Then we would just smash them up to see if there were any opals inside. But there was something strange about the growing collection of bones accumulating in Fosters living room. Piling the bones into two suitcases, Foster took a 450 mile train ride to the Australian Museum in Sydney. When museum curator Alex Ritchie examined Fosters bone collection dumped on his desk, he recognized them for what they were and knew immediately that an expedition to the opal miners site, called the Sheepyard, was in order. The excavation team wasnt disappointed. In 1984, they hauled out the most complete dinosaur skeleton ever found in New South Wales. The bones, which were encrusted with sparkling opal, were taken back to the Australian Museum for public display. Two decades later, Foster took the fossils back and donated them to the Australian Opal Centre in Lightning Ridge. While the stunning fossils had been seen by plenty of museum visitors, no one had formally studied them. Now, researchers have finally taken a closer look at what was uncovered near Fosters family home 35 years ago. The findings, published today in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, reveal a new species, the first fossil evidence of a dinosaur herd in Australia, and the most complete opalized dinosaur skeleton in the world. This is unheard of in Australia, says Phil Bell, the studys lead author and paleontologist at the University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales. There were around 60 odd bones in the entire collection, which is a remarkable number for an Australian dinosaur. The glittering remains, encrusted with opal, represent the newly described species Fostoria dhimbangunmal. The species is the youngest Australian member of the iguanodontian dinosaurs, a plant eating group that had a horse shaped skull and a similar build to the kangaroo. The United Kingdoms Iguanodon and Australias Muttaburrasaurus are among Fostorias more famous cousins. The name of the new dinosaur is a nod to its original discoverer, with dhimbangunmal meaning sheep yard in the Yuwaalaraay, Yuwaalayaay and Gamilaraay languages of the Indigenous people living in the area near Lightening Ridge. Compared to China and North America, Australia is hardly regarded as a prehistoric hotspot for dinosaur hunters. Over the past century, just 10 species of dinosaur have been discovered in Australia, including the three toed Australovenator and the long necked Wintonotitan and Diamantinasaurus, which were discovered in Queensland last year. Lightning Ridge, one of the richest sources of opal in the world, is the only site in New South Wales where dinosaur bones have been found. Since the 1930s, opal miners like Foster have dug up 100 million year old bone and tooth fragments by accident. One such discovery, an opalized jawbone discovered by Bell in late 2018, turned out to be a new dog sized dinosaur species called Weewarrasaurus pobeni. The discovery of dinosaur groups unique to the southern hemisphere suggests that our current understanding of dinosaur evolution is incomplete, says Ralph Molnar, a paleontologist at Museum of Northern Arizona in Flagstaff. Australian dinosaurs are globally important, and as more discoveries are made, they will play an increasingly significant role in our understanding of that time. When Bell first laid eyes on the pile of fragments, he assumed that they all came from one animal. Hours of CT scanning at the local radiology clinic revealed large fragments of backbone, skull, limb, foot and hip. But something about the massive collection didnt add up. There were all these duplicates, and we couldnt stick the bones together to make a full skeleton, Bell says. What really hit it off was when we realized that we had four shoulder blades, all of different sizes. There was only one explanation Each shoulder blade belonged to a separate individual. The largest shoulder blade likely belonged to an adult, while the three smaller pieces were from juvenile dinosaurs. The four skeleton remains suggest that Fostoria, which lacked big claws and sharp teeth, stuck together in herds or family groups to protect themselves from predators. Aside from trackways of dinosaur footprints in Queensland and Western Australia, there had been no other fossil evidence of dinosaur herds found in the country until now. Fostorias flat teeth indicate that the animals fed on plants and foraged on two legs. Bell says that the 16 foot dinosaurs were quite plain to look at, with no extravagant horns or crests. The land these dinosaurs roamed around 100 million years ago in the mid Cretaceous was much different than the dry, shrubby scenery of Lightning Ridge today. While Australia was part of Gondwanalandthe supercontinent that included South America, Africa, Antarctica and Indiathe historic mining town was located 60 degrees south of where it is today, making its climate more mild than current temperatures. The parched land in the area was once dotted with rivers, lagoons and floodplains that cut through lush vegetation. The layers of sediment that buried ancient plants and animals were rich in silica, a building block of sand. Over time, this silica seeped into cracks and holes in fossils, eventually forming opal in dead animals such as snails, fish, turtles, bird and mammals. While Fostorias appearance may have been plain while it was alive, the opalized fossils it left behind now shimmer with streaks of green and deep blue. Bell hopes the findings shine a spotlight on Australias dinosaur diversity, which will help paleontologists uncover clues about the Gondwanan environment and the plants and animals that inhabited the prehistoric continent. While extensive research on South Americas paleontological history has revealed insights about the western half of Gondwanaland, the eastern side continues to be shrouded in mystery. With Antarctica blanketed in ice and most of the New Zealand continent underwater, sites like Lightning Ridge are key to unravelling the southern hemispheres ancient past. Australia absolutely did have dinosaurs, and they were totally different and exciting, Bell says. They are just not in text books, but were going to change that."}, {"title": "How Do Paleontologists Find Fossils?", "author": "Hans-Dieter Sues", "date": "June 3, 2019", "doc": "In Thomas Hardys 1873 novel A Pair of Blue Eyes, Henry Knight tries to impress the heroine, Elfride Swancourt, by showing her how air currents rise up a steep sea cliff. A sudden gust carries off his hat and, attempting to catch it, he slips down the incline. Knight ends up clinging to the cliff for dear life. Being of a scientific bent, he studies the cliff face even in this dire situation. By one of those familiar conjunctions of things wherewith the inanimate world baits the mind of man when he pauses in suspense, opposite Knights eyes was an imbedded fossil, standing forth in low relief from the rock. It was a creature with eyes. The eyes, dead and turned to stone, were even now regarding him. It was one of the early crustaceans called Trilobites. With more than 15,000 recorded species, trilobites were a fantastically diverse group of arthropods that roamed the oceans from about 540 million to 252 million years ago. Considered relatives of crustaceans in Hardys day, they are now interpreted as an entirely extinct evolutionary radiation of early arthropods. Arthropods are characterized by pairs of jointed legs and a segmented exoskeleton. Today, they account for more than 80 percent of animal species and include insects, spiders, crabs and their many relatives.  About a century after Hardy penned his novel, I sat at an exposure of shale along the edge of a dark wood in Germany. I was a high school student traveling with fellow collectors and looking for fossils from the Devonian Period, 358 million years to 419 million years ago. I kept splitting blocks of shale to look for fossils buried within them. With a slight tap of my rock hammer, a piece of rock parted to reveal the head shield of a trilobite. The fossil stared back at me with its sightless eyes while I marveled at the fact that I was the very first human to see it after it had spent some 390 million years in the ground. The imperiled Mr. Knight accidentally came face to face with a trilobite. By contrast, I did so after studying geological maps. I knew the age of the shale and I had a pretty good idea of the kinds of extinct animals I might find. The two stories nicely illustrate the two most common ways of finding fossils.  Collecting does not require formal training. Indeed, some of the finest collectors I have hunted fossils with include a policeman and a veterinarian. Many people collect fossils because they are tangible mementos of Earths unimaginably long history. The fantastic shapes of certain fossils make them objects of aesthetic pleasure to other collectors. Many fossils are discovered by sheer accident. In 1906, a German prospector in present day Tanzania came across a huge bone weathering out of the ground in a forest. This find led to the discovery of one of the largest dinosaur graveyards in the world. In 2002, an Italian marble cutter discovered the skeleton of an early whale inside a large block of 40 million year old marblized limestone from Egypt while slicing the rock into slabs for architectural use. Just recently, scientists recognized a piece of a mandible found by a monk in a cave in Tibet as the first good record of an as yet mysterious species of ancient humans. The monk had entered the cave to find a quiet place to pray when he noticed the bone on the cave floor. Although there is always a major element of luck in finding fossils, professional paleontologists and experienced avocational collectors do not leave things to chance. The careful study of geological maps helps to identify suitable areas for prospecting. Fossils occur in sedimentary rocks, which were deposited by wind or water. By contrast, igneous rocks, which formed from hot molten material that would burn any biological life, do not contain fossils. My own research focuses on vertebrate fossils from the Triassic Period, 252 million years to 200 million years ago. Worldwide, there are only a few dozen places with rocks that could potentially contain such remains. Here in the populated eastern seaboard of the United States, most of the rock formations from the Triassic are covered by buildings, parking lots or dense vegetation.  Sites for prospecting are largely restricted to roadcuts, construction sites and quarries. An important site in central Virginia that I excavated many years ago is now buried beneath a school football field. By contrast, the colorful arid lands of the American Southwest are the stuff of paleontologists dreams. There, you can collect lots of fossils without having to worry about being obliterated by vehicles passing inches away. Looking for fossils takes patience and perseverance. Sometimes you spend days or weeks in the field before finally making an interesting find. Some rock layers just dont have that many fossils. I have collected fossils of Triassic vertebrates along the shores of the Bay of Fundy in eastern Canada, where on average, I find only three or four pieces of bone per mile of shoreline. Most of these are so incomplete it is impossible to tell what bone they are, much less which animal they came from. Even so, over the many years searching the area, other collectors and I have assembled a sizeable collection of fossilsmany of them species new to science. Some collectors have a real knack for finding fossils even where they are rare. Others bring great enthusiasm but will literally step on fossils without seeing or recognizing them. Success heavily depends on quickly learning how to distinguish fossils in a particular type of rock. When I first started collecting along the shores of the Bay of Fundy it took some time before I was able to tell cross sections of white bones on surfaces of red sandstone from similar looking mineral inclusions and bird droppings. My tool kit for fossil hunting contains rock hammers, chisels, protective glasses, a loupe, my notebook, various kinds of glue, and packing material and crates. Before visiting a place with exposures of rocks that I want to study, I am careful to obtain permission from the land owner. Unless collecting is done merely for mementos, it is extremely important to record details about the fossil sites and their exact location. When first uncovered, fossils are often fragile and must be stabilized with glue. Then each find is carefully wrapped and labeled before being taken to a lab or to the museum. One material that is most popular and works splendidly for wrapping small fossils is toilet paper. Large specimens often require protective jackets made of plaster bandages similar to those used by medical doctors to stabilize broken bones. In over 40 years I have worked the rocks, searching them for finds that might bring still more knowledge of what roamed this planet millions and millions of years ago, I have probably pulled thousands of fossils from the ground. Ive never lost the wonder. To be the first human to find and touch an extinct creature is a singular moment that cannot be easily put into words. These old stones, give them a voice and what a tale theyd tell, wrote Aeschylus in the ancient Greek play Agamemnon. I shall never tire of listening to those tales."}, {"title": "Amid All the Fossils, Smithsonian\u2019s New Dinosaur Exhibition Tells the Complex Story of Life", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "June 3, 2019", "doc": "Time runs through everything. It is not simply a matter of setting an alarm to wake up for work, agreeing on when to meet a friend, or how many years weve spent on the planet. Time is what connects our present moment to every other that has come before, allowing us to delve into the past to assemble some understanding of how our current moment came to beand what might yet happen. Paleontology, the study of ancient life, is one of the intellectual time machines that humanity uses to investigate and understand natures big picture. The National Museum of Natural History has embraced the science since the museums inception, from the days when Hatcher the Triceratops graced the museums early Hall of Extinct Monsters until the beginning of the 21st century, when the museum decided to close its much loved dinosaur hall for a lengthy renovation and refresh of the science. Towering dinosaurs, early amphibians, ancient elephants, and more all gave testament to the strange times and places they once inhabited in Earth history. But now, after years being reconsidered and reshuffled, those familiar prehistoric fossils come back to us to tell a different story. Theyve come to tell us of our connection to Deep Time. Fossils are often treated as tattered remnants of lost worlds, of times vastly different from our own inhabited by bizarre beings with little connection to our modern Earth. But in planning and designing what the new Smithsonian exhibition Hall of FossilsDeep Time should look like, the museums paleontologists and exhibit specialists had something different in mind. Each fossil represents a story that joins a grander narrative of lifes epic historyfrom the rise of the first organisms through the parade of majestic prehistoric creatures and beyond, to the future. The question we asked ourselves when we started this, is What things about paleontology are different now than the last time the hall was renovated? says Smithsonian paleobotanist Scott Wing. The science had undergone an incredible growth spurt over the past several decades, moving far beyond the stereotype of simply collecting and cataloging old bones to a field that considers Earth systems, ecology, and the connections between life of different ages. Its not only changed how we study things, Wing says, but why we study them. Any fossilno matter how mundane or spectacularis part of multiple stories of lifes evolution and how organisms responded to their constantly changing environments. We now study the fossil record because it helps us understand the processes by which the Earth and life changed through time, Wing says, and being geologic scale changers of the environment ourselves, we need to know how those things work and how were changing them now. The question was how to tell that story while working in the existing exhibition space. The biggest challenge is how do you tell 3.7 billion years of lifes story in one spacebut also make it meaningful and relevant to a visitor in 2019? says museum exhibits specialist Siobhan Starrs. The first step was starting with the flow of the tale. The traditional story of life on Earth often starts with the beginning, around 3.7 billion years ago, from there winding up through time to show the evolutionary connections and transformations that altered the shape of nature. Deep Time deconstructs that narrative, starting with the present and moving backward, following connections from our own time deeper and deeper into the past. Smithsonian Dinosaurs and Other Amazing Creatures from Deep Time presents some of Earths strangest and most unusual creatures from as early as 3.8 billion years ago. Beginning with the first evidence of life, it moves through periods of biodiversity and mass extinction and into a look at the first dinosaurs, mammals, pterosaurs, and other fauna and flora from the Archean to the Quarternary eras.  The journey starts even before visitors set foot into the new hall. Henry, the museums storied bull elephant in the rotunda, is an iconic, imperiled species in our own time. But as soon as visitors step into the new hall, theyre welcomed by a trumpeting American mastodona connection to the Ice Age world of not so very long ago, which began a paltry 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago. Picking up the timeline from there, the exhibition journeys back through the 40 million year old hothouse world of the Eocene, the heyday of giant Jurassic dinosaurs 150 million years ago, and the catastrophe at the end of the Permian, 252 million years ago, that wiped out about 75 percent of life on Earthand beyond. Naturally, some of the museums huge, charismatic megafauna determined the flow of the story. Tyrannosaurus, Camarasaurus, Diplodocus and many more dinosaurian friends all still inhabit the hall, but their sheer size Diplodocus measures 90 feet long required a great deal of space, especially because the museum decided to mount them dramatically, in ways that have never been done before. As intricate and structurally beautiful as most museum dinosaur mounts might be, many are typically staged in relatively static poses or in displays that reinforce the old stereotype that dinosaurs were snarling monsters of distant epochs. In the Smithsonians new hall, while there is certainly Mesozoic dramalike T. rex readying to tear the head off Triceratopsa little time spent among the titans in their new displays will reveal other facets of their day to day lives that help place them in the broader context of lifes ever changing story. Life is messy, Starrs says, and the exhibit designers thought hard about how dinosaurs left a footprint on their environmentsboth literally and figuratively. A Torosaurus, similar to Triceratops, wanders through a Cretaceous forest in a new mural, breaking twigs as it goes. A dome headed dinosaur called Stegoceras scratches its nose. A brooding Allosaurus curls its tail around its nest. A hungry Camarasaurus rears up to munch on Jurassic branches. On a personal level, this was closest to my heart, says Smithsonian dinosaur curator Matthew Carrano, trying to make these animals seem like they were once real animals and doing something real animals do. An intense amount of work was required to come up with these new displays, and the behind the scenes efforts have already started to fuel new scientific research. Some of the dinosaurs from the old fossil hall were still partly encased in the rock from their original excavation in the late 1800s. The old exhibits not only had to be dismantled, but some of the dinosaurs had to be prepared anew, revealing information that was previously hidden. The museums extraordinary skeleton of the Jurassic meat eating dinosaur Ceratosaurus, for example, included hand bones that had never been fully described before and were recently studied by Carrano. Starrs notes that research into how visitors interact with exhibits and social science was part of the planning as well, in an effort to make the exhibits as interesting and accessible to as many people as possible. And, following the powerful thread of climate change through time, Wing notes that a specialized conference was carried out over the course of several days to come up with the clearest look at climate shifts through time. The meeting is leading to new approaches in tracking how our world has changed. Deep Time is the culmination of hundreds of years of work by innumerable scientists and community members, from the Smithsonians own experts and curators to the 19th century fossil hunters who dug some of these specimens out of the ground. And what comes together is an integrated view of life where distinct stories become bundled together into the flow of times grand narrative. Visitors will pick up on the fact that things are changing through time, ecosystems are changing as well as animals, and its an interconnected system from the beginning of life to the future, says Smithsonian vertebrate paleontology curator Anna Kay Behrensmeyer.   But what will that future look like? Deep Time doesnt simply stop with the Ice Age, or consider humans outside of the rest of nature. To the contrary, the exhibition drives home the point that the choices we makefrom the broader cultural use of fossil fuels to power our lives to the development or conservation of landscapeshave dramatic and increasingly dire impacts on our world. This is where Deep Times message truly hits home, because its only by looking to the past that we can plan for the future. About 50 million years ago, for example, the Earth went through a natural temperature spike comparable to what humans are creating today with the use of fossil fuels. The complex story of how animal and plant life responded is a preview of what might transpire if we continue on our present course. The importance of the ecological turning point we now stand at is on full display, not only showing visitors how were shaping our legacy but also asking them what is worth protecting and how people just like them are starting to make changes. We still have a choice, Behrensmeyer says. What we do next will leave its mark on the planet just as surely as the life of any dinosaurs. Everyone receives a legacy from previous generations and gives one to the next. Whats your legacy going to be? Wing asks.  Connection runs through Deep Time. There are the connections between prehistoric organismswhether its photosynthesizing bacteria, part of a prehistoric reef, a dinosaur, an ancient mammal or a tree that made up part of an Eocene forestbut there is also our own connection to the past. Everything on display in the exhibition, every fossil, has some relevance to the world we live in today. Im hoping visitors walk in expecting a dinosaur hall and they walk away with something much bigger than that, Starrs says, with the concept that this story has meaning and relevance to meto all of usright now. Humans are not the endpoint or goal of this story. Life will go on with or without us, Behrensmeyer notes. But we are not isolated from the evolutionary and environmental phenomena that have so dramatically shaped all these forms of life over millions and millions of years. Whats unprecedented is that our species can make choices about whats to come. We should try to keep ecosystems as strong as possible so that we can find a future that has a lot of elements that we like about the present, Behrensmeyer says. Theres something wondrous about that. Not only are we uncovering these stories in paleontologys vibrant Renaissance era, but we are inextricably intertwined with the past lives we wish to understand. Or, as Carrano succinctly puts it, Were part of this story just like everything else.

Rex\u2019 Prepares to Make Its Smithsonian Debut", "author": "Paige Williams", "date": "June 2019", "doc": "Nearly nine million or so plant and animal species inhabit our planet, about 1.8 million cataloged under the binomial system devised by the 18th century Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus. Their Latin and Greek names have had plenty of time to lodge in our collective consciousness, but most have never taken hold. Felis catus remains a house cat, Drosophila melanogaster a fruit fly. We humans often cant even accurately cite our own speciesHomo sapiens, with the final s. The one exception, whose scientific handle everyone gets right, is Tyrannosaurus rex, a marauding theropod thats been dead for over 65 million years. Tyrannosaurus is a mashup of the Greek words for tyrant and lizard rex, in Latin, means king. Larger and potentially more fearsome life forms have existed, but the tyrant lizard king manages to dazzle us like no other. Why? I tried to answer this question when reporting and writing my recent book, The Dinosaur Artist, a true story about international fossil smuggling and the scientific consequences of the bone trade. At the center of that account was a specimen from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia a Tarbosaurus bataar, the Asian cousin of T. rex. They were so similar, they couldve been twins. Whenever I asked people why theyre so captivated by rex and its kind, they usually replied with some version of It was a real life monster. Tyrannosaurus rex stood some 40 feet long and at least 12 feet tall, and weighed up to 15,500 pounds. It would have looked almost puny, however, next to a plant eating behemoth like 105 foot long Diplodocus. The awe surrounding T. rex owes to the apex predators imagined ferocity. Its serrated teeth are continually compared to bananas in size. Its head was as large as a bathtub. Its curved claws would have shredded other animals.    Fossils are portals to what geologists and paleontologists call deep time. To hold a Tyrannosaurus tooth in the palm of your hand, or to encounter a skeleton up close, is to come into contact with tangible evidence of earths distant past. That immediate connection with prehistory is on display in dramatic fashion at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural Historys new 31,000 square foot fossil hall. Holding pride of place is the reinstalled, 15 foot tall T. rex skeleton, on long term loan from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. T. rex lived during the Cretaceous, the geological period that ended when an asteroid strike wiped out the terrestrial dinosaurs. The first partial skeleton was discovered in 1902 by legendary fossil hunter Barnum Brown, a native Kansan. Brown found the remains in the Hell Creek Formation, a rich bone bed that runs through eastern Montana and into South Dakota. By 1988, only nine mostly complete T. rex skeletons had been located, anywhere. Seven had come from Montana. On Labor Day weekend that year, rancher Kathy Wankel, who enjoyed bone hunting in the Hell Creek with her family, spotted a fossil embedded in the dirt near Montanas Fort Peck Reservoir. She and her husband, Tom, tried prying it out of the earth, which had baked hard, like concrete, during the dry summer. The Wankels were able to extract part of a shoulder blade and arm. They took the fossils to the Museum of the Rockies, in Bozeman, where the paleontologist Jack Horner recognized them as correlating to Tyrannosaurus rex. The museum dug out the skeleton, discovering it to be 85 percent intacta remarkable percentage. Not only thatWankel had unearthed a specimen that contained the first complete T. rex forelimb known to science. Because the interior of rex bones can be read like tree rings, paleontologists determined that this particular dinosaur was about 18 when it died, ten years short of the species estimated life span. The Wankel T. rex at first was displayed in Bozeman. The federal government owns it because the bones came from lands controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. In 2013, the Smithsonian arranged for the skeleton to be displayed for the next 50 years in the National Museum of Natural History, as the centerpiece of its soaring new fossil hall. Forty feet long, the skeleton is shown ripping the head off a hapless Triceratops. Its new name The Nations T. rex.

Im sorry if it sounds like Im inside a bathroom, Gary Staab said on his cellphone. The tail was part of a 52 foot long, life size model of the prehistoric shark that Staab was custom building for the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. The mighty megalodon, terror of the ancient oceans, could grow to 60 feet long, with a mouth stretching more than 9 feet wide and a bite force stronger than any other creature ever, living or dead. The violent damage it caused to its prey, and the rows of serrated teeth, have given the shark the reputation of an enormous prehistoric Jawsa great white on steroids, says Hans Sues, chair of paleobiology at the museum. In fact, Sues says, evidence suggests that megalodons, which lived between 23 million and 3.6 million years ago, were more closely related to modern mako sharks than to great whites, giving them more slender bodies than great whites and a bronzy back befitting a predator that preferred coastal waters. Plentiful megalodon teeth and a number of calcified vertebrae have been found in ancient seafloors that are now exposedin the cliffs along the Chesapeake Bay, for example. Those fossils were all Staab was going to get Like modern sharks, the megalodons skeleton was made from cartilage, which decomposes. So to design the model, he and his museum collaborators used a formula that extrapolates from tooth length and the body geometry of modern relatives, and found that his shark would be 24 feet across the front fins. Thats the size of a Cessna, he told me. To bring the shark to life, Staab then hand sculpted a detailed, six foot long clay model, laser scanned the sculpture and milled 386 foam pieces that, when assembled, became a full scale prototype the foam itself being too flammable for museum display. Next he fabricated 21 fiberglass panels on top of that, with interior ribs that aligned and bolted together. In April, the model was broken down and trucked from Staabs studio in Kearney, Missouri, to Washington, D.C. On the museum floor, Staab reassembled the behemoth from the inside before crawling out a section in the tail. The shark was touched up with epoxy and fresh paint and raised 85 feet in the air to hang, menacingly, above museum visitors dining in a new caf\u00e9. My job is to not have a style, he said, but rather to be the animalto make that thing as believable as possible.

Soft tissues like feathers and fur are rarely preserved in the fossil record  and when these substances are found, their hues have long since disappeared. But an international team of researchers led by experts at the University of Manchester recently made an important breakthrough in figuring out the colors of prehistoric animals, as Gretchen Vogel reports for Science. Using a non invasive technique, the researchers were able to determine that a three million year old mouse had reddish fur, marking the first time that chemical traces of a red pigment have been detected in an ancient fossil. The study was based on two exceptionally well preserved fossils of a little rodent  formally known as Apodemus atavus, but the researchers dubbed it mighty mouse discovered in Germany. What we found is that the mouse is preserved in absolutely stunning detail, nearly all of the skeleton and most of the soft tissue of the body, head, feet, and tail can easily be recognized, Uwe Bergmann, study co author and physicist at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, tells CNNs Ashley Strickland. To learn more about the mouses coloring, scientists looked to melanin, an important pigment dictating color in ancient and modern animals. There are two main melanin pigments in animal tissues eumelanin, which imparts a black, brown or grey color, and pheomelanin, which is responsible for pink and red hues. Until recently, investigations into the colors of prehistoric creatures have focused on detecting the chemical residues of eumelanin, but pheomelanin proved trickier to find because it is much less stable over geological time. But in 2016, a study led by SLAC paleontologist Nick Edwards showed that it was possible to map the elements that make up red and black pigments in the feathers of modern birds using x ray technology. For instance, the researchers found that zinc bonded to sulphur in a specific way was indicative of red hued pheomelanin. And zinc in the absence of sulphur was a reliable indicator of black eumelanin. We had to build up a strong foundation using modern animal tissue before we could apply the technique to these ancient animals, Edwards explains. It was really a tipping point in using chemical signatures to crack the coloring of ancient animals with soft tissue fossils. For the new study, published in Nature Communications, scientists pelted the mighty mouse fossils with intense x rays to see how they interacted with trace metals preserved in the animals fur. And the team could see that these metals were bonded to organic chemicals in the same way that they bond to organic chemicals in extant animals with red pigments in their tissue. The researchers also discovered that while the fur on the mouses back and sides was red, its belly was white. Where once we saw simply minerals, now we gently unpick the biochemical ghosts of long extinct species, says Phil Manning, the studys first author and professor of natural history at the University of Manchester. Crucially, and in contrast to other types of chemical analyses, the researchers methods did not require them to take a sample from the fossils, which inevitably would have damaged them. And the study authors anticipate that their findings will help experts paint a more vivid picture of other extinct animals.  We understand now what to look for in the future, explains Roy Wogelius, study co author and geochemist at the University of Manchester. And our hope is that these results will mean that we can become more confident in reconstructing extinct animals and thereby add another dimension to the study of evolution."}, {"title": "The Colors of Dinosaurs Open a New Window to Study the Past", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "May 21, 2019", "doc": "On December 9, 1833, the English fossil collector Elizabeth Philpot sent a letter to naturalist William Buckland. In addition to requesting back some vertebrae of a marine reptile Buckland had borrowed, Philpot also included notes on a recent trip with a young upstart fossil houndthe pioneering paleontologist Mary Anning. But what made the note special was an illustration Philpot had included with the letter. It depicted the toothy smile of an Ichthyosaurus skull, drawn after one of the many such fossils that Philpot, her sisters and Anning were finding in the ancient rocks of Englands southern coast. And it wasnt drawn in any ordinary ink. The sepia tones were made from the preserved ink of a squid like creature found in the same deposits as the ichthyosaur, revitalized after 200 million years. On the surface, Philpots drawing might only seem to be a neat fossiliferous trick. In 2009, another drawing made from ancient ink kicked up renewed attention for the surprising fact that traces of prehistoric color could persist to the 21st century. But the fact that such primordial shades can be recovered at all opens up a realm of scientific possibility. With the right specimens, experts can start to color in the fossil record. Sometimes ancient hues can be seen with the naked eye. Researchers have known about fossil insect color patterns and mollusk color patterns all the way back to the Victorian era, says University of Bristol paleobiologist Jakob Vinther. But its the possibility of unlocking the colors of dinosaurs that has captured the imagination of experts and the public alike. For almost the entire history of paleontology, there was no way to tell what hues dinosaurs actually wore. Perhaps, in exceptional circumstances, a fossil might preserve some soft tissues showing patches of light and dark skin or striped plumage, but the actual, in life coloration of the animal was long thought to be beyond the reach of detection. Yet discoveries like Philpots use of very old ink indicated that whispers of color might survive after all. Thanks to a combination of delicate preservation and advanced imaging technology, allowing researchers to see the microscopic details of fossils, paleontologists are learning more than ever about the Mesozoic palette. The biological key to solving the coloration puzzle comes down to miniscule structures called melanosomes. These are tiny, blobby organelles that contain pigment, or melanin, and are present in soft tissues such as skin, scales, and feathers. And while these details were often cast aside as fossil bacteria in decades past, renewed efforts in the 21st century have been able to find the relationship between these tiny structures and colors. A fossil similar to the one that inspired Philpots art set Vinther, now at the University of Bristol, on the trail of fossil colors in 2006. The ink sac of a fossil squid Vinther studied contained melanosomes after 200 million years. And if they could be found in squid ink, why not other fossils, like feathers? An analysis by Vinther and colleagues of a Cretaceous feather found in Brazil opened up the possibility, leaving the researchers to conclude, The discovery of preserved melanosomes opens up the possibility of interpreting the colour of extinct birds and other dinosaurs. Pulling color from the past requires a combination of lucky finds with advanced imaging techniques, says Virginia Tech paleontologist Caitlin Colleary. First, paleontologists need a fossil which is likely to have preserved melanina fossil not just with bones, but feathers, skin or hair. These fossils often contain both melanosomes as well as chemically degraded melanin pigment, and when paleontologists find such a fossil, then they can use modern technology to take a closer look. You start by looking for the microbodies using instruments like scanning electron microscopes, Colleary says. Once those characteristic shapes turn up, chemical analysis can confirm the presence of melanin pigment. This was particularly critical early on in fossil melanin studies because there was still some doubt that the microbodies were in fact melanosomes and not other similar structures, like bacteria, Colleary says. From there, comparisons of the physical and chemical signatures of the melanosomes and melanin can be compared to those of living animals, for which color is known, to reconstruct the look of creatures long dead. When paleontologists announced the discovery of the feathered dinosaur Anchiornis in 2009, the preserved plumage surrounding the skeleton was a dark, carbon colored shade. But analysis of another Anchiornis fossil carried out by Vinther and colleagues the following year revealed a striking color pattern that had previously been invisible. The distribution and details of the preserved melanosomes indicated that Anchiornis was covered in feathers of black and whitenot dissimilar from a magpiewith a splash of red feathers on the top of its head. For the first time, a dinosaur had been fully restored in living color. One by one, other dinosaurs started to show their true colors. The week before the Anchiornis paper came out, the small, fuzzy dinosaur Sinosauropteryx was shown to have a vibrant, red and white banded tail. In 2012, the stacked arrangement of melanosomes found in the feathers of four winged dinosaur Microraptor was shown to create an iridescent sheen similar to that of a modern raven. Avian dinosaurs joined the list, too, with giant fossil penguins bearing color patterns of black, red and gray. And while early studies focused on feathers, paleontologists soon found that melanosomes can reveal the hues of scaly dinosaurs, too. The beaky, horned dinosaur Psittacosaurus was countershaded dark above and light below to help with camouflage, and the immense armored dinosaur Borealopelta sported reddish brown tones. Naturally, there are some limits to this approach. The first is that bones alone are of no help. There must be some sort of preserved soft tissue, such as feathers or skin. Impressions wont do. You need organic residues, Vinther says. The prehistoric animal had to be buried so quickly and preserved in such detail that the remains of the animals actual tissues are preserved. And not all coloration in animals is created by melanosomes. Some colors, like yellows and blues, are created by biochemicals that paleontologists have yet to detect in fossils. The current methodology wont work for every dinosaur, or every color. But the good news is that the approach is creating at least a partial picture. What the colors meant to the animals themselves is another matter. In the case Borealopelta, for examplewith a pattern of rusty red on top, light on bottomthe shading might have been a way for the low slung dinosaur to hide from the ravenous tyrannosaurs of the time. Other dinosaurs were flashier. The candy cane tail of Sinosauropteryx was likely a social signal, used by these dinosaurs to communicate with each other when they met. This type of analysis reveals the potential of the emerging field of fossil coloration. By reconstructing long lost shades, paleontologists can detect and investigate ancient behaviors that have previously been hidden from view. Different colors tell different stories. The dark above, light below pattern and stripes of the horned dinosaur Psittacosaurus might indicate that this animal lived in a forested habitat with diffuse light, while the bandit mask and stripes of Sinosauropteryx might indicate a preference for more open habitats where blending in was critical to not being picked out by a larger carnivore. That the dinosaurs were camouflaged not only says something about where they lived, but also about the dangers they faced. Fossil color studies really do offer an unprecedented opportunity to make interpretations about behavior and biology from the fossil record, Colleary says. Paleontology has always been an interdisciplinary science, at the crossroads of multiple disciplines such as anatomy and geology. The study of fossil color expands the field further, drawing from biochemistry and advanced imaging techniques as well as the more traditional, morphological approaches. I think we need to be open to the fact that dinosaur research is not simply bone fondling anymore, Vinther says. There are tons of feathered dinosaurs and bird fossils still to be described, so soon we can write the Audubon Guide to Cretaceous Birds and Dinosaurs and show which habitats they lived in and perhaps soon show male and female feather coats, which certainly would have varied in many dinosaur species. Research continues, but whats already been found raises questions about what might be gleaned yet from the fossil record. Perhaps we will one day find that they had seasonal plumage, like colorful displays for the mating time, Vinther says, and if we ever find soft tissue dinosaurs in higher latitudes, like Australia, perhaps we will see some with white plumage during the cold and snowy winters. Such a find would truly be a dinosaur of a different color."}, {"title": "Newly Discovered Bat-Like Dinosaur Reveals the Intricacies of Prehistoric Flight", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "May 8, 2019", "doc": "About 160 million years ago, in the depths of the Jurassic, feathered dinosaurs started to take to the air. Clawed arms that had evolved to snatch and catch began to take on a new aerodynamic role, and feather coated limbs began flapping as the earliest avian dinosaurs overcame gravity to leave the surface of the Earth behind. But not all fluffy saurians launched into the air the same way. An unexpected discovery from China reveals an enigmatic family of dinosaurs with bat like wings. The first of these dinosaurs, given the adorable moniker Yi qi, was described by paleontologist Xing Xu and colleagues in 2015. While the small dinosaur had a coating of fuzz, its wings were primarily made up of a membrane stretched between the fingers and body. The dinosaurs wings were more like those of bats, which wouldnt evolve for more than 100 million years, or like the leathery wings of contemporary flying reptiles called pterosaurs. Yi was unlike any dinosaur ever founduntil now. Chinese Academy of Sciences paleontologist Min Wang and colleagues have just named a second bat like dinosaur related to Yi in the journal Nature Ambopteryx longibrachium. I was frozen when I realized that a second membranous winged dinosaur was in front of my eyes, Wang says. The 163 million year old fossil confirms that Yi was not an aberration or a one off. Together, the two species represent an alternate evolutionary path for airborne dinosaurs. A delicately preserved skeleton surrounded by a splash of fossilized fuzz, with gut contents still inside the body cavity, Ambopteryx looks very similar to Yi. Both are close relatives within a group of small, fuzzy dinosaurs called scansoriopterygids. Ambopteryx differs from its relative in skeletal features, having a longer forelimb than hindlimb and fused vertebrae at the end of the tail that likely supported long feathers, but both represent a family of bat like dinosaurs that was previously unknown to experts. Its great to see another example of pterosaur like wings in a scansoriopterygid, says Washington University paleontologist Ashley Morhardt. The finding not only reinforces the case that such dinosaurs existed, but paleontologists can now draw stronger biomechanical parallels between the wings of these dinosaurs and those of pterosaurs. Paleontologists are not sure exactly what these little dinosaurs were doing with their wings, however. Ambopteryx and Yi were less likely to be capable of flapping flight, Wang says. The dinosaurs may have been gliders, similar to flying squirrels of modern forests. Additional studies could help reveal how these dinosaurs moved and any similarities to the flapping of early birds, Morhardt says. The brain anatomies of airborne dinosaurs, for example, can show specific functions related to flying, but unfortunately the little bat like dinosaur specimens have been somewhat smooshed over geologic time. Sadly, like many similar fossils, the skulls of Yi and Ambopteryx appear to be flattened like pancakes due to the pressure and time, Morhardt says, making it impossible to get a good look at their brains. Yet theres more to Ambopteryx than its flapping abilities. The Ambopteryx skeleton is the best fossil of its family yet found, offering a more detailed look at the strange scansoriopterygids that have been puzzling paleontologists for years. Inside the body cavity of Ambopteryx are gizzard stonestiny pebbles to help crush foodand fragments of bones. Along with the anatomy of the teeth, Wang says, the evidence suggests Ambopteryx and its relatives were probably omnivorous dinosaurs, gobbling up whatever they could. The skeletal details of these dinosaurs will no doubt play into the ongoing debate about how some dinosaurs, including the first birds, started to flap and fly. Wang and colleagues call the two little dinos an experiment in the origins of flight. Ultimately, however, it didnt take off. No dinosaurs like Yi or Ambopteryx have been found from the later Cretaceous period, when birds proliferated and pterosaurs of all sizes still soared through the skies. Yi and Ambopteryx represent another way dinosaurs took to the air, perhaps gliding from tree to tree to find food and shelter, but ultimately they were destined for the ground, preserved for 160 million years in the rocks of modern day China for paleontologists to find and puzzle over while trying to piece together the mysteries of dinosaur flight."}, {"title": "When Tyrannosaurs Were Tiny", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "May 7, 2019", "doc": "In 1998, when Virginia Tech assistant professor Sterling Nesbitt was 16 years old, he travelled to the Zuni Basin of New Mexico to take part in a dig led by paleontologist Doug Wolfe. As luck would have it, Nesbitt hit upon the fossil of a small dinosaurthough experts werent able to identify the species that had left the remains behind. But now, in light of additional discoveries that have been made over the years, Nesbitt and his colleagues have been able to identify the 92 million year old fossil as an early and rather tiny Tyrannosaurus rex relative. Writing in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution, the researchers note that the multi tonne, bone crunching T. rex that has become a thundering icon of popular culture thrived in the Late Cretaceous, between 66 million and 80 million years ago. Discoveries of distant T. rex relatives have recently revealed that the tyrannosaur family long consisted of small carnivoreslike Dilong paradoxus, which was first found in China in 2004. But in the 1990s, when Nesbitt unearthed his fossil, the T. rexs less imposing origins were not widely known or recognized. Even today, the evolutionary history of the T. rex is not well understood, largely because extreme sea level rises during the Late Cretaceous destroyed fossils that had formed during the previous era, as Discovers Eric Betz explains. The newly described fossil is filling in some of those gaps. Researchers description of the dinosaur is based on two juvenile specimens the one uncovered by Nesbitt in 1998, and a partial skull found in 1997. Dubbed Suskityrannus hazelaein part after Suski, the Zuni Native American tribe word for coyotethe dinosaur stood around three feet tall at the hip and spanned around nine feet in length. Suskityrannus probably weighed between 45 and 95 pounds. It was not as small as the oldest tyrannosaurs, but it was considerably smaller than the T. rex, which could reach a weight of nine tons and boasted a skull that was about the same length as Suskityrannus entire body. The new dinosaur seems to represent an intermediate phase in tyrannosaur evolution, according to the study authors. Suskityrannus has some features seen in its later relativeslike an arctometatarsalian foot, which means that the three long bones that make up the sole of the foot are pinched together, with the middle bone being particularly skinny, Brown University PhD candidate Armita Manafzadeh, who was not involved in the new research, tells Gizmodos George Dvorsky. The arctometatarsalian foot has been linked to improved running ability, and Suskityrannus is the earliest known tyrannosaur to possess it. Speaking to Dvorsky, Nesbitt notes that Suskityrannus is not a direct ancestor of the T. rex it represents more of a side branch. Still, he says, the dinosaur gives us a glimpse into the evolution of tyrannosaurs just before they take over the planet."}, {"title": "Divers Find Ice Age Megafauna Remains in Underwater Mexican Cave", "author": "Meilan Solly", "date": "May 6, 2019", "doc": "Short faced bears, wolf like carnivores, saber toothed cats and elephant relatives known as gomphotheres are among the Ice Age creatures whose fossilized bones have been recovered from a submerged cave in Mexicos Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Known as Hoyo Negro, or black hole in Spanish, the cavernous, 200 foot pit lured unsuspecting ancients to their deaths, entrapping humans and animals alike in a dark cave system that eventually flooded and preserved their remains. As researchers led by Blaine Schubert of East Tennessee State University report in the journal Biology Letters, the trove includes bones dating to between 38,400 to 12,850 years agoa period encompassing much of Earths last Ice Age and the latter end of the Late Pleistocene Epoch. Although the majority of the fossils were retrieved from Hoyo Negro years ago, Schubert tells Live Sciences Laura Geggel that some were previously misidentified. The short faced bear, Arctotherium wingei, for example, was erroneously placed in the genus Tremarctos, while the wolf like Protocyon troglodytes was labeled as a coyote species, Canis latrans. According to Schubert, the latest study builds on new analysis and subsequent excavations to set the record straight. Thanks to the discovery of at least seven short faced bears, as well as the remains of two potential canids, the team now has a clearer picture of the animals geographic reach. Popular Mechanics David Grossman notes that the bear species, which boasts an upper weight limit of 3,500 pounds, is estimated to be the largest bear known to science. The whole previous record of this particular type of bear is just known from a few localities in South America, and those are fragmentary remains, Schubert says. So, we went from not having any of this type of bear outside of South America to now having the best record of this type of bear from the Yucat\u00e1n of Mexico. Bears and wolf cousins arent the only animals catalogued in the study As George Dvorsky writes for Gizmodo, the researchers also identified tapirs, cougars, dog like animals, and multiple ground sloth species, including the newly described Nohochichak xibalbahkah. Unlike most animal bones dating to Central Americas Late Pleistocene period, these remainsprotected from the tropical climate by Hoyo Negros low oxygen flood watersare remarkably well preserved. In 2007, divers exploring the underwater network unearthed the remains of an adolescent female who lived between 12,000 and  13,000 years ago. According to Yahoo News Will Metcalfe, the prehistoric girl, dubbed Naia, likely fell into the pit after entering the cave system in search of fresh water. Her bones, as well as those of at least 28 animals discovered to date, remained hidden in the depths for millennia. Live Sciences Geggel notes that the new research further adds to scientists understanding of the Great American Biotic Interchange GABI, which found plants and animals crossing over from North to South Americaand vice versaaround 2.5 to three million years ago. The North American short faced bear likely followed this path, with some members of the species opting to remain in Mexico during the journey south, or perhaps recrossing a land bridge from South to North America at a later time. We had no record of these animals making it back across that isthmus again until now, Schubert tells New Scientists Chelsea Whyte. Interestingly, Schubert and his colleagues posit that the number of glacial pulses, or ecological shifts, linked with GABI may stand at five rather than four. Occurring at, and as a result of, the end of the last Ice Age, in the words of Gizmodos Dvorsky, the fifth pulse would have triggered landscape changes and migration opportunities much like the previous four. Unlike these earlier incidents, however, the studys authors write that the last wave would have involved humans and culminated with the mass extinction of most American megafauna, including Arctotherium and Protocyon."}, {"title": "New Analysis of Depression-Era Fossil Hunt Shows Texas Coast Was Once a \u2018Serengeti\u2019", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "April 16, 2019", "doc": "Between 1939 and 1941, amateur paleontologists collected thousands of 11 to 12 million year old fossils from the Texas Coastal Plain. The project was part of the State Wide Paleontologic Mineralogic Survey funded by the Works Progress Administration, a government agency that created employment for roughly 8.5 million people nationwide, including turning some everyday Texans into bone hunters. Now, their hard work is aiding modern researchers, who used the collection, stored at the University of Texas at Austin, to show that part of the Gulf Coast was the ancient equivalent of the Serengeti. While other studies have looked at the survey bones before, George Dvorsky at Gizmodo reports that new research led by Steven May, research associate at UT Austins Jackson School of Geosciences, focused specifically on bones collected at four sites around Beeville, Texas. For the study, the first to assess the entire Depression era collection from the region, he and his team looked at roughly 4,000 specimens from 50 different species that lived along the ancient oceanfront. They found that 11 million to 12 million years ago, the area was full of animals Rhinoceros, antelope and camels were common along with 12 species of horse like animals and four rodents. They also found two bird species, seven reptiles, and five types of fish. The collection even included a new genus of an elephant like animal called a gomphothere, an extinct relative of modern dogs, as well as the oldest alligator fossil unearthed in North America. The research appears in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica. Its the most representative collection of life from this time period of Earth history along the Texas Coastal Plain, May says in a press release. There were, of course, problems with hiring untrained people to dig up fossils that the team had to account for. Naturally, the WPA workers tended to focus on large bones from large vertebrates. They collected the big, obvious stuff, May says. Because that didnt offer the team a complete picture of the environment, they decided to supplement the Great Depression era work by searching aerial photos and archival material in an effort to determine the original dig sites.\n\nThey pinpointed one on Buckner Ranch and returned to the area, looking for things unskilled fossil hunters may have overlooked, including rodent teeth and tiny bones. The effort added many new species to the original list. According to the paper, there are still 86 large fossils encased in plaster from the area that need to be studied. The researchers also plan to conduct isotope analysis to understand the various diets and habitats found near the Beeville dig sites. Texas wasnt the only state to employ WPA workers to dig up fossils. In Oklahoma, work crews of the Fossil Bones Project dug up about 30,000 specimens. Crews working in Nebraska also unearthed thousands of bones and the University of California supervised WPA paleontology programs across that state."}, {"title": "The Hominins We\u2019ve Been Calling Denisovans Are More Diverse Than Previously Thought", "author": "Meilan Solly", "date": "April 12, 2019", "doc": "A new DNA analysis of 161 modern human genomes spanning islands across Southeast Asia and New Guinea suggests the Denisovans, an elusive early hominin species identified in 2010, boasted a far more complex family tree than once believed. As a team of international researchers report in the journal Cell, the human cousins currently labeled as Denisovans comprised at least three diverse populationsincluding a lineage so distinct that it may even constitute an entirely separate species. As Live Sciences Charles Q. Choi reports, scientists first realized the Denisovans had more than one lineage in 2018. This finding, also detailed in Cell, drew on modern DNA to reveal that the early hominins likely interbred with Homo sapiens in two waves, creating varied genetic legacies still seen in contemporary residents of Oceania and East Asia. One of these lineages was closely related to the Denisovans whose fragmented bones were unearthed in Siberias Altai Mountain, or Denisova, cave in 2010, carrying DNA found in modern East Asians. The second lineage had more limited genetic ties with the Denisovan specimens known to science and carried DNA evident in Papua New Guineans and South Asians. This latest study further diversifies the Denisovan lineage, revealing that the non Altai group flourished alongside a population never previously identified. Dubbed D1 and D2, Dyani Lewis notes for Cosmos, these groups split off from the Altai Denisovans, or D0, some 283,000 years ago, and from each other around 363,000 years ago. As the researchers explain, the D1 populations genetic legacy is largely restricted to Papuans, while D2s has a wider geographical distribution spanning much of Asia and Oceania. Crucially, senior author Murray Cox, a computational biologist at New Zealands Massey University, tells the Economist, the D2 group is about as different from the individual found in the Denisova cave as it is from Neanderthals. If were going to call Neanderthals and Denisovans by special names, Cox continues, this new group probably needs a new name, too. The researchers analysis points toward Denisovan and modern human interbreeding occurring as recently as 15,000 years ago. If supported, this would make the Denisovans, rather than the Neanderthals, the last hominin cousin to disappear from the planet. Traces of Denisovan DNA found in contemporary humans have implications for health care in the tropical region of Southeast Asia. As Cox tells Live Sciences Choi, genetic variations passed down by early hominin interbreeding continue to influence the health of people today, mostly positively, sometimes negatively. Moving forward, Cox says, the scientists hope to use their findings to improve health care for the millions of individuals who, thanks to the research bias toward those of European descent, have essentially no existing research foundation. What do these archaic variants do? Cox asks. Why do we still have them? The Denisovan teams findings arrive close on the heels of another key addition to the increasingly complex timeline of human evolution. As a different team of scientists wrote in the journal Nature earlier this week, 13 bones and teeth found in a cave on the island of Luzon in the Philippines point toward the existence of a newly identified hominin species known as Homo luzonensis. Diminutive human ancestors who stood an estimated three to four feet tall, these individuals populated the Earth some 50,000 to 67,000 years ago. Homo luzonensis, the newly discovered D2 lineage and Homo floresiensisa hominin species discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores in 2003 and given the nickname Hobbit for its tiny sizetestify to the significant, yet understudied role Southeast Asia played in the development of humanity. The genomes in the Cell paper  are the first genomes from Indonesia, Cox explains to Discover magazines Nathaniel Scharping. Thats pretty amazing because Indonesia is the worlds fourth largest country, its got 250 million people and its as big as continental Europe. It just shows that disparity between science that happens in the West versus science that happens in developing countries."}, {"title": "A New Human Ancestor Species Was Discovered in the Philippines", "author": "Meilan Solly", "date": "April 11, 2019", "doc": "Scientists have identified a new human ancestor species previously unknown to science Meet Homo luzonensis. Standing an estimated three to four feet tall, Homo luzonensisclassified as a separate species on the basis of 13 bones and teeth from two adults and one child found in a cave on the island of Luzon in the Philippinesadds another twist to the increasingly complex timeline of human evolution. Some 50,000 to 67,000 years ago, the diminutive hominin roamed Earth alongside a host of other early humans, including Neanderthals, Denisovans, similarly petite Homo floresiensis, and our own species, Homo sapiens. As paleoanthropologist Rick Potts, director of the Smithsonian Institutions Human Origins Program, tells the Washington Posts Ben Guarino, The evolution of our evolutionary group, Homo, is getting weirder and weirder. Homo luzonensis, described this week in the journal Nature, boasted an eclectic mix of features comparable to different species of hominins. Unlike Homo sapiens, whose premolar teeth generally have a single root, Homo luzonensis premolars had two or three roots, similar to more primitive species such as Homo erectus, which lived in Africa and Asia between about 1.89 million and 143,000 years ago. The species molars were incredibly small with single roots, Lizzie Wade reports for Science magazineeven smaller than those of Homo floresiensis, a hominin species discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores in 2003 and given the nickname Hobbit for its tiny size.  Given that tooth size is generally indicative of body size, its likely Homo luzonensis was smaller than Homo sapiens, and perhaps even smaller than Homo floresiensis, as the studys lead author Florent D\u00e9troit, a paleoanthropologist at Paris Museum of Man, explains to Wade. Still, D\u00e9troit tells Reuters Will Dunham, We have to stay cautious about it, especially because people will immediately have Homo floresiensis in mind as a model for the physical appearance of Homo luzonensis, which was certainly not the case. A clear difference between the newly discovered species and most members of the Homo genus is Homo luzonensis curved finger and toe bones, reports NPRs Christopher Joyce. The digits closely resemble those of Australopithecus, a group of tree climbing, ape like creatures that populated the planet as early as several million years before the advent of Homo erectus, Earths first known hominin to migrate out of Africa. As Michael Greshko and Maya Wei Haas write for National Geographic, Homo erectus likely used land bridges to reach what is now Indonesia around a million years ago. Previously, most researchers believed it would have been impossible for early hominins to venture farther east without boats, but the discovery of Homo floresiensis and Homo luzonensis suggests our ancient relatives were better traveled than once thought. Susan Anton, a New York University anthropologist who was not involved in the new research, tells the Posts Guarino that early hominins may have arrived on distant islands, including Luzon, during tsunamis and major weather events. Anton explains that waves could have swept these individuals, clinging onto debris in an instinctual attempt to survive, to places that they maybe shouldnt be. Members of Homo floresiensis are thought to have evolved from an early hominin, perhaps Homo erectus, developing their small stature only after landing on isolated islandsand the same could be true for Homo luzonensis, Kiona N. Smith reports for Ars Technica. Its also possible that Homo luzonensis descended from a Homo lineage other than Homo erectus. Matthew Tocheri, an anthropologist at Lakehead University who wrote a Nature News and Views piece accompanying the study, tells Smith that Homo luzonensis and Homo floresiensis could just as easily be descendants of another Homo species that left Africa around the same time as Homo erectus. The two toe bones, two finger bones, seven teeth, femur shaft and foot bone unearthed in Luzon offer only scant evidence of the two adults and one child whose remains they represent. Although the authors of the Nature study found that the fragments are distinct enough to warrant their classification as an entirely new species, others remain unconvincedparticularly because the team was unable to extract DNA from the bones and teeth, which have spent millennia in the humid confines of Luzon Islands Callao Cave. One alternative explanation for the unusual bones, according to Sciences Wade, is that the remains belong to a locally adapted population of Homo erectus or a similar early hominin. I see what theyre saying, but at the same time, I want more, Anton explains to Sciences Wade, adding that the discovery of a skull bone or intact DNA could further solidify the scientists conclusions. Aida G\u00f3mez Robles, a paleoanthropologist at University College London who reviewed the study prior to publication, tells National Geographics Greshko and Wei Haas the research is absolutely one of the most important findings that will be out in a number of years. Regardless of whether Homo luzonensis is widely accepted as a wholly separate lineage, the results testify to the diversity of early hominin species. As Tocheri concludes to The New York Times Carl Zimmer, The more fossils that people pull out of the ground, the more we realize that the variation that was present in the past far exceeds what we see in us today."}, {"title": "\u2018Exquisitely Preserved\u2019 Skin Impressions Found in Dinosaur Footprints", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "April 11, 2019", "doc": "During a large scale excavation at the Jinju Formation in South Korea, a set of five tiny dinosaur tracks were spotted on a slab of fine, grey sandstone. This in itself wasnt unusual paleontologists find dinosaur footprints relatively often. But when Kyung Soo Kim of South Koreas Chinju National University of Education and his colleagues took a closer look at the tracks, they could see impressions of the prehistoric creatures skina rarity, since less than one percent of dinosaur print show skin traces. And that wasnt all. These are the first tracks ever found where perfect skin impressions cover the entire surface of every track, says Martin Lockley, a geologist at the University of Colorado Denver and co author of a new study in Scientific Reports. The footprints were left by Minisauripus, the smallest known theropod, meaning it walked on two legs, and an ichnogenus, meaning that it is known only from fossilized footprints and trackwaysnot from fossilized bone. The tracks are about an inch long and were imprinted during the Early Cretaceous, between 112 and 120 million years ago, making them the oldest Minisauripus footprints in the fossil record, according to Gizmodos George Dvorsky. Including the latest discovery, Minisauripus tracks have been found at ten different sites, but this was the first one that still contained traces of the dinosaurs skin. The imprints are, according to the study authors, exquisitely preserved. Experts could see traces of little scales, each between one third to one half a millimeter in diameter, displayed in perfect arrays, like well woven fabric, according to the University of Colorado. It is believed that the texture of the dinosaurs skin was the grade of a medium sandpaper. Skin impressions have been found in dinosaur footprints before, but these impressions were patchy and didnt cover every print in the trackway. The newly discovered Minisauripus tracks are outliers thanks to unusual and optimal preservation conditions, the study authors write. The blackbird sized dinosaur that made them stepped onto a thin layer of mud, about a millimeter thick, that was sufficiently firm and sticky to stop the animal from sliding around and smudging the prints. It is also possible that the dinosaur had loose and flexible skin, allowing it to spread when contacting with the substrate so as not to shift or slide and smear the fine skin traces as they were registered, according to the researchers. Once the dinosaur had moved on, the tracks were covered with another fine mud layer. Even imprints of raindrops that fell before the dinosaur arrived were preserved on the slab, and the researchers could see that the Minisauripus had stepped on one of drops. The skin pattern found in the prints is similar to that of Cretaceous era feathered birds from China, but the shape of the animals feet is markedly different, leading scientists to conclude that the tracks were not left by an avian species. Indeed, the Minisauripus skin pattern also bears similarity to fragmentary imprints from larger, carnivorous theropods. In addition to offering researchers the first detailed insight into the skin texture of a diminutive theropod, as the study authors put it, the recent discovery sheds new light on the timeline of the Minisauripus ichnogenus presence in modern day Korea. All previously known Korean Minisauripus tracks were unearthed at a geological site called the Haman Formation, which is between 112 and 100 million years old. The newly found prints, unearthed at the Jinju Formation, are between 10 and 20 million years older, suggesting that the species that left the tracks was frolicking aboutand leaving its markearlier than previously thought."}, {"title": "How Did Whales Reach the Americas? A Four-Legged Fossil Offers New Clues", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "April 5, 2019", "doc": "The story of modern whales begins around 50 million years ago, in what is today India and Pakistan, with four legged hoofed mammals about the size of a wolf. As whales ancient ancestors became increasingly adapted to aquatic environments, they dispersed to North Africa and then to the Americas, eventually losing their hind legs and gaining flippers. But due to fragmentary fossil evidence, the outlines of this journey are fuzzy. Scientists are not entirely sure when these early whales migrated, what route they took, or how they adapted along the way. As Leila Miller reports for the Los Angeles Times, a newly described, four legged whale fossil from Peru is helping fill in some of these gaps. Discovered in 2011 in Perus Pisco Basin, the fossil dates to 43 million years ago and points to a creature that stretched about 13 feet long and had four legs strong enough to support its weight on land. The whale also had a robust tail, which it likely used to move through water. Writing in the journal Current Biology, an international team of researchers reveal that the fossil represents the first record of an amphibious whale for the whole Pacific Ocean. The researchers have dubbed the species, which was previously unknown to scientists, Peregocetus pacificus, or the travelling whale that reached the Pacific Ocean. Peregocetus is likely the oldest four legged whale ever found in the Americas and the most complete outside India and Pakistan, Olivier Lambert, lead study author and a vertebrate paleontologist at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, says in a Natural History Museum statement. Because the fossil was unusually well preserved, scientists were able to observe a number of features adapted for life both on land and in the water. Peregocetus had a long snout and sharp teeth, which suggests it was snacking on bony fish. The excavation team did not uncover the whales last vertebrae, so they do not know if it had a flukethe paddle like appendage that modern whales use for propulsion. But Peregocetus was likely a powerful swimmer. The anatomy of the first vertebrae of the tail resembles that of amphibious mammals such as otters and beavers, says Lambert. So we think the animal propelled through the water by wave like movements of the posterior part of the body, including the tail, and by moving its large feet and long toes that were most likely webbed. Peregocetus fore and hind legs are very similar to those of its ancestors from India and Pakistan, and its fingers and toes were crowned with hooves that would have helped it move about outside of the water. But Peregocetus probably wasnt particularly adept at walking and certainly not at running on land, Lambert tells Miller of the L.A. Times. The animal may have only surfaced onto terrestrial environments for specific activities, like breeding and giving birth. The location of the fossil on the coast of the southeastern Pacific suggests that early whales arrived in the Americas by crossing the south Atlantic between Africa and South America, the researchers say. At this point in prehistory, the distance between the continents was half of what it is today, and the whales may have been helped along by surface currents. But they still would have needed to spend days, or even weeks, at seaanother indication that they were becoming increasingly adapted to marine environments. Peregocetus thus represents an important evolutionary link between the earliest whales and the fully aquatic ones we know today. According to the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, some of Peregocetus four legged relatives eventually spread to the east coast of North America and evolved into the basilosaurids, a group of aquatic whales that emerged around 41 million years ago and retained very small hind limbs. The basilosaurids gave rise to the two groups of modern whales baleen whales, like the humpback and blue whale, and toothed whales, like the dolphin and sperm whale. They went from small hoofed mammals to the blue whale we have today, Travis Park, a postdoctoral fellow at the Natural History Museum who studies cetacean evolution and was not involved in the recent study, tells the Guardians Hannah Devlin. Its so interesting to see how they conquered the oceans."}, {"title": "New Type of Arctic Dinosaur Discovered in Alaska", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "April 3, 2019", "doc": "The Liscomb Bonebed along the Colville River in Alaskas North Slope is chock full of duck billed dinosaur fossils. In fact, over 99 percent of the 6,000 dinosaur fossils pulled from the quarry are hadrosaurines, one branch of the hadrosaur, or non crested duck billed dinosaur tree. A newly identified fossil, however, adds a bit of unexpected variety to the prehistoric Arctic ecosystem researchers found the fossilized remains of a lambeosaurine, a crested duck billed dino, according to a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports. In 2014, paleontologists from the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas were examining a cache of fossils from the 70 million year old bonebed when they came across a fragment of skull that seemed different from the others, reports Priscella Hwang at the CBC. Most of the bones in Liscomb came from a species of hadrosaur called Edmontosaurus, but the team believed this fragment might come from a theropod dinosaur. When that turned out not to be the case, the museum filed the bone fragment away with the other hadrosaurs. When grad student Ryuji Takasaki from Hokkaido University in Japan came to the museum to study the hadrosaur fossils, however, he also picked up on the strange skull fragment. This guy probably looked at more Edmontosaurus bones than anyone else on the planet, paleontologist Anthony Fiorillo of the Perot Museum tells Hwang. He came into my office one day and said, This is something different. On closer analysis, the fragment was found to belong to a lambeosaurine, a type of duck billed dinosaur with large hollow crest on its head. This first definitive evidence of a crested hadrosaur in the Cretaceous Arctic tells us that we still have much to learn about the biodiversity and the biologically productive environments of the ancient north, and that the story these fossils tell us is continually evolving, Fiorillo says in a press release. Stephanie Pappas at LiveScience reports that prior to this find, the furthest north a lambeosaurine was found was southern Alberta. In other parts of the world, lambeosaurines are found in upland habitat and the team believes that the animals were likely extremely rare along the coast. The find also suggests that there may be a link between the lambeosaurines found in North America and those found in Asia. The Arctic was a bit warmer and forested during the Late Cretaceous when these dinosaurs lived, but life was still much more challenging than it was for dinosaur living in the tropical or subtropical areas of Earth. The Associated Press reported in 2015 that the mean annual temperature hovered around 40 degrees Fahrenheit and was similar to present day British Columbia. At least four unique dinosaur species have been confirmed in the region and paleontologists believe they have found evidence for a dozen species of polar dinos in the area, suggesting that certain dinosaurs were adapted to the colder, harsher climate. Gregory Erickson of Florida State University, who helped discover a new species of hadrosaur along the Liscomb Bonebed in 2015 says its basically a lost world of dinosaurs that we didnt realize existed. Paleontologists have not found cold blooded animals like lizards, turtles or crocodiles in the region, suggesting that the polar dinos may have been able to regulate their own body temperature, which may help researchers better understand dinosaur physiology. How these giant creatures managed to live in the relatively resource poor Arctic could also help us understand how contemporary creatures may adapt as the current climate changes. Even in an ancient Arctic, it was a very rich environment capable of animals that thrived in it, Fiorello tells Hwang. Studying this ecosystem and understanding how it works, may help inform what a modern warming Arctic may look like. These hardy dinos werent just restricted to the Arctic. Paleontologists have found polar dinosaurs in Australia and Antarctica that evolved in similar conditions."}, {"title": "Fossil Site May Capture the Dinosaur-Killing Impact, but It\u2019s Only the Beginning of the Story", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "April 3, 2019", "doc": "It may be considered one of the worst days in the history of life on Earth.

This line in the stone is also the marker for the end of the Age of Dinosaurs and the beginning of the Age of Mammals, a shift that has been intensely debated and studied for decades. Now a fossil site in North Dakota is causing a new stir, said to document the last minutes and hours of the dinosaurian reign. The fossil assemblage, nicknamed Tanis after the real life ancient Egyptian city referenced in Raiders of the Lost Ark, was first described in an article the New Yorker. Excavated and studied by University of Kansas graduate student Robert DePalma and a team of international collaborators, the site contains glassy spherules of material believed to have come from the impact event, thousands of miles away. Also embedded in the rock and debris, the New Yorker reported, are delicately preserved fossil fish, marine organisms far from the nearest sea, ancient plants, prehistoric mammals, and, perhaps most significantly, dinosaur bones, eggs and even feathers. Many paleontologists were quick to raise an eyebrow at the findings presented in the New Yorker, however, particularly because some of the claims in the article are not mentioned in a scientific paper about the site. That research, published by DePalma and colleagues, was released Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. The only dinosaur fossil mentioned in the paper is a weathered hip fragment, but the study is nevertheless causing a stir as a window into the extreme effects caused by the asteroid impact. Unfortunately, many interesting aspects of this study appear only in the New Yorker article and not in the scientific paper, says Kirk Johnson, director of the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. This is a sloppy way to conduct science and it leaves open many questions. At the present moment, interesting data are presented in the paper while other elements of the story that could be data are, for the moment, only rumors. As for the paper itself, the details are part of a broader picture of what transpired 66 million years ago in western North America, along the margins of a vanishing seaway that was draining off the continent at the time. According to DePalma and colleagues, seismic waves emanating from the asteroid impact reached the Tanis area within minutes. The disturbance sloshed local bodies of water in a phenomenon called a seichesimilar to water flowing back and forth in a bathtubtossing fish and other organisms around in the wave. As far as we can tell, DePalma says in an email, the majority of the articulated carcasses are from animals that were either killed when they were encapsulated by the muddy sediment, or very shortly prior as part of the same violent inundation surge event. In addition to articulated fish fossils with their scales still in place, the site contains shell fragments from seagoing mollusks called ammonites. DePalma and colleagues suspect that their presence is a sign that a previously unrecognized pocket of the Western Interior Seaway provided the water that ripped over the land and buried the Tanis site. Sites demarcating the KPg boundary have been found all over the world, and vertebrate fossils at or within the boundary have also been discovered before. Part of what makes the Tanis site stand out, DePalma says, is that this is the first known example of articulated carcasses, likely killed as a direct result of the impact, associated with the boundary. Despite the controversy over how claims of the site hit mass media before the peer reviewed science paper was available, outside experts note that Tanis truly does seem to be an exceptional spot. This isnt the only site that preserves fossils at the KPg boundary, but it seems this might be the most sensational one ever discovered, says Shaena Montanari, a paleontologist and AAAS science and technology policy fellow. The fossil preservation of the fish in particular stands out as unusual. I thumbed through the pictures of the fossils included in the supplement and they look absolutely incredible, Montanari says. Some of these fish have debris from the impact preserved in their gills, little pebbles of natural glass, perhaps sucked up from the water as the particles landed in ancient North Dakota shortly after the impact. Much of what makes Tanis exciting, according to University of New Mexico postdoctoral fellow James Witts, is that it offers a range of geologic clues about what happened after the impact. This study convincingly links evidence from impact ejecta, sedimentology and geochemistry with well dated physical remains of animals and plants that appear to have been alive right at the time of the impact event. It could be a snapshot of life not thousands or hundreds of years before, but during the cataclysm that shook the Earth. How Tanis was created is also something of a novelty. Geologists have studied disturbances that the Chicxulub impact caused at other sites, but these spots represent what happened in the ancient ocean and not on land. If DePalma and colleagues are correct, then seiche waves washing over terrestrial environments is another effect of the impact that hasnt been examined before, depositing the remains of sea creatures where they otherwise had no business. A number of additional mysteries remain about the site as well. The marine fossils, for example, might not have come from a nearby remnant of sea but could have been fossils when the asteroid struck, ripped up by the seismic and seiche waves that buried Tanis. It has to remain an open question as to whether the ammonites were reworked out of rocks that would have essentially been the bedrock at Tanis, or if they come from a population that lived in a reduced seaway to the east of Tanis that we have no record of because of later erosion, Witts says. Other geologic details of the site also merit further investigation. It seems like the geochemical data are scant and in some cases being stretched a bit to make interpretations, Montanari says, although this is not a new thing for paleontology. These data points can be used to measure when and how quickly the Tanis site formed, critical details when attempting to determine what the site actually records. Montanari says that additional data points and analysis would strengthen the case that Tanis represents a very short window of the last Cretaceous moments. We need to be sure we are developing rigorous hypotheses and then testing them with the available evidence rather than trying to craft a scenario that fits exactly what is uncovered, Montanari says. University of California, Berkeley paleontologist Pat Holroyd says that the estimations of when and how quickly the Tanis site formed are based on models without consideration of other possible interpretations. I dont think there is any way to conclusively determine the exact amount of time represented in the site, she says, but it would have been useful to see how they estimated it. The details of what the site actually looks like, and how the layers were deposited, is not clear from what was published in the paper, Holroyd says. Such data is needed to compare Tanis to other KPg sites around the world. Higher resolution images of the entire section would be of interest to many people as a resource for comparison to other types of deposits thought to be produced by seismic waves, Holroyd says. For now, Tanis is a localized phenomenon. Its relevance to other sites in North America, and around the globe, awaits further study. Seismic shaking from the impact could potentially have caused surges in other pockets far from the impact site, affecting that tapestry of microecologies as well, DePalma says. The site is also unique in that it appears to capture a small moment of geologic time. Its very tricky interpreting any rock outcrop as recording and preserving events operating on such a short timescale, Witts says. The study does seem to show a rapid, violent event, but the details of the site will undoubtedly be further investigated and tested to see if the extraordinary claims hold up to scrutiny. Witts hopes that the paper will help spur further discussion and analysis of other KPg sites around the globe. While geology is often thought of in terms of slow, gradual change, sometimes rapid transformation occurs. I think Tanis reminds us geologists that sometimes it looks like the depositional stars align, and remarkable events could leave a signature preserved in the rock and fossil record, he says. Ultimately Tanis will be another part of a much broader story. The extinction at the end of the Cretaceous was a global event that played out over the course of days, weeks, months and years. Despite the fact that the site has been heralded as recording the day the dinosaurs died, theres no way to know when the very last non avian dinosaur went extinct. The last terrible lizard likely fell long after the events recorded at Tanis, likely in another part of the world. DePalma says there is more to come from the Tanis site, and the mismatch between the claims made in the New Yorker article and the PNAS paper comes down to triage of what papers get priority. We are already working on multiple follow up papers and will be fully examining and reporting on everything found thus far, he says. The discussion about what Tanis means is only just beginning. Im sure paleontologists will be eager to see this material and do additional studies on Tanis, Montanari says. I cant wait to see the rest of whats to come."}, {"title": "Earth\u2019s Largest River Delta Was the Size of Alaska", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "April 2, 2019", "doc": "It seems like everything was bigger in the Triassic period. The dinosaurs, of course, were colossal, the volcanic eruptions were massive and even the land area was supersized across the vast supercontinent Pangaea. Now researchers have found another superlative to add to the list. The largest river delta to ever exist on Earth was formed during the Triassic. Michael Marshall at New Scientist reports that the massive delta floodplain was ten times the size of the Amazon and Ganges deltas, the current largest delta floodplains on the planet. It dates to 227 to 237 million years ago, around the time when the first mammals and dinosaurs evolved. Researchers identified the delta in the Barents Sea between the north of Norway and Russia by examining core samples drilled by energy exploration companies and examining seismic data. The delta was so large, if it were around today, at roughly 637,100 square miles, it easily covers Alaska with mileage to spare. So what created such a massive delta? The flood plain was likely formed by sediments carried from mountains created when continents collided during the formation of Pangaea. Those events, called the Variscan Orogeny and Uralian Orogeny created the mountains of Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Great Britain as well as the Ural Mountans, which extend through west central Russia. The drainage for the Triassic deltas could have been twice that of what feeds Mississippi today, Tore Grane Klausen of the University of Bergen and lead author of the study in the journal Geology tells Jonathan Carey at Atlas Obscura via email. The delta wasnt just a flash in the Triassic pan. The team estimates that it grew over the course of 2 to 5 million years, which lines up with the idea that the Triassic had a pretty steady warm climate in which sea level did not change much. Most of the deltas currently found on Earth appeared in the last 10,000 years. Marshall at New Scientist reports that during the Triassic, areas near the equator were likely too hot and dry to support much biodiversity. River deltas, like this one, however, were probably cradles of life, just as they are today. The area was likely covered in lush vegetation and full of labyrinthodonts, an amphibian forerunner of many land animals. Its possible the earliest dinos and mammals also skittered across the deltas sediments. The fossils found at the site seem to bear this out. Everywhere you look, you can pick up these sandstone samples with imprints of ferns, Klausen tells Marshall. So whats the name of this magnificent geographical wonder? The researchers suggest calling the area the Snadd Delta after the rock formation in which it was found, though we think the better name for it might be Amazon Prime."}, {"title": "International Expedition Will Excavate the Dino-Rich \u2018Jurassic Mile\u2019", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "March 28, 2019", "doc": "For over a century, paleontologists have been digging in the Morrison Formation, the famous western North American cache of dinosaur fossils. While the southern part of the formation, which includes Dinosaur National Monument, has been pretty well studied, the northern reaches still hold a lot of  secrets. Thats why an international consortium of paleontological institutions is funding a 27.5 million project dubbed Mission Jurassic to excavate an entire square mile of the formation this summer. More than 100 paleontologists are coming together to dig the Jurassic Mile, which is located on private ranchland around 100 miles east of Yellowstone National Park, the Associated Press reports. The dig is being led by the Childrens Museum of Indianapoliswhich has 18 years left on its 20 year lease from the landowner of the sitealong with the Natural History Museum in London and the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands. The Childrens Museum has already spent two field seasons digging on its own, excavating nearly 600 fossils including an 80 foot long Brachiosaur and 90 foot long Diplodocid, Domenica Bongiovanni at The Indianapolis Star reports. Already, inside the Jurassic Mile, paleontologists have found four quarries full of dino bones in the excavation area. Drone footage has identified many more potential dig sites as well. But the Morrison Formation isnt just full of bonesit also has lots of dinosaur footprints and fossils from plants as well as other creatures. Phil Manning, chair of natural history at the University of Manchester, tells Bongiovanni of the Star that the team hopes to learn more about gymnosperms, ginkos, cycads, ferns and other plants that existed in the Late Jurassic to solve a riddle How did plant eating dinosaurs grow so huge while eating a nutrient poor diet? Its a bit like me giving you a diet of water and oats for your whole life and you end up being 30 feet tall, Manning says. We truly do not yet understand how they managed it. In many digs, resources and funding constraints mean that paleontologists spend an entire field seasonor severaldigging up one dinosaur fossil. The scale of Mission Jurassic, however, will allow researchers to excavate a much larger area during the project and proceed more quickly. The Childrens Museum has already announced that some of the Jurassic era bones discovered will be used to expand its Dinosphere exhibition, which currently focuses on the later Cretaceous period, the time when dinosaurs eventually went extinct."}, {"title": "Meet Scotty, the Largest and Longest-Lived T. Rex Ever Found", "author": "Meilan Solly", "date": "March 27, 2019", "doc": "Some 66 million years ago, a Tyrannosaurus rex weighing an estimated 19,555 poundsnearly as much as four pick up trucksroamed what is now the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. Measuring roughly 42 feet long, the dinosaur led what University of Alberta paleontologist Scott Persons describes as an unusually long but violent life, enduring injuries ranging from broken ribs to an infected jaw before dying in its early 30s. Researchers first unearthed the formidable T. rexs remains in 1991, Michael Greshko reports for National Geographic. Given the dinosaurs sheer size and encasement in cement like sandstone, however, it took more than two decades to fully excavate and analyze the bones. Luckily, the paleontologists behind the find write in the Anatomical Record, the results were worth the wait Not only is the T. rex, nicknamed Scotty in honor of a celebratory toast of scotch raised upon its discovery, the biggest member of its species ever found, but it also holds the distinction of being the longest lived T. rex identified in the fossil record to date. This is the rex of rexes, study lead author Persons observes in a statement. There is considerable size variability among Tyrannosaurus. Some individuals were lankier than others and some were more robust. Scotty exemplifies the robust. To gauge Scottys size, Persons and his colleagues measured its leg, hip and shoulder bones. According to Gizmodos George Dvorsky, although the dinosaurs skeleton is only 65 percent complete, the team was able to estimate its body mass by using the circumference of the femur to calculate the amount of weight the legs could withstand. Compared to 11 similarly well preserved T. rex skeletons, Scotty appears to have the advantage in terms of pure mass, if not height and overall length. Sue, a dinosaur unearthed in 1990 and the previous biggest T. rex record holder, weighed an estimated 18,651 pounds, or some five percent lighter than the new heavyweight title winner. Still, its worth pointing out that biggest dinosaur is a fairly imprecise measure. As Brian Switek explains for Scientific American, biggest could refer to weight, length or a combination of the two. Switek writes Given all sorts of variations, itd be possible for two T. rex to have exactly the same length but have different weightsor have different weights at varying lengthsin which case awarding a superlative title becomes subjective. Switek further notes that Scottys skeleton is far less complete than Sues, which remains around 90 percent intact. John Hutchinson, an evolutionary biomechanics expert from the University of Londons Royal Veterinary College who was not involved in the new research, tells Gizmodos Dvorsky that Scotty is not appreciably larger than other known specimens. Instead, Hutchinson says, the difference is at best five percent, and that is with a wide margin of error. In all, Switek says, Scotty and Sue likely stood within just a few ounces and inches of each other. Regardless of Scottys exact place in the T. rex lineage, it remains impressive for its longevity and seemingly battle worn lifestyle. At some point in the dinosaurs 30 year or so existence, it encountered enemies that inflicted such injuries as an infected jaw, an impacted tooth and broken ribs. Damage evident on Scottys tail vertebrae also indicates it was bitten by a fellow T. rex. Its probably no coincidence that Scotty was both enormous and long lived Roni Dengler of Discover magazine writes that the dearth of similarly sized T. rex fossils suggests most of the dinosaurs peers didnt survive long enough to reach their full potential. As Persons concludes to Dengler, Scotty has pushed the envelope of how big we now know T. rex was."}, {"title": "How Do Scientists Know What Colors Prehistoric Animals Were?", "author": "Rachael Lallensack", "date": "March 27, 2019", "doc": "To the untrained eye, most fossils dont appear to be bursting with color. The first scientific analysis of fossil color was published only a decade ago, and until recently, determining the color palette of the prehistoric world seemed an insurmountable task. Maria McNamara, a paleontologist at University College Cork in Ireland, is trying to piece together the fossil evidence to paint a colorful picture of the past. When people think of paleontology, they often think of hard teeth and bone, but the softer parts of animals, like skin, muscle tissue and internal organs, can be preserved in the fossil record, too. Its much rarer, of course, because the squishy stuff usually rots away, but soft tissues are exactly the kind of specimens McNamara is looking for. She studies tissues from insects and vertebrates in order to envision what these critters looked like and how they interacted with their environmentswhat their predators were, where they lived, what their mating habits may have been and more. McNamara will be discussing her work to find the color remnants in fossils at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural Historys Lifes Greatest Hits Key Events in Evolution symposium on Friday, March 29, in Washington DC. Ahead of her talk, Smithsonian.com spoke to McNamara to learn more about the colors of the ancient world.   Scientifically speaking, what is color, and how is it measured? Color is simply visible light. Anything that scatters energy between the wavelengths of 400 and 700 nanometers is what scientists call visible light. The human eye is trained to perceive subtle differences in energy within that window. Other animals can see color beyond that window. For instance, birds have sensitivities to the ultraviolet light, so they can perceive shorter wavelengths of energy. Many insects can also see ultraviolet light and potentially in the infrared, which has longer wavelengths. What you call color really depends on what kind of animal you are. To put it in its simplest terms, color is a form of energy we can perceive, and different wavelengths create different colors. In what ways does color develop in nature? Color can be produced in two different ways. Many modern organisms, including animals, produce color using pigments. Pigments are chemicals that selectively absorb light of specific wavelengths. For example, plants leaves look green because the molecules in chlorophyll inside the leaves absorb all of the wavelengths in the red and the blue part of the spectrum, and theyre reflecting the greens and yellows that we can see. The most common pigment in plants is chlorophyll, but in animals, some of the most common pigments are melanins. They produce the color of our hair. They produce the brown colors in fungi, for instance, and the dark hued colors of bird feathers. We also have common pigments called carotenoids, and these are produced exclusively by plants. But many animals ingest carotenoids in their diet and they use them to color their tissues. So, for instance, the red color of a cardinal, which are common on the east coast of the United States, is produced by carotenoids, which the birds take in their diet of fruit and berries. The pink feathers of flamingos are derived from carotenoids in the algae that tiny shrimp eat, which is the birds favorite meal. But theres actually this whole different way of producing color, and thats called structural color. Structural color doesnt use pigments at all and instead uses very ornate tissue structures at the nanoscale. Basically some animals tissues will fold into highly complex structures at the nanometer levelor in other words, at same scale as the wavelength of light. Those structures affect the way light passes through biological tissues, so they can essentially filter out certain wavelengths and produce really strong colors. And actually structural colors are the brightest and the most intense colors that we get in nature. What different types of color, or different structures that produce color, do you look for when you study these fossils? When I started studying color, I was working with the structural color in fossil insects. I started off looking at these metallic insects. They showed bright blues, reds, greens and yellows, but no one had ever really studied what was producing these colorsthere was just a single study of a fragment of one piece of beetle. So I studied some 600 of these insects from many different fossil localities, and together with some collaborators, we got permission to take samples of the tiny fossils. When we did this, regardless of what species we were looking at, all of these structures in these colored insects were produced by a structure called a multilayer reflector. Microscopically, it basically looks like a sandwich with lots of really thin layers, maybe only 100 nanometers thick. Many modern insects have these in their outer shell. The more layers there are, the brighter the color thats scattered. We were interested in finding out why we werent finding other structures, such as three dimensional photonic crystals, which are tiny, complex, layered structures that interfere with light particles called photons. The structures might be twisted into a diamond structure, a cubic structure, a hexagonal structure and even more complex structures. Many modern insects and butterflies display this. For example, the modern Morpho butterfly is this fabulous blue tropical butterfly with scales that contain 3D photonic crystals. So we wondered, why did we never find these in the fossil record? Why do you think you were only seeing multilayer reflector structures in the fossils while other color producing structures exist in modern insects? We did some experimental fossilization, which is called taphonomy. We replicated the aspects of the fossilization process by allowing both multilayer reflectors and 3D photonic crystals to degrade in the lab. Both of them survived the experiment, which told us that these 3D photonic crystals had the same fossilization potential as the multilayer reflectorsso they must be in the fossil record somewhere. We started looking a few years ago, and we did report the first case of 3D photonic crystals in fossil insects. The example where we did find them in the field is very small, so in many cases they might just be overlooked. Can color change in the fossilization process? The question we encounter is whether the preserved color is the real color. We initially studied the structures chemistry by assuming that its the same as modern insectsor in other words, we assumed it would bend light the same. But when we input those values into our computer models, they didnt work. The models told us that the colors of our fossils actually had changed during the fossilization. With our experiments we were able to work out that the change was due to excess pressure and, more importantly, steady temperature. Temperature, we found, really drives color change of these structural colors because the physical structure shrinks. When studying the color of extinct plants and animals, what species leave behind the best evidence? Its not a case of particular species, its a case of getting things preserved in the right way. Most of the studies that have been done so far have been done on feathers, either feathers in birds or dinosaurs, and theyve all been preserved as carbonation compressions fossils formed in sedimentary rock under immense pressure. This is problematic because you dont preserve the parts of the feather that are responsible for the non melanin colors. In extant birds, melanin is almost ubiquitous, and the effects of melanin are modified by the presence of other pigments. So if you take again the red feathers of a cardinal, they look red but inside, they contain carotenoids and also melanosomes. If that bird feather goes through fossilization, the carotenoids will degrade and all youd be left are melanosomes, and you wouldnt know the cardinal was red. Theres a very real danger that a lot of the reconstructions weve been looking at of fossil birds and feathered dinosaurs may not be representative of the colors of the organisms as we might think. If you find evidence of melanin in fossils, it might be indicative of patterning, but not of the actual hue. So we argue then that these carbonation fossils are probably not ideal for studies of fossil color. What types of fossils preserve color best? We think we should be looking for fossils preserved in the mineral calcium phosphate. That was the case with the snake that we studied in 2016. The colors of the snake are preserved the whole skin of the snake is preserved in calcium phosphate. The beauty of calcium phosphate is that it preserves everything. The entire pigments of the skin are preserved, including the three types of pigments that produce color in modern reptiles. It preserves structural color red and yellow, and the dark color. Those kinds of fossils where youve locked everything in calcium phosphate, theyre actually a much better target for studies of fossil color than carbonation compression. So what color were the dinosaurs? We have various feathered dinosaurs that we have melanin in these color patterns for, and in modern birds, melanin coloration is modified by other pigments. These other pigments arent preserved as fossils, so we cannot be sure for now. If we found dinosaur skin that was really well preserved, we would have a good chance of reconstructing color in more detail. The problem is that most dinosaur skin is preserved as impressions. There are a number of examples where you actually retain a thin organic or mineralized film, but even though a few have been studied, none have actually yielded details of the pigments. Today, we often see bright colors as toxic warnings to predators or as a lavish display to attract a mate, or other more subtle colors to serve as camouflage. What purpose did color serve for the first colorful animals? Lots of dinosaurs we see have countershading, which is when the back and sides are darker in color and the belly is a paler color. This is a strategy used by many modern animals to help break up the body outline in strong light environments and provide camouflage. In a feathered dinosaur we studied, the tail has very striking banding on it. That type of banding is very common in animals today, and when it occurs on other areas of the body, it is typically used for camouflage. But in this specific dinosaur, it is localized to the tail. So that high color contrast in the tail in modern animals is often used in sexual signaling, so for mating displays. The fossil snake that we studied was almost certainly using color for camouflage. It had quite striking blotches along its length, and those blotches probably served again as disruptive camouflage, to break up the body outline in strong light. The fossil moth and some fossil insects we studied with structural colorswe got the sense that their colors served a dual function because they had a very striking green color. Such a color is cryptic when the insect is hiding in vegetation, but when these butterflies would have been feeding on the host plants, there would have been a sharp color contrast with the petals of the flower. Many insects use this as a warning signal to advertise that a predator is near. What new tools do we have to study soft tissues, and what can we learn that we have not been able to learn from fossils up to this point? Ten years ago, the whole notion that fossils could preserve color was hardly on the radarthere was only one study out. Twelve years ago, no one would even know that this was possible. There are several mass spectrometry techniques that look at the molecular fragments on the surface of your material, but not all fragments are diagnostic. There are chemical techniques that produce unique fragments of the melanin molecules so you cant confuse them with anything else. People are also looking at the inorganic chemistry of fossils and trying to recover supporting evidence of color. So its really important to consider the taphonomy, the tissue chemistry and the evidence of color, and one really nice way of teasing out the biology from the effects of fossilization is to do experiments.

She died with the egg still inside her, with the muck of the lake covering her body and preserving the somber scene in perpetuity. But Michael Greshko at National Geographic reports the birds misfortune is sciences gain. The fossil represents the first time an ancient bird has been found with its unhatched egg still in its body, and its teaching researchers how modern bird eggs evolved. The fossil was originally dug up by paleontologists from Chinas Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology IVPP in the mid 2000s in the Xiagou Formation in the northwest of the country. It was one of several Cretaceous era Enantiornithes fossils, which were a type of early bird that coexisted with the dinosaurs, found during those excavations. After the find, researchers put the fossil in storage, noting remnants of an unusual membrane. Last year, paleontologist Alida Bailleu, who specializes in studying fossilized soft tissue, arrived at IVPP and began looking through its fossil archives for specimens to investigate. Her team came across the deceased mother bird, which has been indentified as a new prehistoric species called Avimaia schweitzerae. According to a press release, when they extracted a bit of the unknown material, they determined that it was eggshell. Using a scanning electron microscope, the team analyzed mineral remnants associated with a form of natural waterproofing that is found in the eggshell of birds that partially bury their eggs, a behavior that Enantiornithes researchers have hypothesized about the ancient bird family. They also found the double layer of paper thin shell, indicative of the reproductive problem that killed the mother called egg binding, which occurs when the egg becomes stuck near the cloaca and the shell continues to grow, becoming too thick to ever leave the body. No signs of the embryo in the egg were found in the fossil. The research appears in the journal Nature Communications. The team also believes theyve found the presence of medullary bone, a type of temporary bone structure that facilitates calcium storage for eggshell production, in the fossil. Some paleontologists claim they have found this special type of bone in other birds as well as dinosaur fossils, but without the presence of an egg, its difficult to confirm that it is indeed a medullary bone and therefore establish early evidence of the bones presence in early avian reproduction. Because the team found the egg and possible medullary bone together, the fossil is an strong example of the link between the medullary bone and how avian reproduction evolved. The new fossils namesake Mary Schweitzer, a paleontologist at North Carolina State University who was not involved in this study, tells Greshko the link is strong. Schweitzer was part of a team that found another potential medullary bone in T. Rex in 2005. At this point, what else can it be? Schweitzer says. Id like to see chemistry done, and maybe eventually they will get to that ... but the preponderance of evidence supports it being medullary bone. Paleontologist Michael Pittman of the University of Hong Kong, who studies avian flight origins and is not associated with the new study, tells George Dvorsky at Gizmodo that this new fossil is an important one. This Mesozoic bird specimen is the only one I know of that preserves both an egg and the medullary bone, Pittman says. It provides the best evidence yet of a female early bird that was reproductively active. The fossil also provides invaluable insight into the reproduction of Enantiornithines, a diverse group of early birds that dominated the Cretaceous and hatched out of the egg running and perhaps ready to fly too. Greshko at National Geographic reports theres still more we could learn from the egg by studying its molecular structure, which could indicate what kind of texture and color the eggs had. With that information, researchers may be able to learn what kind of habitat the bird nested in."}, {"title": "Fossil Treasure Trove of Ancient Animals Unearthed in China", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "March 21, 2019", "doc": "The Cambrian was a time of vibrant, wonderful life. Fossil packed sites like the Burgess Shale in Canada have revealed the unique nature of early animals around 508 million years ago. The strange creatures found in the rock are so delicately preserved that the ancient deposit seemed like a rarity, showing the unusual appendages and body shapes of the time. In the century since the Burgess Shale discovery, however, other fossil wonderlands of similar age have been uncovered elsewhere on the planet. The latest to be recognized was found in southern China the Qingjiang Biota. In a paper published today in the journal Science, Paleontologist Dongjing Fu of Xians Northwest University and colleagues describes the Cambrian Period fossils. At 518 million years old, the collection is about 10 million years older than the Burgess Shale. The way the fossils formed, however, is similar to those in North America. Visible in high contrast as dark fossils on gray stone, the organisms of the Qingjiang Biota are preserved down to the finest details. The fossils include trilobites, jellyfish, shrimp like arthropods and even tadpole like animals from the earliest days of the vertebrate family. Dozens of these species have never been seen before. What makes the Qingjaing special compared to other Cambrian sites with soft parts preserved, such as the Burgess Shale and Chengjiang Biota in southern China, is the fact that there is over fifty percent entirely new taxa of animals and algae that are previously unknown to science, says University of Lausanne paleontologist Allison Daley. Even better, she notes, is that the fossils are of truly exceptional quality, preserving the anatomy of the species without some of the natural distortions that sometimes result from the fossilization process. It shows how we have these little windows back to the past and how finding another site can change what we know, says University of Bristol paleontologist Jakob Vinther. Some of the most beautiful specimens from the site are of soft bodied creatures that dont easily enter the geologic record. The presence of so many stunning cnidarians was an absolute pleasure to see, Daley says, referring to the jellyfish and sea anemones that thrived in this ancient ecosystem and are some of the key fossils that make the Qingjiang Biota stand out. The significance of this site is in the way it fills several gaps in knowledge about key animal groups, including cnidarians, strange invertebrates known as mud dragons and comb jellies. Representatives of all these groups are still alive today, making them some of the most ancient and successful animals in the world. This wealth of squishy bodied specimens hasnt been visible at other Cambrian sites. The diversity of cnidarians and ctenophores and sponges seems unique and therefore may give us a lot of clues to the origin and evolution of these groups that other sites couldnt, Vinther says. The seeming flash fossilization of the Qingjiang Biota preserves an entire community of species, as close as paleontologists can get to time traveling back to 518 million years ago. The fact that the assemblage of taxa is so different from other sites will also reveal the characteristics that influence what taxa live together in the same place at the same time, Daley says, and show us information about their ecological interactions. The Qingjiang Biota also adds a new wrinkle to the ongoing fossiliferous debate about the Cambrian explosion. The explosion was a dramatic diversification of life during the Cambrian Period, but paleontologists are still discussing whether the evolutionary event was a real, sudden change or if it simply looks that way because of incomplete fossil sampling. While the Qingjiang Biota doesnt necessarily resolve the debate, Daley says, it adds to the picture of amazing evolutionary radiation during the Cambrian. The fact that the Qingjiang Biota is about the same age as the nearby Chengjiang Biota, but contains many previously unknown species, indicates that the Cambrian hosted more unusual organisms than paleontologists previously imagined. The diversity of life at the time could be a signal of a much earlier flurry of evolutionary activity that gave rise to many new species preserved at sites like Qingjiang and the Burgess Shale. The study by Dongjing Fu and colleagues is a preliminary report, announcing the discovery of many species that have yet to be named and intensively studied. There may be more fossils out there as well. The researchers note that the geologic formation in which the Qingjiang Biota resides is found in other places in China and could yield additional fossils. The identities and interactions of the Qingjiang Biota creatures have yet to fully come into focus. For now, they offer a new window to a time we know little about, and, Daley says, I cant wait to see the detailed studies on these amazing fossils in the future."}, {"title": "Did Great White Sharks Drive Megalodon to Extinction?", "author": "Marissa Fessenden", "date": "February 15, 2019", "doc": "The largest shark that ever lived, the prehistoricand certainly extinctmegalodon, might have been driven to extinction by a smaller and nimbler competitor that still roams the seas today the great white shark. The giant Otodus megalodon once reached lengths of 50 feet. While not the only large shark to swim ancient seas, it was the biggest and has grabbed modern imagination. The fixation on the beast springs from a strong foundation Megalodons jaws could open wide enough to swallow two adults standing side by side, writes Josh Davis for the Natural History Museum in London, UK.  Megalodons physical length is accompanied by a long fossil record the shark reigned in the oceans for about 13 million years. Research pegged the behemoths extinction to around 2.6 million years ago. But a new study challenges that date, writes Nicolas Rivero for Quartz. Robert Boessenecker, a paleontologist at the College of Charleston in South Carolina and lead author of the new study, and his colleagues revisited various fossils of megalodon. Their new analysis, published in the journal PeerJ, pushes megalodons extinction date back about a million years earlier than previously thought. The researchers used the same dataset that earlier work had relied upon to date megladons death. But all the fossils tagged as younger than 3.6 million years had problems they had imprecise dates, had been misidentified or the dating has since been refined based on better geology methods, a press statement from the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh explains. After making extensive adjustments to this worldwide sample and statistically re analyzing the data, we found that the extinction of O. megalodon must have happened at least one million years earlier than previously determined, Boessenecker says in the statement. The new date offers a big clue as to how megalodon went extinct. It coincides with the rise of the great white shark, writes Maya Wei Haas for National Geographic. Scientists had previously tied the megalons disappearance from the fossil record to a marine extinction at the end of the Pliocene epoch, perhaps triggered by a supernova that sent harmful radiation toward earth. With the new dates, there arent any events or changes that were widespread enough to explain the megalodons die outjust the appearance of the great white shark on the scene. Nothing else is that cosmopolitan, Boessenecker tells National Geographic.  Great white sharks are smaller than the megalodon was, but they could have competed against juvenile megalodons. Other changes in the ocean at the time could have been just enough to make the difference. The megalodon was dealing with dwindling populations of the small whales they ate and shrinking into smaller, more fragmented populations, writes Melissa Cristina M\u00e1rquez for Forbes. Under those threats, the appearance of great white sharks spelled the larger predators doom. The great white shark has to survive about 10 million more years to beat megalodons record, but from a more inclusive point of view both creatures can enjoy a reputation of adaptive success. All sorts of sharks have roamed the worlds oceans for more than 350 million years.

The long necked Mnyamawamtuka moyowamkiaSwahili for animal of the Mtuka with a heart shaped tailwas found in the Mtuka, a riverbed in Tanzania, reports Jessica Boddy for Popular Science. The dino is more than just an interesting name. M. moyowamkia is a member of the appropriately named titanosaurs, a group of enormous animals. The researchers hope that figuring out how the new find relates to fossils scientists have already uncovered can reveal more about titanosaurs, how they lived and how they thrived. Titanosaurs dominated Cretaceous ecosystems all over the world at the end of the age of dinosaurs, Kristina Curry Rogers, a paleontologist at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, tells Popular Science. Rogers wasnt involved in the new study. In spite of the fact that titanosaurs are being discovered at an astonishing pace and inhabited every continent on earth, the earliest phases of their take over are still pretty mysterious. Titanosaurs first appeared about 125 million years ago, reports Will Dunham for Reuters. Before dinosaurs were wiped out 66 million years ago, the largest of the titanosaurs could grow to be 120 feet long and weigh 70 tons. The new fossil find provides a critical look at the group before the widespread diversification around the planet, Patrick OConnor, a study co author and anatomy professor at Ohio University tells Reuters. Scientists still arent sure how or why the titanosaur group grew so large. Most specimens have come from South America, writes Gemma Tarlach for Discover. So a find in Africa is exciting and has the potential to round out the titanosaur story. The researchers dug M. moyowamkia out of a cliff face above a dry river bed. Excavations started in 2004. They found teeth, parts of limbs, ribs, vertebrate and parts of the shoulders and pelvis, they report in PLOS One. The paper includes a detailed description of all the bones the team found as well as how they compare to other titanosaur fossils. As for the heart shaped tail bone, OConnor says that the vertebrae could have helped to stiffen the long tail. It was not fully grown yet, as evidenced by unfused parts of the skeleton, he tells Reuters. So, we are not sure of the maximum adult size at this point. Whatever its purpose in life, the unique anatomical feature is certainly helping the dino gain fame long after it died."}, {"title": "Prehistoric Crocodile Cousin Crushed the Bones of Its Prey Long Before T. Rex", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "February 6, 2019", "doc": "Tyrannosaurus rex was the biggest bone crusher of all time, pulverizing its prey with a spectacularly powerful bite. But the tyrant king didnt pioneer the technique of crunching on bones. Over 130 million years before T. rex walked the Earth, a relative of todays crocodiles smashed through bones with robust teeth and pulverizing jaws. Uncovered in 2007 at a Polish site called Lisowice, fossils of the 205 million year old carnivore, named Smok wawelski, were first described by Uppsala University paleontologist Grzegorz Nied\u017awiedzki and colleagues in 2012. Despite the Triassic reptiles kinship in a broad family that includes todays alligators and crocodiles, Smok which means dragon in Polish was a very different kind of predator. The animal roughly resembled the giant, flesh eating dinosaurs that would evolve millions of years later, and the chompers table scraps have revealed that Smok was adept at breaking carcasses down into splinters. That Smok was a carnivore was immediately apparent from the reptiles skeleton. The recurved, serrated teeth set in its jaws were adapted for latching into prey. But the extreme extent to which Smok consumed bone comes from new lines of evidence. Fossilized feces and petrified vomit attributed to the carnivore, recently documented by Nied\u017awiedzki and coauthors in Scientific Reports, indicate that Smok didnt just chew the fat. Matching fossil fecescalled coprolites by expertsto a particular animal is often difficult. The fossils dont come with signatures. But, in this case, the preserved droppings size, contents and location all point to Smok. It was the only big predator in the ecosystem, Nied\u017awiedzki says, noting that there are no isolated teeth, footprints or traces of another competing carnivore. The ability to look inside coprolites without damaging them allowed researchers crack the case of how this carnivore ate. We used to have to cut up coprolites in order to get a look at their contents, University of Tennessee paleontologist Stephanie Drumheller Horton says, but now CT scanning technology offers a way to peek inside without destroying the fossils. The coprolites found at the Smok fossil site in Poland contained bits of teeth from the ancient crocodile relative. Because this animal would have replaced teeth throughout its lifetime, accidentally swallowing shed or broken crowns was probably fairly common, Drumheller Horton says. Smok didnt just eat bone incidentally, though. The sheer volume of bone inside the reptiles feces indicates that Smok was purposefully consuming bone, and the way the pieces were broken provides some clues of how the animal fed. Instead of swallowing bones wholeas some modern crocodiles and birds doSmok broke down the skeletons of its prey. This was done through repeated biting, Nied\u017awiedzki says, adding that bones of other animals from the same site in Poland show repeated bites made by Smok. The petrified vomit may have something to say about the life of Smok, too. Preserved throw up pellets, or regurgitalites, are rare in the fossil record. In some cases, they indicate that a predator consumed too much hard to digest material, like bone, and so a pellet is thrown up to make room for more. But there are other reasons why an animal like Smok might expel bone. Alligators and crocodiles will throw up if they are stressed after a meal, Drumheller Horton says. They will also regurgitate food if the temperature drops. This induced vomiting helps prevent food from rotting in the stomach if digestion slows from stress or metabolic changes. While its impossible to know exactly why Smok heaved up the bone pellets that researchers study today, Drumheller Horton notes that there are several reasons why such an animal might jettison excess foodstuffs. Smok was apparently so similar to T. rex in feeding behavior that petrified poop from both carnivores contains roughly the same proportion of mashed up bone. The similarity is striking, considering Smok isnt the only non dinosaur to anticipate the anatomy or behavior of the terrible lizards that would evolve millions of years later. A mysterious Triassic creature called Triopticus had a similar dome to dinosaurs called pachycephalosaurs. Another crocodile relative called Effigia looks quite a bit like the ostrich mimic dinosaurs known as ornithomimosaurs. And a horned Triassic reptile pioneered a look that would later be adopted by horned dinosaurs like Triceratops. It almost appears that the Triassic was a period of evolutionary experimentation, Nied\u017awiedzki says. Ecosystems with complex food webs were thriving, and paleontologists are only just beginning to document the oddities that evolved during this time. In the Triassic, dinosaurs were small and meek, not yet the dominant beasts of our imaginations, while crocodile relatives and other strange reptiles ruled the planet. If an extinction event hadnt turned the tables and wiped out creatures like Smok, the age of reptiles could have completely prevented the rise and reign of the dinosaurs."}, {"title": "Pandas Weren\u2019t Always Picky Eaters", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "February 1, 2019", "doc": "Relatively speaking, the giant pandas bamboo only preference may actually be a recently acquired fad diet, a new study shows. Previous studies found that the giant panda, Ailuropoda melanoleuca, made the switch from being omnivorous to keeping a strictly bamboo diet long agowith ancestral species adding bamboo to their diet about 7 million years ago and then going bamboo exclusive about 2.4 to 2 million years ago. But new research suggests thats not the case at all Pandas turned to a bamboo only lifestyle just 5,000 to 7,000 years ago, possibly under pressure from the encroaching human population, according to a new study in the journal Current Biology. Pandas are a true black and white paradox. They have the physical structure of a carnivore and a gut that is optimized for digesting meat, but instead they chow down on bamboo. The problem is, they are not very good at digesting the stuff and dont even have the right microbes to break it down, only extracting about 20 percent of the available energy from the plant. That means to get enough energy to survive they have to eat enormous quantities of the stuff all day, every day, for 12 to 16 hours. The only remaining places that can provide that much bamboo are a few high mountain forests in western China where about 1,860 of the animals remain in the wild. Emiliano Rodriguez Mega at Nature reports that to understand exactly when pandas went full bamboo, researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences analyzed the fossilized remains of 12 ancient pandas collected at seven archaeological sites in China as well as the bone collagen from pandas that lived between the 1970s and 2000s. They also looked at the bones of other mammals living in the same region. While its not possible to figure out exactly what species of plant or animal an ancient critter ate, looking at the ratios of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in their remains can reveal the broad strokeslike whether it was eating primarily meat or plants, or if it had a varied diet. Analyzing bones can show what the creature ate in the last few years of its life, while examining tooth enamel can reveal what it ate in its first few years. And weird dietslike exclusively eating bamboocreate unique patterns of isotopes. The isotope analysis of the ancient pandas appears to show that as late as 5,000 years ago, giant pandas had a much more varied diet than their bamboo chomping descendents. Jeremy Rehm at Science News reports that when the panda isotopes were compared to other herbivores from the same time period, they were indistinguishable, meaning the pandas were chowing down on more plants than just bamboo. It has been widely accepted that giant pandas have exclusively fed on bamboo for the last two million years, co author Fuwen Wei of Chinese Academy of Sciences says in a statement. Our results showed the opposite. When, exactly, the pandas went from eating a wide variety of plants to just bamboo is difficult to pinpoint and will require finding more panda fossils. We need to get more samples from different years after 5,000 years ago, but it is hard to do this, Wei tells Genelle Weule at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Exactly why they switched to only bamboo is harder to determine. We do not know the exact reasons, Wei says. Maybe it is a complicated mix of climate change, human encroachment and species competition for resources. Zoologist Huabin Zhao of Wuhan University tells Mega at Nature that understanding why the pandas restricted their range and their diet could help modern conservationists help save the animal, which is currently listed as vulnerable by the IUCN, which manages the worlds endangered species list. If we know what kinds of changes have reduced the habitat of giant pandas, we could create better conservation strategies, Zhao says. Currently, the best conservation strategy is to provide the pandas with more land in the form of unfragmented bamboo forests with limited human encroachment. After Chinese government panda reserves were cut by almost three quarters in the 1980s, panda populations dropped by half. Since then, an increase in panda land and a massive spike in global interest in the species has helped its population to double to 1,864. In 2016, the species was downgraded from endangered to vulnerable, though threats remain, including increased habitat fragmentation and more human encroachment into the mountains where they spend long, long days nibbling their favoriteand really onlytreat."}, {"title": "Scientists Model How Prehistoric Shark Cut Through Prey With \u2018Scissor Jaws\u2019", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "January 31, 2019", "doc": "Modern sharks have impressive bites, with aquatic powerhouses such as the great white chomping into prey with rows of serrated teeth arranged in a characteristic half moon shape. But hundreds of millions of years ago, before the dawn of the dinosaurs, there lived a shark with a bite unlike any other Edestus, the scissor shark. Paleontologists have known about Edestus for over 150 years. Fossils of the fish were found in the roughly 330 million year old shale of the United States and England, most of them with preserved teeth and parts of the jaw. Since Edestus discovery in the 19th century, its jaws have stymied experts looking to understand the feeding habits of this unusual fish. Edestus two rows of teeth arent arranged in a half circle, as in most modern sharks, but rather look like a pair of toothy pinking shears. Nothing like Edestus exists today, but a new analysis of a delicate fossil has solved the mystery of how this ancient marine predator consumed its prey. The key fossil is known to experts as FMNH PF2204, although Idaho State University paleontologist Leif Tapanila calls it Ed Head. On the surface, it doesnt look like much. Collected by the late paleontologist Rainer Zangerl in the 1960s, the skull is preserved in what looks like a floor tile of black shale with a hand sized lump inside, Tapanila says. But an X ray of the specimen that Zangerl published in 2004, as well as work on another mystery fish called Helicoprion, inspired Tapanila and his colleagues to think about solving the longstanding mystery of Edestus bite. Up until the new analysis, published in The Anatomical Record, no one could agree on precisely how this fish used its distinctive, saw like teeth. Each triangular tooth was set in a curved piece of jawcalled a whorlthat jutted from the fishs mouth. Dozens of Edestus teeth and full whorls are well preserved and described, but without any context of the full jaws or cranium, previous ideas about the appearance and function are all over the map, Tapanila says. A specimen at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History inspired the idea that the jaws of this fish curved banana like outside the lips of the animal. Another recent idea suggested Edestus used its teeth to slash up and down at prey, presumably ripping them apart with mosh pit fervor, Tapanila says. With numerous theories floating around, Ed Head was able to shed some light on the mastication of Edestus. The fossil includes the teeth, jaws and skull, which Tapanila and his colleagues modeled with a CT scan to create a three dimensional representation of the animals head. We were amazed by the skull anatomy because it appears to have two joints in the jaw mechanism, Tapanila says. During a bite, the upper and lower blades of teeth snapped toward each other, and the bottom blade glided backward to the throat, slicing its prey in half. The bite and slice technique of Edestus has never been seen before. So far as I know, this is a unique type of feeding, says Humboldt State University paleontologist Allison Bronson. There were other whorl toothed sharkslike the buzzsaw jaw Helicoprion that Tapanila and colleagues previously studiedbut so far, Edestus appears to be unique in having a bite and slice mechanism. Im always excited by Dr. Tapanila and colleagues use of innovate modeling techniques to address these longstanding mysteries of paleoichthyology, the study of fossil fish Bronson says. Imagining Edestus in action could certainly inspire some b movie depictions of a frightening predator in the deep. The jaw of Edestus seems to be primarily developed to quickly and fatally amputate its prey, snapping them in half, and presumably picking up the falling pieces after the victim was subdued, Tapanila says. The fact that decapitated and de finned fish chunks were found in the same deposits as Edestus seems to support the idea. Why Edestus and related fish like Helicoprion evolved their unprecedented bites is the next mystery for paleontologists to sink their teeth into. While cautioning that the idea is speculative, Tapanila suggests that the proliferation of meaty preysuch as ancient relatives of squid and other fishmight have had something to do with the appearance of slicing sharks like Edestus. For now, though, one thing is for sure Despite being extinct for about 330 million years, Edestus has never looked sharper."}, {"title": "Studying the History of Life on Earth Keeps This Paleontologist Optimistic", "author": "Rachael Lallensack", "date": "January 30, 2019", "doc": "Studying the history of life on Earth, as paleontologist Nick Pyenson does, instills a certain level on optimism in a person.

Rex", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "January 21, 2019", "doc": "Dinosaurs tend to dominate our vision of the past. As large and imposing as they were in life, they loom even larger in our imaginations. But much more than just the terrible lizards lived and thrived during the Mesozoic era, and some of the creatures that lived alongside the dinosaurs actually bear a striking resemblance to the animals of today. Sharks, for example, are some of the most successful creatures to ever live. Their fossil record stretches back about 400 million years and includes ancient species both strange and familiar. A new finding adds to the long lived legacy of these marine predators. Fossil shark teeth were recently discovered alongside the bones of the most famous and complete T. rex skeleton ever found, helping to fill out a more detailed picture of life during the last days of the dinosaurian reign. The tiny teeth, petrified tidbits about the size of a pinhead, look straight out of an 1980s videogame. They took a circuitous route to discovery, which started with the excavation of the nearly complete Tyrannosaurus known as Sue back in 1990. As the tyrannosaurs bones were removed from the ground, the encasing rock, called matrix, was left around the bones to keep them safe until more detailed prep work could be carried out. Chicagos Field Museum, where Sue resides today, saved the matrix for future sifting and study. Almost three decades later, those efforts yielded the tiny teeth of a shark that swam upstream in rivers to live in Sues neck of the woods. This shark lived at the same time as Sue the T. rex, it was part of the same world, said Pete Makovicky, the Field Museums curator of dinosaurs and one of the authors of a study describing the new species, in a press release. Most of its body wasnt preserved, because sharks skeletons are made of cartilage, but we were able to find its tiny fossilized teeth. North Carolina University paleontologist Terry Gates led the work to characterize the new shark species in the Journal of Paleontology. An appropriate name for the ancient shark was immediately apparent to the researchers. Each of the small, triangular teeth look like the persistent space invaders in the 1981 arcade classic Galaga. Thus, Gates and colleagues named the shark Galagadon nordquistae, with the species name also honoring museum volunteer Karen Nordquist for finding the first fossilized tooth. It was so tiny, you could miss it if you werent looking really carefully, Nordquist said in a press release. To the naked eye, it just looks like a little bump, you have to have a microscope to get a good view of it. Based on comparisons with other fossil shark teeth, the team proposes that Galagadon belonged to a major shark family called orectolobiformes, or carpet sharks. DePaul University paleobiologist Kenshu Shimada agrees with this identification. Galagadon, he says, serves as another example of the diversification of this shark group not only in oceans worldwide, but also in the freshwater systems in the terrestrial environments near the end of the so called Age of Reptiles. While only the teeth of Galagadon are known so far, their shape suggests that the living animal would have looked something like todays bamboo sharks, a subset of carpet sharks found in the warm waters of the Indo Pacific. What has intrigued paleontologists about Galagadon, though, is what the shark can reveal about the world that Sue stomped around in. The new study, including the recognition of the new species, sheds light on the complex evolutionary history of the freshwater system that existed in North America when T. rex roamed the Earth, Shimada says. Even though dinosaurs often dominate the spotlight, its often the meeker species that help paleontologists reconstruct what ancient environments were really like. Smaller animals such as frogs, turtles and fish can help narrow down the details of ancient habitats like climate and systems of waterways. Until now, it seemed that the body of Sue was deposited in a lake that had been created by a nearly dried up river. It was thought to be a relatively self contained habitat. But the presence of a shark species only known in ocean environments indicates that the river was likely connected to the sea, allowing Galagadon and other species to swim inland. Without the shark teeth, paleontologists would have missed this watery connection. Whether Galagadon moved in formation like its video game namesakes, though, will have to wait for future finds."}, {"title": "Scientists Used a Robot to Study How Prehistoric Lizards Walked", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "January 16, 2019", "doc": "Paleontologists face a constant dilemma. The organisms that inspire their scientific attention are long dead, impossible to watch in life. Sci fi solutions like bringing species back from extinction or time travel arent available to assist. But by combining exceptional fossils with robotics, a team of researchers has reconstructed how one of our distant, lizard like relatives walked tall. A fortuitous pairing of fossils provided a place to start. At first glance, the 300 million year old Orobates pabsti might look like a chunky lizard. In actuality, this animal from the Permian period is what experts know as a stem amniotea vertebrate thats part of the evolutionary lineage between amphibians, which reproduce in the water, and the last common ancestor of mammals and reptiles, which lay eggs on land. And what makes Orobates stand out is that fossil skeletons of this animal have been found with tracks the creatures made in life. The combination of skeletons and tracks made by Orobates is exceptionally rare in the fossil record. Most tracks are found without any bones associated with them, making it difficult to tell exactly what species made the footprints. Orobates is an exception, allowing details of how the animal walked to be directly tied back to the anatomy of the skeleton. This constitutes a very rare track trackmaker association, especially considering the age of the fossils, says John Nyakatura, a biomechanics expert at Humboldt University of Berlin. Finding the skeleton along with the tracks presents an exciting opportunity for paleontologists, as Orobates sits at an important juncture in lifes evolutionary backstory. Orobates can be considered a key fossil for the understanding of vertebrate evolution since it is a very close cousin of the last common ancestors of mammals, reptiles and birds, Nyakatura says. Therefore, Orobates represents the creatures in between the first vertebrates to drag themselves onto land and the lizard like animals who led full time terrestrial lives. In a new Nature study, Nyakatura and his colleagues combined fossils, studies of living animals, and hardware to build a robotic replica of Orobates, called OroBOT. With a walking robot to take this long extinct animal through its paces, the researchers were able to open the black box of inference, Nyakatura says, and determine the most likely way that Orobates moved. Biomechanics experts have used this approach before. The Pleurobot, designed to study how salamanders move, demonstrated that robotics can provide insights into the anatomy of living creatures. OroBOT takes the same logic back through Deep Time, drawing from studies of how salamanders, skinks, iguanas and caimans get around. Nyakatura and his team gave their robotic Orobates different stances and gaits to measure the resulting footprint patterns and then compared the results to the fossilized tracks left by the living animal hundreds of millions of years ago. We first studied the locomotion of extant species in great detail to get a better understanding of the mechanical properties of sprawling tetrapod locomotion, Nyakatura says. These investigations allowed the researchers to identify biomechanical patterns which were applied to their models of tetrapod movement. The fossil footprints acted as a check on the computer simulations, and the motion of the OroBOT used the simulations to match the pattern of the footprints. The approach is comprehensive, transparent and explicitly evidence based, NYIT paleontologist Julia Molnar says. I think that many other researchers in this field will adopt aspects of their methodology. As it turns out, the way modern caimans move is a good analogue for Orobates. The prehistoric ancestor to lizards held its body off the ground on flexed limbs, with a slight side to side motion as it walked. This type of movement differs from what paleontologists expected. The predecessors of Orobates, Molnar says, are usually characterized as salamander like in their locomotion, fully sprawling and maybe dragging their bellies on the ground. While it may seem like a slight shift in behavior, lifting the belly off the ground while walking represents a major change from partially aquatic animals, which drag their bodies almost like they are swimming on land, and animals that evolved to walk primarily on solid ground. Other researchers previously assumed that the advanced locomotion that we inferred for Orobates only arose after the origin of amniotes, Nyakatura says, but the new results indicate that these more specialized ways on moving around on land evolved much earlier. The mechanics of the OroBOT are specifically keyed to Orobates, but the research demonstrates how robotics could help unlock secrets during a critical time in lifes history. The result of the new study, Molnar says, does suggest that stem amniotes werent restricted to fully sprawling postures, and there may have been a wide variety of postures and gaits the different animals used in different situations. Between species tied to the water and those that spent their lives entirely on land, shuffling between the aquatic and terrestrial realms, creatures like Orobates could really strut their stuff."}, {"title": "What Is a Shark Tooth Doing in the Neck of a Flying Pterosaur?", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "December 21, 2018", "doc": "In 1965, archaeologists working in the Smoky Hill Chalk region of Kansas discovered the fossil of a large Pteranodon, a pterosaur or flying reptile that soared through the air during the Late Cretaceous Period. Pteranodon remains are quite common in the fossil record some 1,100 specimens have been found, more than any other prehistoric winged reptile. But there was something unusual about this particular specimen it had a shark tooth lodged against its neck vertebrae. Now, as Stephanie Pappas reports for Live Science, researchers have taken a closer look at the fossil to try and determine how the tooth came to be embedded in the Pteranodon remains. And the results of their inquiry, published in Peer J, suggest that this great predator of the sky may have fallen victim to a great predator of the sea. The area where the Pteranodon fossil was discovered is a marine deposit created by the Western Interior Seaway, a huge waterway that once stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada. After it was excavated, the Pteranodon was stored at the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum and eventually put on permanent display, shark tooth and all. It was a big creature, with a wingspan stretching more than 16 feet, and it weighed around 100 pounds. Like other members of its species, it had a crested skull and fed by catching fish in its pelican like jaws. The shark tooth, according to the study authors, belonged to the species Cretoxyrhina mantelli, a large and fearsome predator that stalked the Late Cretaceous seas. These sharks could grow as long as 23 feet, but the owner of the lost tooth was only around eight feet in length, based on the size of the tooth in question. When trying to figure out why the remains of two distinct animals were intertwined in the fossil record, the researchers had to consider the possibility that they were pulled together by the seas currents. But Michael Habib, study co author and a paleontologist at the University of Southern California, tells Pappas that sediment in the area suggests the waters were relatively calm millions of years ago. Additionally, the study authors write, the spatial relationship between the tooth and the vertebra is complex and intimate, and unlike that expected to have occurred by chance association. Other ancient shark species have also been known to feast on flying pteroaurs earlier this year, a series of bite marks from the prehistoric Squalicorax shark were found on the wing bone of a Pteranodon. The researchers thus suspected that the Cretoxyrhina mantelli shark had taken a hefty bite out of the pteranodon, losing its tooth in the process. It is possible, they study authors say, that the shark was simply scavenging on a pteranodon carcass. But it is also possible that the pteranodon was actively hunted. Todays sharks are known to dramatically breach the water while pursuing prey, but Habib tells Atlas Obscuras Matthew Taub that the ancient Cretoxyrhina mantelli probably didnt have to leap out of the sea to catch the pteranodon mid flight. Pteranodons are thought to have hunted by diving after fish or scooping them up from an alighted position on the water. The winged reptiles feeding habits, in other words, brought it within range of hungry sharks lurking below the surface. According to the study authors, an unsuspecting pteranodon would have been no match for even a mid sized Cretoxyrhina mantelli. We have little doubt that such predators could subdue these pterosaurs if they caught them, they write. Though it is impossible for the researchers to come up with a definitive story of how the pteranodon met its end, the implications of their hypothesis are important to the study of the species. It is rare to find signs of predation on Pteranodon skeletons only seven of the more than 1,000 known specimens show evidence of predator prey interaction. The new study also suggests that there may be parallels between the hunting behaviors of todays sharks, which are known to prey on sea birds, and those that swam through ancient waters. Understanding the ecology of these animals is important to understanding life on Earth through time, Habib says. We now know sharks were hunting flying animals as long ago as 80 million years."}, {"title": "Trove of Well-Preserved Dinosaur Footprints Unearthed Along Sussex Coast", "author": "Meilan Solly", "date": "December 18, 2018", "doc": "Some 100 to 145 million years ago, dinosaurs including the plant eating Iguanodon, long necked Diplodocus and club tailed Ankylosaurus roamed the coast of what is now East Sussex, England, scattering imprints of their unique gaits across the regions terrain. But over the millennia that followed, these footprints were obscured by the build up of sandstone and mudstone cliffsa phenomenon that simultaneously masked the impressive array of preserved prints and ensured their survival to this day.  Now, Rhys Blakely writes for The Times, researchers from the University of Cambridge say theyve discovered more than 85 fossilized footprints left by at least seven of these prehistoric dinosaur species. The imprints, which were unearthed by winter storm driven coastal erosion over the past four years, range in size from less than 2 centimeters to around 60 centimeters, or two feet, across. They are so well preserved that details such as skin, scales and claws can be readily seen.  The scientists find, newly detailed in the journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology, reportedly represents the most detailed and diverse collection of Cretaceous fossils ever discovered in Great Britain. The Cretaceous Period began with the close of the Jurassic Period about 145.5 million years ago and ended with a mass extinction event some 65 million years ago.  Although the area surrounding Hastings, a coastal town in East Sussex, has long been touted as a promising dig site for fossil huntersJosh Gabbatiss of The Independent notes that the first known Iguanodon was discovered there in 1825, with the first confirmed example of fossilized dinosaur brain tissue following in 2016the footprints are the first of their kind to be unearthed in 25 years. According to BBC News, earlier finds were far less varied and detailed oftentimes, such discoveries consisted of dinosaur bone fragments rather than whole footprints. Lead author Anthony Shillito, a PhD student in Cambridges Department of Earth Sciences, tells Sarah Collins of Cambridge that whole body dinosaur fossils are incredibly rare. As he explains, Usually you only get small pieces, which dont tell you a lot about how that dinosaur may have lived. A collection of footprints like this helps you fill in some of the gaps and infer things about which dinosaurs were living in the same place at the same time. The Times Blakely reports that some of the Iguanodon prints found occur in groups, suggesting the sizable herbivores traveled in herds. Other more isolated marks point toward creatures that adopted solitary lifestylesfor example, the Ankylosaurus, a large armored dinosaur with a distinctive club shaped tail. The species represented by the fossils range in size from relatively tiny carnivorous theropods, which left footprints measuring about 10 inches long and stood just taller than an average human, to members of the enormous sauropod family, which includes the up to 15 ton, 72 foot long Brontosaurus. In an interview with Cambridges Collins, study co author Neil Davies notes that the prints were likely left near a Cretaceous Period water source, as preservation requires a specific kind of environment The ground needs to be sticky enough so that the footprint leaves a mark, Davies says, but not so wet that it gets washed away. You need that balance in order to capture and preserve them. Davies and Shillito hope to unearth more footprints this winter, but as Shillito tells CBC Radios Carol Off, developers recently finished building cedar fencing around the area, lowering the chances of storm triggered coastal erosion. It obviously is a good thing to protect the homes of the people that are living near the cliff tops, Shillito concludes, but from a selfish, scientific point, the downside is that we might not see any new prints coming out of the cliffs for awhile."}, {"title": "Neanderthal Genes Influence Contemporary Humans\u2019 Skull Shape, Brain Size", "author": "Meilan Solly", "date": "December 14, 2018", "doc": "Neanderthals may have gone extinct some 40,000 years ago, but thanks to long ago species interbreeding, their genes live on in modern humans.  The implications of this genetic inheritance remain largely unclear, although previous studies have proposed links with disease immunity, hair color and even sleeping patterns. Now, Carl Zimmer reports for The New York Times, a study recently published in Current Biology offers yet another example of Neanderthals influence on Homo sapiens Compared to individuals lacking Neanderthal DNA, carriers are more likely to have slightly elongated, rather than rounded, brains.  This tendency makes sense given Neanderthals distinctive elongated skull shape, which Science magazines Ann Gibbons likens to a football, as opposed to modern humans more basketball shaped skulls. It would be logical to assume this stretched out shape reflects similarly protracted brains, but as lead author Philipp Gunz of Germanys Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology tells Live Sciences Charles Q. Choi, brain tissue doesnt fossilize, making it difficult to pinpoint the underlying biology of Neanderthal skulls.  To overcome this obstacle, Gunz and his colleagues used computed tomography CT scanning to generate imprints of seven Neanderthal and 19 modern human skulls interior braincases. Based on this data, the team established a globularity index capable of measuring how globular rounded or elongated the brain is. Next, Dyani Lewis writes for Cosmos, the researchers applied this measure to magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans of around 4,500 contemporary humans of European ancestry, and then compared these figures to genomic data cataloguing participants share of Neanderthal DNA fragments.  Two specific genes emerged in correlation with slightly less globular heads, according to The New York Times Zimmer UBR4, which is linked to the generation of neurons, and PHLPP1, which controls the production of a neuron insulating sleeve called myelin. Both UBR4 and PHLPP1 affect significant regions of the brain, including the part of the forebrain called the putamen, which forms part of the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. As Sarah Sloat explains for Inverse, the basal ganglia influences cognitive functions such as skill learning, fine motor control and planning, while the cerebellum assists in language processing, motor movement and working memory.  In modern human brains, PHLPP1 likely produces extra myelin in the cerebellum UBR4 may make neurons grow faster in the putamen. Comparatively, Sciences Gibbons notes, Neanderthal variants may lower UBR4 expression in the basal ganglia and reduce the myelination of axions in the cerebellumphenomena that could contribute to small differences in neural connectivity and the cerebellums regulation of motor skills and speech, the studys lead author Simon Fisher of the Netherlands Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics tells Gibbons .  Still, the effects of such gene variations are probably negligible in living humans, merely adding a slight, barely discernible elongation to the skull.   Brain shape differences are one of the key distinctions between ourselves and Neanderthals, Darren Curnoe, a paleoanthropologist from Australias University of New South Wales who was not involved in the study, tells Cosmos, and very likely underpins some of the major behavioural differences between our species.  In an interview with The New York Times, Fisher adds that the evolution of UBR4 and PHLPP1 genes could reflect modern humans development of sophisticated language, tool making and similarly advanced behaviors.  But, Gunz is quick to point out, the researchers are not issuing a decisive statement on the genes controlling brain shape, nor the effects of such genes on modern humans carrying fragments of Neanderthal DNA I dont want to sound like Im promoting some new kind of phrenology, he tells Cosmos. Were not trying to argue that brain shape is under any direct selection, and brain shape is directly related to behaviour at all."}, {"title": "We Still Don\u2019t Know Why the Reign of the Dinosaurs Ended", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "December 14, 2018", "doc": "The reason our planet lost the terrible lizards of eras long past may seem self evident. About 66 million years ago, an asteroid came screaming out of the sky and smacked into what is now the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula of Mexico. The devastation that followed was unprecedented, with tsunamis, an overheated atmosphere, darkened skies, a terrible cold snap, and other apocalyptic ecological events clearing away an estimated seventy five percent of known life on Earth. Paleontologists know this catastrophe as the KPg extinction event because it marks the transition from the Cretaceous into the Paleogene period of Earths history. But even though it has been studied constantly, the details of this event still puzzle experts. The case wasnt closed with the recognition of the impact crater in the 1990s, and exactly how the extinction played outwhat differentiated the living from the deadcontinues to inspire paleontologists to dig into the cataclysm of the Cretaceous. To better understand the full story, researchers are pulling back from the moment of impact to examine the broader patterns of life at the time. Dinosaurs were not living in a stable and lush Mesozoic utopia, nor were they the only organisms around at the timefar from it. The world was changing around them as it always had. As the Cretaceous drew to a close, sea levels were dropping, the climate was trending toward a cooler world, and a part of prehistoric India called the Deccan Traps was bubbling with intense volcanic activity. Sorting through how these changes affected life on Earth is no simple task, particularly after the cataclysmic meteorite mixed things up in the rock record, but paleontologists are sifting through the wreckage to better understand what happened. In order to get an idea of what happened in the wake of the asteroid impact, we need solid baseline data on what rates of background extinction were like before the KPg took place, Natural History Museum paleontologist Paul Barrett says. A moment of catastrophe can only make sense within the broader context of life before and after. This would make the difference between the cataclysmic events at Chicxulub being either the primary cause of the extinction or merely the coup de grace that finished off an ecosystem whose resilience had been gradually worn away. While the KPg extinction was a global crisis, how it played out at various locales around the planet is largely unknown. The amount of information at any given location depends on how well the relevant rock layers are preserved and how accessible they are to scientists. Some of the best exposures happen to be located in western North America, where theres a continuous sequence of sedimentary layers recording the end of the Cretaceous straight through to the beginning of the Paleogene. These rocks offer before and after shots of the extinction, and its these exposures that has allowed Royal Saskatchewan Museum paleontologist Emily Bamforth to investigate what was happening in the 300,000 years leading up to the explosive close of the Cretaceous. Looking at the geologic record of southwest Saskatchewan, Bamforth says, local conditions such as the frequency of forest fires and the characteristics of a particular habitat were as important as what was happening on a global scale when determining patterns of ancient biodiversity. I think this is an important message to keep in mind when thinking of causes of the extinction, Bamforth says. Each different ecosystem could have had its own smaller scale biodiversity drivers that were in operation before the extinction, which underlay the big, global factors. What was good for turtles, amphibians, plants, dinosaurs and other organisms in one place might not have been beneficial in another, underscoring that we cant comprehend global shifts without the foundation of local diversity. Ecosystems are complicated things, and I think that is worth keeping in mind when considering the cause and duration of the mass extinction, Bamforth says. As far as Saskatchewan goes, the ecological community at the time leading up to the extinction was like a big game of Jenga. The tower remains standing, but factors like climate change are slowly pulling blocks out from it, weakening the system and making it vulnerable, Bamforth says. The constantly shifting ecological stability made major upsetslike an asteroid striking at the wrong place, at the wrong timeespecially disastrous. This picture of shifting ecosystems inverts the focus of the KPg disaster. While the reason non avian dinosaurs and other organisms died off always grabs our attention, its been harder for scientists to determine why the survivors were able to pass through to the next chapter of lifes history. Species that survived the impact were typically small, semi aquatic or made burrows, and able to subsist on a variety of foods, but there are some key contradictions. There were some small non avian dinosaurs that had these advantages and still went extinct, and many reptiles, birds and mammals died out despite belonging to broader groups that persisted. The badger sized mammal Didelphodon didnt make it, for example, nor did the ancient bird Avisaurus, among others. This is something I struggle to explain, Barrett says. Generally speaking, smaller dinosaurs and other animals should have had better chances at survival than their larger relatives, but this was not always the case. Pat Holroyd of the University of California Museum of Paleontology likens these investigations to what happens in the wake of airline accidents. They go in and they gather all the data and they try to figure out, Well, ok, why did the people in the tail section survive, and the people in the other parts of the plane didnt make it? Holroyd says. And while such disasters may be singular events with unique causes, its still possible to look at multiple incidents collectively to identify patterns and inform what we may think of as a singular event. As far as the KPg extinction goes, the patterns are still emerging. Holroyd estimates that much of the relevant research about which species survived the impact has only been published or uploaded to the Paleobiology Database in the last decade. This new information allowed Holroyd and colleagues to study patterns of turnoverhow long species persisted on land and in associated freshwater habitatslong before and after the asteroid impact. The teams findings were presented earlier this fall at the annual Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Some of the patterns were familiar. Fish, turtles, amphibians and crocodylians all generally fared better than strictly terrestrial organisms. People have been observing this pattern since at least the 50s, and probably before, Holroyd says. But the resilience of waterbound species had never been quantified in detail before, and the new analysis is revealing that the solution to the extinction pattern puzzle may have been right in front of us all along. The surprise, Holroyd found, was that the difference between the survivors and the extinct of the KPg event mimicked a pattern that has held true for tens of millions of years before and after the asteroid impact. Species living on land, particularly large species, tend not to persist as long as those living in freshwater environments. Terrestrial species often go extinct at a greater rate than those in aquatic environments even without a massive catastrophe to take them out of the picture. Species that lived in and around freshwater habitats appear to have persisted longer even when there wasnt a crisis, and when the extinction at the end of the Cretaceous struck in full force, these organisms had an advantage over their purely terrestrial neighbors. But even in their relatively safe aquatic environments, everything wasnt peachy for water faring animals. Holroyd notes that Cretaceous turtles, for example, lost fifty percent of their diversity globally, although only about twenty percent in the more localized area of western North America, further underscoring the importance of understanding local versus global patterns. Even lineages that can be considered survivors still suffered losses and may not have bounced back to their former glory. Marsupial mammals, for example, survived the mass extinction as a group but had their diversity and abundance drastically cut back. How local ecosystems were affected by these changes is the next step toward understanding how the extinction event affected the world. Holroyd points to the familiar three horned face Triceratops as an example. This dinosaur was ubiquitous across much of western North America at the end of the Cretaceous and was clearly a major component of its ecosystem. These animals were the bison of their time, and, given how large herbivores alter their habitats through grazing and migration, the extinction of Triceratops undoubtedly had major implications for ecosystems recovering in the wake of the Cretaceous catastrophe. Plants that may have relied on Triceratops to disperse seeds would have suffered, for example, whereas other plants that were trampled down by the dinosaurs might have grown more freely. How these ecological pieces fit, and what they mean for lifes recovery after the extinction, have yet to fully come into focus. The western interior of North America gives us our only detailed window on what happened to life on land during the KPg extinction, but its totally unclear if this was typical, Barrett says. We dont know much about how the intensity of the extinction varied around the world, especially in locations that were geographically distant from the asteroid strike. It seems unlikely that a one size fits all model would be responsible for cutting down organisms as different from each other as Edmontosaurus on land and coil shelled ammonites in the seas, among so many other species lost to the Cretaceous. Research in Europe, South America, Asia and Australia is just beginning to form the basis of a much sought after global picture of the most famous extinction event in history. Its like one gigantic jigsaw puzzle that weve started to turn up more of the pieces to, Bamforth says. The resulting picture of this critical moment in Earths history will only be revealed in time."}, {"title": "Early Mammals Were Thought to Be Small and Unseen in the Age of Dinosaurs. An Elephant-Sized Fossil Complicates That Story", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "November 26, 2018", "doc": "During the age of the dinosaurs, the story often told is that the thunder lizards ruled the earth, growing to the size of cars and busses while the ancestors of mammals and other animals were tiny little insect eating fuzzballs, scurrying around during the night to avoid the reptilian teeth. But the fossil of an African elephant sized creature found in southern Poland upends that narrative, reports Gretchen Vogel at Science magazine. The beast, named Lisowicia bojani, looked something like a cross between rhinoceros and a turtle, weighing in at nine tons. The creature is a dicynodont, one of the first groups of animals to eat plants. Its also part of a broader group of creatures called synapsids, which includes the direct ancestors of mammals, making it something of a cousin to the earliest mammal ancestors, or proto mammals. The most intriguing thing about the creature, however, is that it dates to the Late Triassic period about 201 to 240 million years ago when dinosaurs first began their reign. It was believed that by that period most other creatures had shrunk in size to hide from the giants, including dicynodonts, which maxed out at the size of a dog, but L. bojani shows thats not the case. The research appears in the journal Science. Stephen Brusatte, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh not involved in the study, tells George Dvorsky at Gizmodo that the find is a big deal. Before these giant bones were discovered, you would have been called crazy if you ever suggested there were giant, elephant sized mammal cousins living alongside some of the very first dinosaurs, he says. We used to think that after the end Permian extinction 252 million years ago, when some 90 95 percent of all species went extinct, mammals and their relatives retreated to the shadows while dinosaurs rose up and grew to enormous sizes. Thats the story I tell my students in my lectures. But this new discovery throws a wrench into that simple tale. Since 2005, researchers have been pulling fossil bones out of a clay pit in Lisowice, Poland, and in 2008, they found a 22 inch dicynodont femur, which was their first hints that big animals were in the pit. The latest find included a considerably larger 31 inch femur, one of 1,000 bones uncovered during 11 years of fieldwork at the site. In total, reports John Wenz at Popular Mechanics, the team found about 70 percent of the animals bones, giving them incredible insight into the beast. Fossils found along with the 8.5 foot tall, 15 foot long dicynodont indicate that it likely lived on a wide, flat riverside eating seed ferns and early tree like plants called Brachyphyllum. The team also found the fossils of tiny shrew like proto mammals that would have scurried below its feet and fossils from predatory dinosaurs in the same location. The fossil raises lots of questions, and researchers arent even sure if the animal they found is a fully grown since the bones didnt show signs of slowing growth, meaning there could be even larger specimen out there. It raises questions about why animals in this period grew so ginormous, and why the dinos eventually won out. The discovery of Lisowicia changes our ideas about the latest history of dicynodonts, mammal Triassic relatives, co author Tomasz Sulej of the Polish Academy of Sciences says in a press release. It also raises far more questions about what really make them and dinosaurs so large. One prevailing theory is that sauropods and other huge dinosaurs evolved their massive size to avoid getting eaten by carnivorous predators, something that may have been at play with L. bojani as well, reports Vogel at Science. The team hopes to look next in Russia and Ukraine to see if there is more evidence that other massive dicynodonts once walked the earth."}, {"title": "How a Changing Climate May Have Killed Off the Marsupial Lion", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "November 21, 2018", "doc": "Deep in the Australian Outback, the locals will tell you, a legendary beast roams the bush, preying on the unprepared and the unawares. This mythical creature, the drop bear, is a ravenous variant of the koala that has developed a taste for flesh rather than leaves. And while the drop bear itself doesnt exist, it does have a real life counterpart in a predatory marsupial of the past. Over 46,000 years ago, Australia was home to Thylacoleo, a distant cousin of wombats, kangaroos and other marsupials. But unique among this subclass of mammals, Thylacoleo preyed on other animals for its food, and so paleontologists know the ancient creature as the marsupial lion. But why doesnt this impressive carnivore still prowl the Australian wilds? A new analysis of the predators teeth, carried out by Vanderbilt University paleontologist Larisa DeSantis and presented at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology annual meeting last month, offers some new clues. The initial aim of this study was to figure out the paleobiology of this animal, DeSantis says. Despite being known to scientists since 1859 and having various studies of its anatomy carried out, relatively little is known about how this predator hunted, ate its prey and otherwise interacted with its surrounding environment. It turns out, the marsupial lions teeth were key to solving some of these mysteries. The cheek teeth of Thylacoleo are very distinctive. They are more square than triangular, having the appearance of meat cleavers that slid past each other to shear through flesh. Pits and scratches on the teeth, called microwear, are tied to different foods and feeding behaviors that can help narrow down the animals diet. DeSantis also looked at stable isotope signaturesa version of you are what you eat, DeSantis says, in which chemical signatures from particular food sources get taken up and preserved in tissues like teeth and bone. It turns out that Thylacoleo lived up to its name. The microwear on the analyzed fossil teeth showed damage patterns most similar to modern day lions. Translating this to diet, it means that Thylacoleo didnt avoid chewing on bone as assiduously as cheetahs do, but it wasnt a bone crusher like the spotted hyena. Thylacoleo came out somewhere in between, mostly preferring to feed on flesh but sometimes chewing onor throughthe bones of its prey. People tended to see it as big, bad carnivore, can eat anything it wants, says Brown University paleontologist Christine Janis. This analysis confirms that it was more of a selective meat eater, and probably not much of a scavenger. Based upon the isotope data and other lines of evidence, such as where Thylacoleo bones have been found with other fossils, DeSantis also hypothesizes that this carnivore was an ambush predator that preferred relatively wooded environments, offering plenty of cover. In the old forests of Australia, Thylacoleo could stalk ancient, giant kangaroos like Protemnodon. The trouble for the predator all started when climate change altered the local habitat. What drove some of Australias megafauna to extinction is a fiercely debated question just as it is with Ice Age extinctions elsewhere around the world. Some experts place the blame on newly arrived humans, who hunted and used fire to clear the landscape, killing off many large and iconic species. Others point to climate change, noting dramatic shifts that, in this case, made Australia much more arid and denuded forests that many species relied upon. If DeSantis and her team are correct that Thylacoleo relied on the forest for cover to stalk its prey, then the desertification of Australia would have stripped away the marsupial lions cover, leading to its demise. I think that climate is more important than people have been thinking. The extreme aridity of present day Australia is probably relatively recent, Janis says. More desert like conditions altered Australia from about 300,000 years ago onward. Given what we now know about the diet of Thylacoleo and its preferred habitat, harsh climate shifts made all the difference for this carnivore. Its an ambush hunter, its eating prey from these forests, its postcranial anatomy indicates its pouncing from trees or some sort of cover, DeSantis says, and the loss of forest cover would have directly affected this carnivores ability to pounce upon its preferred prey, not to mention that there would be less prey to stalk in these environments. With aridification, this animal was particularly vulnerable to extinction, DeSantis says. The tale of this lost predator may have lessons for today, as dramatic climate shifts driven by humans continue to alter habitats around the world. Thylacoleo, the real drop bear of history, likely wont be the last apex hunter to fall along with its environment."}, {"title": "Weasel-Like Fossils Reveal Evolutionary Clues of the First Mammals", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "November 16, 2018", "doc": "We tend to think of paleontology as an epic quest into the desert to recover pristine fossils, where groundbreaking discoveries are made by sun singed explorers who stumble across the full skeletons of long extinct behemoths. But this picture of fossil science isnt how many important discoveries come to light. Sometimes stunning finds remain secret, even from scientists, until samples make it back to the lab. Such is the case with a distant protomammal relative of ours who was found with an entire litter of babies. University of Texas at Austin graduate student Eva Hoffman detailed the discovery at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in Albuquerque last month, and the findings have also been published in Nature. The story of the special specimen goes back to 2000, Hoffman says. In that year, her advisor Timothy Rowe was searching the 185 million year old rock of Arizona for skeletons of a peculiar animal called Kayentatherium. This dog sized animal was an ancient cousin of ours, belonging to a group called tritylodonts that has been associated with the evolution of the earliest mammals. Among the finds during the 2000 field season was a Kayentatherium skeleton that time hadnt treated very kindly. The bones of the skeleton had fallen out of articulation, Hoffman says, and the quality of the bone wasnt ideal for analysis. Nevertheless, that years expedition collected the fossil and some of the surrounding stone for further study. Nine years later, the secret of this skeleton finally became known. In 2009, preparator Sebastian Eggberts held up part of the stone surrounding the Kayentatherium skeleton and noticed a tiny jaw. The itty bitty fossil looked just like the jaw of the adult, and researchers soon realized that there were dozens of baby Kayentatherium fossils contained within the rock samples. While we can never be 100 percent certain of the association between the adult and offspring, it seems like the most reasonable interpretation in this case, says University of Washington paleontologist Christian Sidor. The fact that Kayentatherium and its kin are thought to have been digging animals, Sidor adds, could mean that the adult and babies were buried together in some kind of den. Preparing the fossil by mechanical means was out of the question once the babies were discovered, lest any tiny bones be accidentally destroyed. Rowes lab started making digital scans of the fossil block to see what else might be inside, which became Hoffmans project in 2016. When she was done, she counted the remains of 38 baby Kayentatherium alongside the adult. This was quite a surprise. Previous research emphasized how Kayentatherium and its relatives had evolved to become rather mammal like, Hoffman says, sharing traits with the first shrew like mammals that appeared about 160 million years ago. But such a large clutch size fits a more reptilian way of reproducing than the typically mammalian method of having smaller litters which receive more parental care. What we see in the Kayentatherium babies is that their faces are very similar to the faces of the adults, so when they grow up they basically just scale up the same shape, Hoffman says. This type of development is similar to the way baby reptiles grow after hatching, but distinct from mammalian growth in which babies often have short, big eyed, cute faces that significantly change as they grow. Furthermore, the hands and wrists of the baby Kayentatherium were already structurally strong. When they hatched out of their eggsjust like the modern platypus or echidnathe Kayentatherium babies were ready to get moving. The research provides clues to how our Jurassic ancestors went from a more reptile like mode of reproduction to something resembling the propogation of modern mammals, but to find the transition point, additional analysis and discovery are needed. While some experts place animals like Kayentatherium close to the evolutionary lineage that spawned mammals, others see them as more distant protomammal cousins, Sidor says. Likewise, even closely related reptiles can have different modes of reproduction, so what may have been true for Kayentatherium may not have been true for other species. Still, Sidor says, this is a really important and spectacular discovery, particularly because the find fills in details of the life and behavior of Kayentatherium that experts never expected to find. This is a find that shows the importance of the fossil record, Hoffman says. Without physical evidence of association between an adult and juveniles, the way animals like Kayentatherium reproduced would have remained obscured by a 185 million year gap in time. The most spectacular finds are not always as obvious as a giant dinosaur skeleton embedded in the bedrock, and this family of Kayentatherium serves as a reminder to keep an eye out for stuff youre not necessarily looking for, Hoffman says, as there are surely more surprises waiting in the rock."}, {"title": "This Dino-Era Bird Was as Advanced as Modern Species. So Why Did It Disappear?", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "November 14, 2018", "doc": "During the age of the dinosaurs, there were lots of species of birds that came from many different lineages. But about 65 million years ago, when the fifth great extinction took place, all of those birdsexcept for a few flightless specieswent extinct along with the dinosaurs and half the living creatures on Earth. For decades, paleontologists have wondered why so many groups of early birds went extinct. Now, reports John Pickerell at National Geographic, a new fossil from the American West deepens the mystery. The new fossil is actually an old find. Discovered 25 years ago in the Kaiparowits Formation in the recently downsized Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, the bird remains sat on a shelf at the University of California Museum of Paleontology until Jessie Atterholt, then a graduate student and now an assistant professor at the Western University of Health Sciences in Pomona, California, took a look at it. Atterholt found that the fossil came from an enantiornithine, an early lineage of birds that flitted around during the dinosaur age. While researchers have lots of bits and pieces from the fossil animals, this one was the most complete fossil found so far with about 30 percent of the skeleton intact, including almost every part of the body except the skull. The specimen is also larger than most of its relatives, about the size of a turkey vulture while others are closer to crow size or smaller. This particular species, dubbed Mirarce eatoni, is about 75 million years old, meaning it dates from the end of the Cretaceous period. It is described in a new paper published in the journal PeerJ. The completeness of the fossil allowed researchers to figure out how the birds flew and shows that by the end of the Cretaceous some enantiornithines had developed many features that made them good flyers with traits similar to those that modern birds developed after the mass extinction. We know that birds in the early Cretaceous, about 115 to 130 million years ago, were capable of flight but probably not as well adapted for it as modern birds, Atterholt says in a press release. What this new fossil shows is that enantiornithines, though totally separate from modern birds, evolved some of the same adaptations for highly refined, advanced flight styles. In particular, Mirarce eatoni has a deeply keeled breastbone, unlike earlier enantiornithines, meaning it had strong flight muscles similar to modern birds. Also, the flexible furcula, or wishbone, is V shaped versus the U shape found in earlier species, which would have given the bird extra power when flapping its wings. The fossil also shows evidence of quill knobs an adaptation on the forearm where ligaments would have attached to flight feathers, making the birds able to fly longer distances. Its believed the birds also had long tails used in mating displays. It is quite likely that, if you saw one in real life and just glanced at it, you wouldnt be able to distinguish it from a modern bird, Atterholt says in the statement. Enantiornithines fossils have been found on every continent and are more common than the group of birds that led to our modern feathered friends. The big question is, if enantiornithines were so advanced and so widespread, why didnt they survive the extinction event? And why did the ancestors of modern birds, which were flightless, make it? Paleontologist Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh, not involved in the study, tells Ryan F. Mandelbaum at Gizmodo that we can only speculate Maybe they had beaks and could eat seedsa nutritious food source that can survive in the soil for decades or centuries, a food bank for when the world went to hell when the asteroid hit. Or maybe these birds nested on the ground, so they werent wiped out with the tree living birds when forests collapsed after the asteroid hit. Or maybe they could fly longer, or grow faster, or hide easier. We dont really know. But this new discovery tells us that the birds that lived with the last dinosaurs were even more diverse than we used to think, so its more of a mystery why so few of them survived the asteroid. Researchers do have a working theory as to why enantiornithines didnt make it. The group has strongly recurved claws which are used for perching in trees and climbing, meaning their primary habitat may have been forests. Its possible that an asteroid, comet, volcanic eruptions or runaway greenhouse effect wiped out the worlds forests, taking the enantiornithines with them, a possibility that Atterholt says researchers need to look into."}, {"title": "The Mystery of Ancient Dolphins\u2019 Super-Long Snouts", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "November 8, 2018", "doc": "For a period of several million years, ancient species of dolphins glided through the seas, looking in many ways similar to todays toothed whaleswith the notable exception of their remarkably long snouts. These odd cetaceans boasted proportionally longer snouts than any other aquatic mammal or reptile, living or extinct some of their nose like appendages extended more than 500 percent further than their braincases. Even Matthew McCurry, curator of palaeontology at the Australian Museum who has studied the evolution of long snouts in extant species, finds their skulls extremely strange looking. In 2015, as a pre doctoral fellow at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, McCurry decided to take a closer look at these extinct marine mammals. Scientists have known about them for more than 100 years, but no one had pinned down the function of their bountiful snouts. The hypotheses were largely qualitative and offhand, says Nicholas Pyenson, curator of fossil marine mammals at the Museum of Natural History. People said, Oh, the long snout is probably used for stirring up prey in the sediment  What I would say is that those are adaptational hypotheses, but nothing had really been tested. So McCurry and Pyenson set out to do just that. And in a new paper published in Paleobiology, the researchers have put forth a solution to the curious case of the long snouted dolphin the creatures, they found, were able to swish their snouts through the water, using them to hit and stun prey, much as swordfish do today. In their quest to analyze the unique skulls of long gone cetaceans, McCurry and Pyenson turned to the Smithsonians vast trove of whale fossils. We have so many that have not been looked at that I actually cannot tell you the full extent of the whale fossil records that we possess, Pyenson says, but estimates that there may be as many as 15,000 in the collection. The researchers performed computed tomography CT scans of the crania of three extinct species Pomatodelphis inaequalis, Xiphiacetus bossi and Zarhachis flagellator, and casts of two other ancient cetaceans Parapontoporia sternbergi and Zarhinocetus errabundus. To compare these creatures to animals that are alive today, McCurry and Pyenson scanned two species of river dolphins, which have considerably longer snouts than their ocean dwelling counterparts, though not nearly as long as their prehistoric predecessors. The researchers also looked at two species of long snouted fish the Atlantic blue marlin and the swordfish. McCurry and Pyenson then analyzed the digital models of the skulls using calculations that engineers rely on to assess the load bearing capabilities of beams. According to Pyenson, beam theory is useful in the study of snouts because it talks about these objects as they are built to respond to forces how rigid it is, what kind of stresses are imposed on it. And the researchers found that dolphins of yesteryear would have had no trouble sweeping their impressive snouts through the water to whack their prey. Because the snouts of the species varied in shape, they moved their handy appendages in different ways. Some swept them from side to side, others up and down, and still others could move their snouts in multiple directions. Imagine a beam like a ski, Pyenson says, as an example. A ski flexes well up and down, but not side to side. A pole, which has the same shape distributed, can flex up and down and side to side, no problem. The researchers were particularly struck by the fact that these animals were not all closely related to one another. Several species appear to have independently evolved exceptionally long snouts, which suggests that something in their environment was driving the change. But what, precisely? Long snouted dolphins emerged in the Middle Miocene, a period stretching from 11.6 to 16 million years ago, when the climate was warmer than it is today. Ocean temperatures went up and sea levels rose, creating more near shore sea floor, which is a really great habitat for fish and other prey items for dolphins, Pyenson says. But fishs escape response gets quicker in warmer waters, making them more difficult to catch. It is possible, the researchers theorize, that dolphins evolved hyper long snouts during this period to give them an extra advantage during the hunt. For millions of years, global temperatures remained steady and dolphins with supremely elongated snouts frolicked in warm waters. Maybe this is a consequence of what happens when you have that kind of environment stable for several millions of years, Pyenson theorizes. These traits get exaggerated. But with the advent of the Pliocene era, the climate became more erratic and the abundance of temperate, near shore feeding grounds fluctuated. With these changes, the long nosed dolphins vanished. And this raises interesting questions about whether the evolutionary trajectory of extinct dolphins can tell us anything about how dolphins might fare in the current era of climate change. The story of these ancient creatures highlights how an organisms environment transforms its appearance, and clearly shows what we stand to lose in terms of biodiversity when an environment changes, zoologist Karina Amaral from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, who was not involved in the study, tells Ed Yong of The Atlantic. And thats important to consider, especially, at a time when many people insist on ignoring our changing climate, Amaral says. What can the evolutionary trajectory of extinct dolphins can tell us about how dolphins might fare in the current era of climate change? McCurry notes that it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions because fluctuations in temperature today are unprecedented in their cause and speed. But he does see the study as a cautionary tale, and Pyenson adds that looking more closely at ancient whales can provide insight into the future of the Earths ocean systems. High sea level rise, acidified oceans, warmer oceansthose are all traits of past whale worlds, he says. And looking at the fossil record, looking at the biological response of those past worlds, thats going to be really important moving forward."}, {"title": "Ancient Ape Was Just the Size of a House Cat", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "November 8, 2018", "doc": "Most modern apes are pretty big. The four great apesgorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees and bonoboscan weigh in at over 100 pounds. Even the lesser apes, the gibbons, can weigh as much as 30 pounds. Comparatively, as Nicholas St. Fleur at The New York Times reports, a newly discovered fossil species of ape is teeny tiny. Weighing in at less than 8 pounds, Simiolus minutus is believed to be the smallest ape species ever found. In 2004, researchers discovered a little fossilized molar in the Tugen Hills of Kenya in a layer dating back about 12.5 million years ago during the Miocene epoch. When they compared it to other fossils, they discovered they were similar to two teeth previously recovered in the area. An examination of the fossils showed that they belonged to a tiny ape species. When the paleontologists extrapolated the size of the animal based on the teeth, they found it was likely under 8 pounds, smaller than an average house cat. The research appears in the Journal of Human Evolution. More surprising, the morphology of its molars showed that it was adapted to eating fruit and leaves in trees. But that may have spelled its doom. As the little ape species headed into the canopy, the rise of the colobine monkeys was just beginning as evidenced by other fossil teeth found in the same area. The agile monkeys were likely able to outcompete the apes when it came to accessing the most nutritious leaves. Unlike apes, monkeys have tails that help them balance while running along the tops of branches. Structurally, they are more like other four legged mammals than apes, who use their strong arms to pull themselves between branches. The little ape just may not have been able to keep up with the bands of leaf munching monkeys or folivores. One thing this shows us is that some apes were leaning toward folivory at just the time when monkeys were evolving their uniquely effective adaptations for it, co author James Rossie of Stony Brook University says in a press release. Under those circumstances, Im not surprised that this is the last you see of these small apes. Weve previously found the earliest colobine monkeys at these sites, and now we have an ape that looks like it would have been in direct competition with them for food. The monkeys, it turns out, were also more able to digest the leaves and extract energy from them, whereas the apes did not have the same plumbing. They were trying to do what colobines were doing, which was foolish because no one had that same equipment, Rossie tells St. Fleur of the Times. They brought a knife to a gunfight and then found out the knife was a plastic picnic knife. The finding might shed some light on what happened during the middle to late Miocene, which took place roughly 14 million to 5 million years ago. It was around 8 million years ago when climate change began to turn the forests that apes in Africa and southern Europe roamed into grasslands, pushing many species to extinction. From a wide variety of ape speciesranging from the newly discovered tiny ape to creatures weighing around 110 poundsand just a handful of monkey species, recent research suggests that during this time of change, monkeys were able to take over the niches left by the apes, meaning by the end of the Miocene there were lots of monkeys around but just a few apes. As St. Fleur of the Times points out, that trend toward more monkeys and fewer apes remains true today, with 130 species of Old World Monkeys inhabiting Asia and Africa and just 20 species of apes remaining. The current hypothesis is that environmental changes and heavy competition from the monkey species caused the Planet of the Apes to slowly morph into the Planet of the Monkeys. While competition for food may have spelled the demise of the smallest ape, recent research indicates the worlds largest ape species also had trouble putting dinner on the table. Gigantopithecus, which stood 10 feet tall and weighed up to 1,100 pounds, survived for several million years in forests in modern day southern China. But around 100,000 years ago, when the world cooled and many forests transformed into savannahs, the mega ape simply was not able to fill its daily caloric need and joined Simiolus in the annals of ape history."}, {"title": "Dinosaurs May Have Given Birds Their Colorful, Speckled Eggs", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "November 1, 2018", "doc": "Bird eggs come in a host of beautiful colors and patterns, including the coffee colored swirls of prinia eggs, the deep green of emu eggs, and the brilliant blue of the eggs laid by the humble robin. Scientists have long believed that this variation in eggshell appearance evolved relatively recently in modern birds, because crocodiles, our feathered friends closest living relatives, lay eggs that are completely white. But as James Gorman of the New York Times reports, a new study has found that colorful eggs may have appeared all the way back in the age of the dinosaurs. In spite of their diversity, bird eggs derive their color from just two pigments protoporphyrin, which produces a reddish brown color, and biliverdin, which creates blue and green. Last year, a team led by Yale palaeontologist Jasmina Wiemann discovered these two pigments in the fossilized eggs of an oviraptor, a small, bird like dinosaur. As part of a new study, published recently in the journal Nature, Wiemann and her colleagues expanded their research to include eggshells from 15 Cretaceous dinosaurs and extinct birds, along with the eggs of living birds like chickens, emus and terns, reports John Pickrell of Science.  The researchers relied on a non destructive technique called Raman microspectroscopy, which involved bouncing lasers off the eggshells to map their molecular composition. The team detected the pigments protoporphyrin IX and biliverdin5 in the eggs of both modern birds and eumaniraptoran dinosaurs, among them the Velociraptor, which are ancient ancestors of todays birds. Not only that, the researchers could see that some eumaniraptoran eggs were spotted and speckled. The pigments were even found at the same depths from the shells surface as the eggs of modern birds. We have, very likely, a single evolutionary origin of egg color, Wiemann tells NPRs Nell Greenfieldboyce. More specifically, Wiemann thinks egg color evolved when certain dinosaurs started building open nests, rather than burying their eggs. Colors and patterns may have helped camouflage eggs that were newly exposed to predators, or allowed parents to recognize their soon to be hatched offspring, as is believed to be the case with modern bird eggs. In fact, birds that nest in enclosed spaces, like owls and woodpeckers, tend to have white eggs. Certain dinosaur eggs analyzed in the study, like those of certain sauropods and the duck billed dinosaur Maiasaura, were not found to have any pigment, which may suggest that these species continued to bury their eggs in the ground. The new study suggests there is good reason to rethink long standing ideas about egg evolution, but the results of the research are not entirely surprising. Birds, after all, have inherited other traits from their ancient ancestors. Like feathers and wishbones, study author Mark Norell says, we now know that egg color evolved in their dinosaur predecessors long before birds appeared."}, {"title": "Ritual Cemeteries\u2014For Cows and Then Humans\u2014Plot Pastoralist Expansion Across Africa", "author": "Joshua Rapp Learn", "date": "November 1, 2018", "doc": "In the Saharan regions of Africa around the sixth millennium B.C., 2,500 to 3,000 years before the great dynasties of Egypt rose along the Nile, a new way of life spread across the northeastern reaches of the worlds second largest continent. While the Sahara Desert was still relatively wet and green, nomads began to cross into the region, possibly from the Middle East, seeking more stable and plentiful lives. The traditional subsistence method of hunting and gathering was slowing giving way to a more secure practice, keeping a backup supply of food living right next to you through animal domestication and herding. Around this time, some of the earliest ritual monuments to the dead were built by animal herdersonly these cemeteries were built for cows, not humans. Cattle already, at a very early date, have social and probably symbolic significance in these societies, says Paul Lane, the Jennifer Ward Oppenheimer Professor of the Deep History and Archaeology of Africa at Cambridge University. Its not hard to see why early herders worshiped the docile and accompanying animals, which provided a reliable source of food and saved them from the hassle of tracking more elusive and dangerous prey. But the early pastoralists still had their work cut out for them. As they moved into unfamiliar territory, they faced extreme landscapes, hostile neighbors and poorly understood climate patterns. In order to overcome these obstacles, ancient headers must have gathered from time to time to provide breeding opportunities for their animals and replenish lost livestock, not to mention renewing family ties and forging new bonds through the propagation of our own species. At the same time, periodic gatherings allowed the nomads to share advice about good pastures and warnings of danger in unfamiliar lands. If you are a lone dude with a herd, as soon as you lose your herd, you are done, says Elizabeth Sawchuk, a post doctoral archaeological researcher at Stony Brook University. According to new archaeological research led by Sawchuk, early cattle cemeteries may have provided the assembly grounds that cemented networks of herders. These social gathering points allowed the pastoralists to spread through vast stretches of northern and eastern Africa over the millennia. Along with the bones of livestock, archaeologists have discovered colorful stone beads and other artifacts at the burial sites, suggesting the cemeteries played a critical role in early pastoralist life. Were dealing with groups that have developed sophisticated social networks that they adapt and modify as they encounter new landscape challenges, Lane says. Its about the beginnings of herding, Sawchuk adds. Its really the thing that kicks off the east African pastoralist tradition. The beginning of cattle herding in Africa is contentious, but some of the first evidence for pastoralist ritual gathering dates to around 7,500 years ago at a cattle burial site in modern day Egypt called Nabta Playa. This and other burials in the region, sometimes accompanied by megalithic standing stones, reveal that herders took the time to bury their animals, a significant ritual practice, even before they started burying each other. But the good times quickly dried up for pastoralists of the Sahara. Desertification and conflicts with hunter gatherer tribes sent the herders out from Egypt, some moving west as the desert dried, while others followed the lush Nile Valley to the south. At this point, humans start to show up in the huge cemetery mounds attributed to herders. We can see that these early pastoralists around the Nile are doing similar things to the people burying cattle were doing, Sawchuk says, adding that these burials sometimes included family groupings. Recently, Sawchuk was involved in a prominent dig at a monumental, roughly 5,000 year old cemetery called Lothagam North Pillar on the shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya. The site is one of the largest such cemeteries discovered in the region to date, with an estimated 580 burials spanning a period as long as 900 years. It also contains the telltale signs of ancient herderspeople who made their way even farther south from the Nile Valley. The dig revealed human remains along with vibrant stone beads, rodent teeth necklaces and other artifacts. These grand cemeteries have long perplexed archaeologists because they contrast starkly with the burial practices of modern day African pastoralists, which are influenced by religious conversion to Christianity or Islam. The massive group burials also differ from the customs of African herders encountered by colonial Europeans, who up until the early 20th century often left their dead out in the bush due to a belief that burying them would pollute the earth. Sawchuk and a team of researchers are attempting to fit Lothagam North into the larger trend of monumental pastoralist cemeteries, spanning roughly 7,500 to 2,000 years ago, when the last pastoral burial sites, which had expanded to the Central Rift Valley by this point, mostly disappeared from the archaeological record of East Africa. The team published a study last month suggesting the grand cemeteries were among the first things that pastoralists created when they arrived in new territories. After all, one of the first places a culture on the move needs is a place to bury their dead. Lothagam North shows a high degree of multi generational planning, with bodies interred in such a way that they rarely overlapped with others. But whats particularly unique about the Lothagam North site is the lack of hierarchy between the buried dead. This egalitarian approach to death separates these cemeteries from the monumental burials of agricultural societies. Entire pyramids were built for certain pharaohs, while ancient Egyptian commoners were laid to rest in unmarked pits. Its really not about one person but about community, Sawchuk says. Lane, who was not involved in Sawchuks research, is in broad agreement with her argument that the ruins of cemeteries represent early pastoralism culture around Lake Turkana. It is difficult to follow the trajectory of these pastoralists from the Nile Valley into the Lake Turkana region, however, as the area between, South Sudan, lacks archaeological research due to current political volatility. But even so, Lothgam North and five other nearby cemeteries suggest the first herders arrived about 5,000 years ago. This is kind of a crazy time in the Turkana Basin, Sawchuk says, explaining that the desertification of the Sahara led to the giant lake shrinking over time. The changing climate likely ruined some of the deep lake fishing enjoyed by communities around Turkana, but it also opened up fresh grassland in formerly submerged areasperfect for grazing cattle. Sawchuk is currently applying for grants to excavate Jarigole, another cemetery across the lake from Lothagam North, which is only just beginning to be explored. Many of the six sites around the lake occupy vantage points, and Sawchuk hopes to determine whether they were built by the same people and whether the network of burials was planned from the beginning. Times eventually changed for the pastoralists, who in later years resorted to bush burials, leaving their dead in the wild without internment. Religious conversions meant a return to burying the dead, but never again in the same grand cemeteries where the herds of the past would gather. Sawchuk believes that the effort to build these sites became too burdensome, especially as towns grew more common and easier forms of networking appeared, such as marriage alliances, which are invisible to the archaeological record but still used today. But in another sense, the lives of modern day herders are intricately tied to their pastoralist ancestors. Traveling animal husbandmen continue to experience boom and bust cycles as they face extreme and unpredictable landscapes. And the ancient cemeteries, though abandoned, serve as a reminder of the critical support system that millions of herders in East Africa still rely on today, Sawchuk says. The persistence of pastoralism in East Africa is why you see a Maasai warrior waving at you from the Nairobi airport when you land. As todays wandering herders of Africa confront the changes and challenges of the future, they may take comfort in their ancestors steadfast ability to survive by relying on one another."}, {"title": "The Grand Canyon\u2019s Oldest Footprints Are 310 Million Years Old", "author": "Meilan Solly", "date": "October 26, 2018", "doc": "Some 310 million years ago, a reptile like creature with an unusual gait roamed the sandy expanses of the Grand Canyon, leaving a trail of 28 footprints that can still be seen today. As Michael Greshko reports for National Geographic, these unusually well preserved markers represent the national parks oldest footfallsand, if additional analysis links the early reptile to one that left a similar set of prints in Scotland roughly 299 million years ago, the tracks may even earn the distinction of being the oldest of their kind by more than 10 million years. A paleontologist hiking the Grand Canyons Bright Angel Trail with a group of students happened upon the footprints in 2016. The animals path, which hardened into sandstone soon after its creator scurried off, had previously been hidden inside of a boulder. When the rock fell and split open, the winding trail was finally exposed, enabling the hikers to spot it as they explored the Arizona canyon. The scientist reported the find to a fellow paleontologist, Stephen Rowland of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and in March of this year, Rowland and geologist Mario Caputo of San Diego State University arrived at the scene to investigate further. The pair announced their preliminary findings, soon to be followed up with a formal scientific study, at this months Society of Vertebrate Paleontologys Annual Meeting. According to Rowland and Caputos presentation abstract, the broken quartz boulder preserved the reptilian creatures footprints as both impressions and natural casts measuring an overall width of about one meter across. Oddly enough, the tracks appear to represent a diagonal gait, as individual footfalls are angled 40 degrees out from the main pathway. Even if it was an ordinary trackway, it would be unusual, Rowland tells Greshko. But in this case, its doing a funny little side walking step, line dance kind of thing, which is weird. There are a number of potential explanations for the ancient animals strange gait. Perhaps a strong wind was blowing from the west, pushing the animal right as it attempted to push forward. Or maybe the creature purposefully angled its walk, hoping to steady itself on the slippery surface of a sand dune. Its unclear what species the animal belonged to, but the scientists write that they tentatively assign the tracks to a basal tetrapod of unknown taxonomic affinity and the ichnogenus category of trace fossil Chelichnus, which is all basically a very science y way to say we dont quite know what this is, but we know it had four legs. As researchers Patrick J. McKeever and Harmut Haubold explained in a 1996 article for the Journal of Paleontology, the Chelichnus classification was first used to describe a set of tracks found in Scotlands Permian of Dumfries and Galloway during the early 19th century. Unfortunately, McKeever and Haubold note, Trackways that represent variations by the same trackmaker due to gait or substrate have been assigned different names. This practice has led to widespread confusion in the area of Permian vertebrate ichnology. Still, if Rowland and Caputos new identification proves accurate, the Grand Canyon footprints may well be the oldest left by members of the mysterious group. With a skeleton with bones and teeth, you get lots of good information, but you dont actually see behavior, Rowland says to Greshko. Luckily, he concludes, weve captured this animal walking."}, {"title": "This Little Fish Was Nomming on Flesh 150 Million Years Ago", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "October 19, 2018", "doc": "The Jurassic ocean was a pretty scary place. Toothy marine lizards like ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs and plesiosaurs patrolled the worlds seas along with early sharks. New research adds another hungry creature to the mix. Hannah Osborne at Newsweek reports paleontologists in Germany have unearthed the fossils of a 150 million year old piranha like fish along with with some of its victims. According to the study published in the journal Current Biology, researchers discovered the fossilized fish, called Piranhamesodon pinnatomus in the limestone deposits of southern Germany. They used CT scans and microscopic examination to get a good look at the interior of the fossils mouth and examine its bone structure. While the fisharound 3 inches longis tiny, its teeth are not. Knife like, triangular serrated choppers jut out of its top and bottom jaws. Based on the morphology, the researchers estimate it had more than enough power to rip flesh from other fish. The finding is surprising since the fish comes from a group that is not know for eating one another. Typically, other related species specialized in cracking open organisms with hard shells. We were stunned that this fish had piranha like teeth, lead author Martina K\u00f6lbl Ebert of Jura Museum Eichst\u00e4tt says in a press release. It comes from a group of fishes the pycnodontids that are famous for their crushing teeth. It is like finding a sheep with a snarl like a wolf. But what was even more remarkable is that it was from the Jurassic period. Fish as we know them, bony fishes, just did not bite flesh of other fishes at that time. While sharks have been able to bite out chunks of flesh throughout history, bony fishes have either fed on invertebrates or largely swallowed their prey whole. Biting chunks of flesh or fins was something that came much later. P. pinnatomus, however, probably wasnt a killer. The researchers believe that the fish attacked the fins of other fish, similar to modern day piranhas. Fish fins regrow, meaning that by targeting flippers instead of killing its prey P. pinnatomus practiced sustainable carnivorism. Theres evidence for this technique. Fossils of other fish found nearby show bite marks and missing chunks of fin. The fish also probably swam around its prey undetected. Judging from the body shape and fin morphology, our fish was slow swimming but highly maneuverable, K\u00f6lbl Ebert tells George Dvorsky at Gizmodo. It lived in the sponge and coral reefs, where it would have looked quite inconspicuous, resembling any other contemporary coral fish. Since all other fish of this group ate hard shelled organisms such as shells or sea urchins, it would have been able to lurk among this crowd and thus attack its unwary prey quite effectively. Despite its taste for fish fins, P. pinnatomus is not related to modern day piranhas. Instead, its penchant for flesh is an example of convergent evolution, in which different species develop the same trait at different times and through different pathways. While the ancient fish was a salt water creature, modern piranhas are freshwater fish. The ancestors of modern piranhas didnt evolve until about 25 million years agolong after dinosaurs went extinctand todays piranha species, including a few vegetarian fish, have been around only about 1.8 million years."}, {"title": "A Case of Mistaken Sea Monster Identity", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "October 18, 2018", "doc": "In what seems to be a bit of an ugly duckling scenario in which a juvenile looks nothing like its iconic adult counterparts, researchers have discovered that fossil fragments of a prehistoric sea monster found 30 years ago in Kansas were originally misidentified.  The remnants actually belonged to a newborn baby Tylosaurus, which belonged to a family of toothy, flippered marine reptiles called mosasaurs that lived in the worlds oceans during the late Cretaceous period, or 66 to 100 million years ago, reports Laura Geggel at LiveScience. These sea beasts were known for their long, pronounced snouts and could grow up to 42 feet in length. Because the young Tylosaurus never got the chance to reach its gargantuan stature or develop its tell tale elongated jawline, paleontologists mistook it for its smaller bodied, less toothy mosasaur cousin, the Platecarpus, reports Helen Briggs at the BBC. The degree of snout development was nowhere near that of an adult, study author Takuya Konishi, a biologist at the University of Cincinnati, said to Briggs. It was the ugly duckling that hadnt yet become the graceful swan. Even though this Tylosaurus specimen was a baby, it was still about the size of Andre the Giant. The fossil fragments were originally found in 1991 in western Kansas in a fossil rich geologic formation called the Smoky Hill Chalk Member, which exists where the Western Interior Seawaya prehistoric inland sea that divided the North American continentonce was. At the time, paleontologists thought the tiny pieces were the remains of a short snouted Platecarpus, which could only grow up to 20 feet long. The fossil was at first misidentified because the fragmentsincluding part of a snout, teeth, jaw and skulldont really look like a Tylosaurus. Starkly lacking was the long, toothy snout that defines the animal. Konishi first examined the fragments back in 2004 while working on his masters degree. He was inspired to take a second look by recent advances in how mosasaurs, which all look very similar, are identified. He then realized that the fossil was from a 7 foot baby Tylosaurus, which likely died soon after birth, according to the new study published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Having looked at the specimen in 2004 for the first time myself, it too took me nearly 10 years to think out of that box and realize what it really wasa baby Tylosaurus yet to develop such a snout, he says in a statement. For those 10 years or so, I had believed too that this was a neonate of Platecarpus, a medium sized 5 6 meters 16 20 feet and short snouted mosasaur, not Tylosaurus, a giant up to 13 meters 42 feet mosasaur with a significantly protruding snout. Konishi and his team were able to identify the baby Tylosaurus using the shape of the animals braincase, the spacing of its teeth and a question mark shaped bone in the back of its jaw called a quadrate. The finding means the toothy swimmers must have developed their iconic snouts quickly between birth and their juvenile stage, since other juvenile Tylosaurus fossils do sport big noses. It also raises the possibility that early Tylosaurus species did not have the toothy snout after all. As individual development and evolutionary history are generally linked, the new revelation hints at the possibility that Tylosaurus adults from much older rock units may have been similarly short snouted, something we can test with future discoveries, Konishi says in the statement. While Tylosaurus was huge, and the mosasaur in Jurassic World was depicted at twice its actual size, it was no match compared to the largest sea monster to swim the seas. Earlier this year paleontologists revealed that ichthyosaur fossils found on an English beach could have come from a creature up to 85 feet long, though that is still dwarfed by the modern blue whale, which can reach 100 feet in length."}, {"title": "Tiny Skull Illuminates the Lives of Giant Dinosaurs", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "October 11, 2018", "doc": "As far as dinosaurs go, Diplodocus was certainly one of the largest. Full grown adults could stretch more than 80 feet in length and weigh more than 13 tons. But, like all dinosaurs, these titans started off small. They hatched from eggs you could easily hold in your hand, starting their lives in a biological race to get big quick or perish at the teeth of ravenous carnivores. A rare skull from one of these young dinosaurs is helping paleontologists better understand the perilous life of Diplodocus as they started on their journey toward becoming giants.  University of Toronto paleontologist Cary Woodruff calls the fossil Andrew. The skull and first vertebra of the little giant were found among the roughly 150 million year old strata in a particular spot called the Mothers Day Quarry where multiple young Diplodocus were entombed. The skull is special for two reasons. While over one hundred Diplodocus specimens are known, Woodruff says, fewer than a dozen skulls exist, and of those, only a few are from immature animals. Andrew adds to that list, and, on top of that, is the smallest Diplodocus skull yet known. The fossil is described today in Scientific Reports.  In life, Woodruff and colleagues estimate, Andrew would have been about 20 to 30 feet long. Much of that length would have been neck and tail. For Andrew, Woodruff says, imagine you took the body of a small cow and stuck a python on it. Thats still awfully large for a young animal. The juvenile Diplodocus found at the Mothers Day Quarry were between two and six years old at the age of death, Woodruff says, meaning these dinosaurs grew fast once they hatched from their eggs.  Andrew wasnt just a pint sized version of an adult Diplodocus, though. In addition to being much cuterthe large eyes and short snout adding to that puppy dog lookthe muzzle and teeth of this dinosaur may indicate that it was living very differently than the grown up sauropods.   Another young Diplodocus skull described in 2010 showed that the snouts of the youngsters were more narrow and rounded than those of adults, as well as having a longer row of teeth along the jaw. Andrews skull represents an even younger animal, and seems to take these trends further. Not only is Andrews snout narrower, but the teeth at the back of the jaw are different than expected. Up until now, it seemed that Diplodocus only had peg like teeth, but Andrews rear teeth have a broader, spatulate shape associated with plucking coarse vegetation like conifers.  The reason these traits matter is that they could be related to the way these dinosaurs fed. Snout shape has been shown to be a useful proxy for feeding behavior in living mammals, and this relationship has certainly been applied to an array of dinosaur species, Macalester College paleontologist Kristi Curry Rogers says.  The basic idea is that grazers, which gobble down large amounts of low quality plant food like grass, have broad, square muzzles, while browsers nip and pluck more nutritious, leafy foods with narrower or more rounded muzzles. The previously discovered juvenile Diplodocus skull was used to support this argument for dinosaurs, and, Woodruff and colleagues propose, so does Andrew.  Not that the new reconstruction is without caveats, however. Some of the skull bones missing from Andrew could significantly change the shape of the skull reconstruction. One problem here is that the material isnt well preserved enough to be sure of the interpretations, Curry Rogers says. A better preserved skull would help dispel some of the areas of uncertainty.  If the skull reconstruction of Andrew is on the mark, however, Woodruff and colleagues propose that the dietary difference could say something about the early lives of these dinosaurs. Over the past forty years, various examples of dinosaur parental care have been uncoveredparent dinosaurs sitting on nests, young that would have had to be fed, and other lines of evidence suggest that some dinosaurs looked after their offspring.  But the evidence is different among dinosaurs like Diplodocus. These dinosaurs, it seems, laid large clutches off eggs and generally left their offspring to fend for themselves, much like sea turtles today.  Andrews teeth support the idea that young Diplodocus were on their own from the beginning. If an adult Diplodocus was bringing plants to their young, why would the young have this combination of tooth type? Woodruff asks. Would the adults be bringing them these different plant types, and if so, why, since theyre not going to be eating all those plant types for the rest of their lives?  The teams hypothesis is that Andrew and the other juvenile Diplodocus in the Mothers Day Quarry were making their way through the world without parental investment, but to really test this idea, more evidence is needed. I dont see a clear line of reasoning between differential feeding strategies or precocity, Curry Rogers says, citing information from bone microstructure and postcranial anatomy to understand how diet and growth are connected for these dinosaurs.  These discussions are all part of a larger paleontological investigation of some of the largest animals to walk the Earth, and Andrew will no doubt play a continuing role. Aside from diet and behavior, in some ways Andrews skull more closely resembles those of more ancient sauropods than adult Diplodocus. Andrew could help us to understand the evolutionary history of Diplodocus, Woodruff says, further opening windows into the deep past.  This little dinosaur may have a large impact on how we understand the Jurassic world."}, {"title": "Newly Discovered Tyrant Dinosaur Stalked Ancient New Mexico", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "October 9, 2018", "doc": "Tyrannosaurs often bear fierce names. Aside from the tyrant lizard Tyrannosaurus itself, theres the monstrous murderer Teratophoneus, the frightful lizard Daspletosaurus, and the gore king Lythronax. But a new set of tyrannosaur bones extracted from the 80 million year old rock of New Mexico may have one of the most imposing names of allDynamoterror dynastes, the powerful terror ruler. The remains of Dynamoterror were found in New Mexicos Menefee Formation in 2012 during an expedition led by Western Science Center paleontologist Andrew McDonald and CEO of the Zuni Dinosaur Institute for Geosciences, Douglas Wolfe. During that years field season, expedition volunteer Eric Gutierrez found fragmented bones spilling out of the sandstone. Dinosaurs are hard to find in this part of the San Juan Basin, making almost any find worth noting, but initial clues indicated that this find was something special.  We could tell that it was a large theropod from the large fragments of hollow limb bones, McDonald says, referring to the broader family that tyrannosaurs, ostrich mimic dinosaurs, raptors, birds and others belong to. Time had not been kind to the bones of Dynamoterror, breaking and scattering the bones. It took years of puzzling together the recovered shards before the critical fragmentsa pair of telltale skull bones called frontalswere pieced together, revealing the fossils identity as a previously unknown tyrannosaur. The dinosaur is described in a paper published today in PeerJ. Although the fossil is scrappy, it still adds context to the broader picture of the roughly 25 distinct tyrannosaurs known so far. Not only is Dynamoterror new, but it falls in a specific tyrannosaur subgroup that contains some of the last and largest of the species, like T. rex itself. T. rex lived between 68 and 66 million years ago, and many of its famous relativeslike Gorgosaurus and Albertosauruslived about 75 million years ago. Dynamoterror and its relative Lythronax from Utah are more ancient still, about 80 million years old. This indicates that derived tyrannosaurs must have arisen at an even earlier date than previously expected, New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science paleontologist Thomas Williamson says. The find points to an older, as yet unknown diversification of these famous carnivores. In life, McDonald and colleagues hypothesize, Dynamoterror would have been about 30 feet long. Far larger than the earliest tyrannosaurs, though not quite as big as the celebrity T. rex, Dynamoterror is comparable in size to a few other tyrannosaurs of similar agelarge enough to earn top predator status in its ancient realm. Back in this tyrannosaurs heyday, McDonald says, the Menefee would have been much like the swamps and forest of the southeastern U.S.hot, humid, and lush. Shovel beaked hadrosaurs, armored dinosaurs, and horned dinosaurs were some of the neighbors Dynamoterror rubbed shoulders with and likely preyed upon. What makes Dynamoterror stand out, however, is that its another piece in an emerging picture of dinosaur evolution running riot between 80 and 75 million years ago. Back in the Late Cretaceous, North America was split in two by the Western Interior Seaway, a warm stretch of water that washed over the middle of the continent, with the western half known to experts as Laramidia. From the stony records of this subcontinent, paleontologists have been finding a slew of unexpected dinosaurs. Historic finds in the northern parts of Laramidia, such as modernday Alberta and Montana, revealed rich communities of dinosaurs such as tyrannosaurs, horned dinosaurs, armored dinosaurs and more. Fossils found in southern rocks of the same age were often given the same names as the northern species. But in the past three decades, paleontologists have started to put together a very different picture. New discoveries and fossil revisions have shown that the dinosaurs found in Utah, New Mexico, Texas and Mexico were not the same as those found in the north. If you were to walk from Mexico to Alaska 80 million years ago, youd find a gradient of different dinosaurs as you hiked along. Dynamoterror is part of this story, and an important one as its from an area with few known fossils. No dinosaurs had been named from the Menefee Formation until earlier this year, when an armored dinosaur called Invictarx was identified. Dynamoterror is now the second, and the fact that it differs from other known tyrannosaurs of a similar age indicates that there were distinct evolutionary pockets along the length of the ancient subcontinent. The new tyrannosaur also points to what may yet be found. Both Dynamoterror and Lythronax are from southern North America and are about 80 million years old. There seems to be a bias against the preservation of dinosaurs in rocks of this age, Williamson says, but the few and often scrappy fossils that have turned up have indicated that dinosaur diversity was just as rich as it was in the 75 million year old rocks where preservation is better.The search is taxing, but it means there are more dinosaurs to dig up.  Some of them will likely be tyrannosaurs. To the north, McDonald says, roughly contemporaneous rocks have yet to produce diagnostic tyrannosaurid material. It could very well be that there were other unusual tyrant lizards in northern Laramidia, now entombed in the rocks, waiting to be uncovered and help fill in the picture of how these tyrants came to rule North America. Editors Note, October 9, 2018 A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Douglas Wolfe was the 2012 expedition volunteer who found the Dynamoterror bones, when, in fact Douglas Wolfe co led the 2012 expedition, and volunteer Eric Gutierrez found the fossil. The story has been edited to correct that fact."}, {"title": "Ancient Teeth With Neanderthal Features Reveal New Chapters of Human Evolution", "author": "Brian Handwerk", "date": "October 3, 2018", "doc": "Crime drama fans know that forensic scientists can ID the remains of long missing persons by examining their teeth. To solve even more ancient mysteries, anthropologists use the same kind of cutting edge tooth technology, and a European team may have cracked a very cold case indeedone thats almost half a million years in the making. A fossil tooth study published today in the journal PLOS ONE analyzes some of the oldest human remains ever found on the Italian Peninsula. The teeth, which are some 450,000 years old, have some telltale features of the Neanderthal lineage of ancient humans. Dating back to the Middle Pleistocene, the fossils help to fill in gaps in an intriguingly complex part of the hominid family tree. The species Homo neanderthalensis shares an unknown common ancestor with our own species, Homo sapiens, but its unclear exactly when the lineages diverged. Homo sapiens evolved perhaps 300,000 years ago, according to the fossil record, while Neanderthals evolutionary timeline has proven even trickier to pin down. Some genetic studies suggest that their lineage split from our own as long as 650,000 years ago, but the oldest definitive fossil evidence for Neanderthals extends back only about 400,000 years. To help to take a bite out of that gap, Cl\u00e9ment Zanolli of the Universit\u00e9 Toulouse III and colleagues used detailed morphological analyses and micro CT scanning techniques to painstakingly measure the 450,000 year old teeth. The teeth were then compared, inside and out, to those of other ancient human species, revealing that they have Neanderthal like features. With this work and other recent studies, it seems now evident that the Neanderthal lineage dates back to at least 450,000 years ago and maybe more, Zanolli says in an email. This age is much older than the typical Neanderthals, and before our study it was unclear to which human fossil species these Italian remains were related. Most Neanderthal fossils are far more recent, dating from about 130,000 to 40,000 years ago, making evidence of the species earlier period hard to come by. The Middle Pleistocene Era teeth were found at two different sites, one near Rome Fontana Ranuccio and another outside Trieste Visogliano. Together, these tiny fossils represent an intriguing piece of physical evidence that supports the findings of genetic studies of ancient human ancestry. I think that this is an interesting study, demonstrating that many of the features of Neanderthal teeth are present in Europe as far back as 450,000 years ago, which is farther back in time than Neanderthals have yet been identified in the fossil record, says Ohio State University anthropologist Debbie Guatelli Steinberg in an email, who wasnt involved in the study. This pushes back the hard evidence of the split of Neanderthals from modern humans and is entirely consistent with the divergence dates coming from ancient DNA analyses, which suggest that the divergence occurred before 450,000 years ago. But the story isnt as simple as a fork between modern human and Neanderthal lineages. Rather, the ancestral tree of the genus Homo appears wonderfully complex. There are other European fossils of comparable age that lack the Neanderthal features of these Italian fossils, and therefore indicate that other kinds of humans, besides Neanderthals, may have been present in Europe during this period of time, Guatelli Steinberg says. One species in particular, Homo heidelbergensis, has been suggested as the possible common ancestor of both Neanderthals and modern humans. During the Middle Pleistocene, another species called Homo heidelbergensis was present in Europe, and its relationships either with Neanderthals or with more archaic species like Homo erectus are still unclear, Zanolli says. As scientists further untangle the evolutionary pathways of ancient humans, teeth will likely continue to play a critical role. Made of enamel, the bodys hardest biological substance, teeth tend to survive longer than bone. Additionally, the shapes and structures of teeth provide a valuable diagnostic tool to discriminate between our various ancient hominin relatives. But how does one tell a Neanderthals tooth from a modern humans, or any of the lineages in between? Paleoanthropologist Kristin Krueger of Loyola University of Chicago says that in general, teeth and jaws get smaller as evolution progresses, likely due to dietary changes such as the development of cooking. But when it comes to teeth, size isnt the only thing that matters. Cusps, crenulations, ridges and other features can be used to categorize the teeth of early humans. Tooth interiors can differ as well, and variations like enamel thickness and pulp chamber size can yield critical information to the trained eye. This study is an excellent example of what we can learn about evolution from teeth in general, and also what we can learn without destructive analysis, Krueger says in an email. The dental record from this time period and location is rare, so to have the number of teeth and analyze them to this degree without having to cross section them or do destructive analysis which is necessary for DNA analysis is of paramount importance. And teeth can potentially do much more than simply uncover the roots of our evolutionary family tree. Ancient chompers can often teach us about the lives and diets of the ancient humans they belonged to. We think of teeth and dental records when identifying a random body in the woods, but what we dont often appreciate is the scope of information that teeth can reveal. They are like little windows into a persons life and can tell us about things like age, diet, hygiene, migration patterns, weaning practices, stress episodes and more, Krueger says. That such information might endure for half a million years makes the humble tooth an important tool for untangling the complex threads of early human origins."}, {"title": "The World\u2019s Earliest Known Animal May Have Been a Blob-Like Undersea Creature", "author": "Meilan Solly", "date": "September 21, 2018", "doc": "Some 558 million years ago, the Dickinsoniaa mysterious blob like organism measuring roughly four feet long and bearing rib like segments across its squishy surfaceleft its imprint on the ocean floor, beginning the fossilization process that would preserve its likeness to this day. Now, Maya Wei Haas reports for National Geographic, a group of international researchers has analyzed a recently discovered Dickinsonia fossil and arrived at a surprising conclusion The ovaloid undersea creature, which belongs to the enigmatic Ediacaran biota, is not a fungus, plant or single celled protozoa, but a full fledged animal. In fact, the teams findingsnewly published in Sciencesuggest the Dickinsonia may be the worlds earliest known animal. According to Gizmodos George Dvorsky, researchers led by Australian National Universitys Ilya Bobrovskiy identified cholesterol molecules on a more than 500 million year old Dickinsonia fossil unearthed near the White Sea in northwest Russia. The scientists believe the oddball organism produced this cholesterol, which represents a type of fat, during its lifetime. And, since animals are the only organisms capable of producing cholesterol, they argue that the molecules offer definitive evidence of Dickinsonias status. Scientists have been fighting for more than 75 years over what Dickinsonia and other bizarre fossils of the Ediacaran biota were giant single celled amoeba, lichen, failed experiments of evolution or the earliest animals on Earth, study co author Jochen Brocks, a professor at the ANU Research School of Earth Sciences, said in a statement. The fossil fat now confirms Dickinsonia as the oldest known animal fossil, solving a decades old mystery that has been the Holy Grail of palaeontology. Scientific Americans Shannon Hall notes that researchers have debated the Dickinsonias origins since 1946, when Australian scientists first discovered fossilized specimens of the creature. Like other members of the Ediacaran biota, which includes forms of life found on Earth between roughly 571 to 541 million years ago, Dickinsonia exhibits few animal like characteristics, such as a mouth or visible appendage. As paleontologist Adolf Seilacher summed up in a 2007 study, the Ediacarans were as strange as life on another planet, but easier to reach. According to Science Translational Medicines Derek Lowe, the Dickinsonia was essentially a flat inflated bag with a jellyfish like consistency. Lacking a mouth, the creature was likely forced to secrete enzymes that allowed it to absorb bacterial food through its surface. BBC News Paul Rincon writes that the Ediacarans thrived until about 541 million years ago, when a surge of diversification known as the Cambrian explosion gave rise to more complex creatures that drove the simpler animals into extinction. Even as the Dickinsonia and fellow Ediacarans yielded to these new species, their legacies remained, permanently preserved in Earths fossil record. Lead author Bobrovskiy unearthed the Dickinsonia fossils at the heart of the new study back in 2016. Just imagine finding a T. rex that is so well preserved you still have the hard tissue, the skin, maybe even a mummified eye, Bobrovskiys PhD advisor Jochen Brocks, a biogeochemist at the Australian National University, tells Scientific Americans Hall. ... Thats in principle what my student found. Bobrovskiy and his colleagues extracted molecules known as sterane hydrocarbons Rincon notes that traces of these molecular structures can linger for millions of years from the fossils and found they contained cholesterol levels of up to 93 percent, as opposed to the 11 percent seen in surrounding sediment.  The problem that we had to overcome was finding Dickinsonia fossils that retained some organic matter, Bobrovskiy tells Rincon. Most rocks containing these fossils, such as those from the Ediacara Hills in Australia, have endured a lot of heat, a lot of pressure, and then they were weathered after thatthese are the rocks that palaeontologists studied for many decades, which explained why they were stuck on the question of Dickinsonias true identity. Still, some scientists remain unconvinced of the new findings. In an interview with Gizmodos Dvorsky, Jonathan B. Antcliffe, a researcher at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, described the study as completely unconvincing. He argues that the authors failed to account for potential fossil contamination and the possibility that Dickinsonia is not an animal, but another type of eukaryote. As Dvorsky explains, eukaryotes are a group of complex, multicellular organisms that encompasses animals, plants and fungi. According to BBC News Rincon, researchers have already explored these alternative options, previously classifying Dickinsonia as lichens, fungi, protozoans, evolutionary dead ends and even as an intermediate stage between plants and animals. Bobrovskiy acknowledges the potential controversy surrounding the new classification, but as he tells National Geographics Wei Haas, confirming the presence of biomarkersor stores of molecular information such as the cholesterol found on the Dickinsonia specimenremoves a large part of this uncertainty."}, {"title": "Newly Discovered Turtle Ancestors Chomped With Beaks But Bore No Shells", "author": "Katherine J. Wu", "date": "August 23, 2018", "doc": "If a turtle grows a body without a shell and no one is around to eat it, is it still a turtle? A newly discovered 228 million year old fossil says yes. Yesterday, in the journal Nature, a group of scientists reported the discovery of an ancient turtle in Southwestern China, sporting some pretty not so turtley features Not only was this foregone reptile over six feet long, but it also swam shallow waters completely barebacked.  Turtles are funny creatures. With their endearingly sluggish pace and somber mugs, theyre the toothless grandparents of the reptile family. Two of their most distinctive features are their characteristic shell and pointed, bird like snouts. But the evolution of the shell puzzled scientists for decades.  Turtles have a straightjacket of a shell, said study co author Nicholas Fraser, a paleontologist the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, in an interview with BBC. Essentially, Fraser explains, turtles shoulders are enclosed within their rib cagesnot exactly the most flexible arrangement. Its part of what explains turtles less than impressive locomotion. One would think the turtle must have a pretty dire need for this strange setup to make it worth the price of limited mobility.  If your engine tops out at just a few miles an hour, some hardy body armor might come in handyand for a long time, this seemed the most logical explanation for the evolution of the turtle shell. However, the earliest semblance of a turtle shellessentially an outgrowth of the animals rib cagewas poorly suited for defense. It covered only the turtles belly, leaving its head, neck and shoulders vulnerable to attack.  After the discovery of these half shelled turtles, some scientists began to wonder if the original shell evolved not as a fortress, but as a stabilizer. The debate still isnt settled, but it seems turtle ancestors spent much of their time burrowing through soil and sand. Over time, evolution may have shaped them into living spades stout, flat and solid. Other perks like protection came much later.  But long before turtles nestled themselves into a even this one sided breastplate, they strutted around in the buff. This new specimen, dubbed Eorhynchochelys sinensis deep breathready? Thats ay oh rink oh keel is, which translates roughly into the first beaked turtle, syn en sys, a nod to the excavation in China, was basically a gargantuan Frisbee with a long tailalready wide and waddly, but unshackled by a shell. This seems to be in keeping with previous theories of turtle evolution First, a shell less ancestor donned only front facing armor, creating an open faced reptilian sandwich. The loop eventually closed around 200 million years ago, forming the full rib based shell and locking the modern turtle into place.  Additionally, E. sinensis fills a longstanding gap that has separated turtles from other reptiles. Most other reptiles share what appears to be a crucial anatomical trait two pairs of holes in their skulls behind their eyes, where large, strong jaw muscles are anchored. Modern turtles lack these holes entirely, but the oldest turtle ancestor, dating back roughly 240 million years, still had the openings in its skull. With this work, scientists now know that 10 million years later, at least some turtles closed the gap halfway E. sinensis plugged up one opening on each side, retaining only a single pair of holes behind its eyes.  But evolution is not a direct process, and scientists still have an incomplete picture of the turtles trajectory, according to Rainer Schoch, an amphibian and reptile paleontologist at the Stuttgart State Museum of Natural History in Germany, as Jeremy Rehm reports for Nature News. E. sinensis is the earliest known turtle that bit with a beak, while others before and after it nibbled their way through life with full sets of teeth. This means the turtle beak may have blipped in and out of existence along different lineages, and scientists have yet to fully disentangle the specifics. Clearly, turtle evolution wasnt an entirely straight line, and future finds may yet change current interpretations of how even the shell was set into place.  Schoch, however, remains hopeful, that as more turtle ancestors are excavated from the fossil record, the puzzle pieces will fall into place, Rehm reports. Ultimately, what we see in modern turtles is a bit of a convergence The most useful traits, including the beak and shell, eventually came together, yielding the pleasant, plodding turtle friends we know and love today. As the saying goes, its turtles all the way downso with the weight of the world on their backs, those shells probably come in handy."}, {"title": "Rare Desert Pterosaur Fossil Discovered in Utah", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "August 14, 2018", "doc": "Researchers in Utah have unearthed one of the most detailed pterosauraka pterodactylfossils found to date, a discovery that tells us the first known vertebrates to take to the skies were more diverse and widespread than previously thought. While dinosaurs ruled the land, pterosaurs ruled the heavens during the late Triassic and Jurassic periods. Unlike the dinosaurs, whose heavy bones make pretty good fossils, we dont know much about the early evolution of the pterosaurs. Their fine bones were easily pulverized, meaning we have bits and pieces of just 30 pterosaurs dating from the Triassic, roughly 220 million years ago. The new find comes from a rock formation on public land in northeastern Utah known as the Saints and Sinners Quarry. Hundreds of millions of years ago, its believed the area was an oasis in a massive dune covered desert, drawing animals from all over the place during droughts. Some such visitors were preserved as fossils after dying at the hands of predators or getting stuck in the mud as the water dried up.  According to a press release, the area is so jam packed with thousands of Triassic bones researchers dont pluck them out of the rock one at a time. Instead, they remove large chunks of rock and bring them back to their lab at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, where they painstakingly remove the fossils from the stone. Thats what paleontologists were doing when they discovered the new pterosaur species, Caelestiventus heavenly wind hanseni. After chiseling out five crocodile fossils from one slab, they realized they had found something rare in the 200 to 210 million year old rock. They found part of the little pterosaurs face, the complete roof of the skull, the complete lower jaw and part of a wing, which they detail in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution. This one site weve pulled out 18,000 bones from an area the size of a good sized living room, BYUs Brooks Britt, the studys lead author, tells Mary Halton at the BBC. And theres only one pterosaur. The amount of material is unprecedented. In most cases, researchers only find tiny or fragmentary fossils of pterosaurs, like a finger bone or vertebrae. But the new specimen likely died in soft sand or sediment that hardened into rock, keeping the specimen intact. Most pterosaur fossils are heavily distorted literally like roadkill, Britt tells Halton. The bones are so delicate, you cant take them all the way out of the rock because they would just fall apart. The researchers didnt completely dig out the pterosaur bits, instead leaving them encased in sandstone, getting 3 D images of the bones with a CAT scan, which they used to make models of the fossils. The scans reveal some interesting info about the flying beast. The BBC reports that the fossil comes from a juvenile with a wingspan about five feet wide, likely the largest pterosaur of the era in later times, pterosaurs would evolve to reach the size of small airplanes. The animal had 112 teeth and the size and shape of its brain indicates it could see well though its sense of smell was poor. Gemma Tarlach at Discover also reports that a bony crest on its lower jaw suggests that the animal also had a pouch similar to a pelicans, used either to make vocalizations or to carry prey. Its believed the animal probably hung around the watering hole, snapping up any smaller critters stopping by to quench their thirst. But its the habitat the animal lived in thats most exciting for paleontologists. Marlowe Hood at Agence France Press reports the other pterosaur specimens dating back to the Triassic all come from what used to be coastal areas in Greenland and Europe. The fact that the new specimen was found in what used to be a vast desert suggests that the pterosaurs were evolving earlier than previously thought and moved into specialized ecological niches. The next oldest desert pterosaur doesnt appear in the fossil record for 65 million years. According to the press release, the fossil also seems to be related to another species found in Britain called Dimorphodon macronyx. Those fragmentary bones are from the Jurassic period, meaning Caelestiventus hansenis line was able to weather the Triassic Jurassic mass extinction event when huge numbers of species went extinct. It turns out the pelican like pterosaur was a rare genetic survivor, just likes its delicate bones."}, {"title": "Mysterious, Plant-Like Fossil May Have Been One of the Earliest Animals", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "August 13, 2018", "doc": "Hundreds of millions of years ago, before animals began to emerge en masse during the Cambrian period, the Earths seas were filled with mysterious, soft bodied organisms known as Ediacara biota. The first Ediacaran fossils were discovered in 1946, and ever since then, paleontologists have been grappling with how to classify these strange creatures. Some experts think Ediacarans were algae, others believe they were fungi, and still others have posited that they were a distinct kingdom of life unrelated to anything living today. Ediacarans have been described as a failed experiment in evolution, since they were believed to have died out before the emergence of animals. But as Colin Barras reports for Science, new research suggests that Ediacarans may have actually been the first animals to appear on Earth. Ediacara biota is a collective name for a large group of around 200 types of fossils that have been found across the globe. Ediacaran fossils are diverse in appearance some resemble simple blobs, some look more like worms, and some have an unusual, plant like appearancewith branched fronds that take the form of fractals and subunits replicating the pattern of the entire frond itselfbut have in fact been categorized as animalia. These creatures are believed to have died out just before the Cambrian explosion around 541 million years ago, when most major animal groups began to appear. But a new study published in the journal Palaeontology offers evidence to suggest that Ediacarans may have survived into the Cambrian period. Jennifer Hoyal Cuthill of the Tokyo Institute of Technology and the University of Cambridge and Jian Han of Northwest University in Xian, China, noticed similarities between the plant like Ediacarans and a type of marine creature called Stromatoveris psygmoglena. Found only in Chinas Chengjiang county, Stromatoveris psygmoglena is a Cambrian era animal. After examining 200 Stromatoverisi fossils, Hoyal Cuthill and Han concluded that the creature has a very similar anatomy to seven members of the Ediacara biota. Like these Ediacarans, Stromatoverisi have multiple, branched fronds which radiate outwards like seaweed, Hoyal Cuthill writes in the Conversation. The researchers also used a computer analysis to determine the evolutionary relationship between Ediacarans and a number of other groups, including Stromatoveris psygmoglena. They found that Ediacarans and Stromatoverisi belonged to their own branch on the evolutionary tree of life, which has been named Petalonamae. The analysis also revealed that Petalonamae are distinct from any other living animal group. But, according to Hoyal Cuthill and Han, both Ediacarans and Stromatoverisi were indeed animals. We found that Stromatoveris psygmoglena provides a crucial link between the older period and the animals which appeared in startling number and diversity during the Cambrian period, Hoyal Cuthill writes. The new study has been met with some doubts for instance, Simon Darroch, a geobiologist at Vanderbilt University, tells Barras that he is not entirely convinced Ediacarans and Stromatoverisi have the same fractal architecture. But Hoyal Cuthill and Hans findings could have major implications for our understanding of evolutionary history. If Ediacarans can be correctly classified as animals, that means animals began to diversify some 30 million years before the Cambrian explosion the earliest frond like Ediacarans appear in the fossil record 571 million years ago. This could mean that the petalonamids adapted more successfully to the changes of the Cambrian period than had been thought, Hoyal Cuthill writes in the Conversation, or that the Ediacaran period and its animals were less alien and more advanced than previously realized."}, {"title": "Megalodon Wasn\u2019t the Only Impressive Shark in the Prehistoric Seas", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "August 9, 2018", "doc": "If ever there were a creature that sparks our primal fear of what resides in the deep, its the megatooth shark. Known to experts as Otodus megalodon, this 50 foot long distant cousin of the modern great white was the largest predatory fish of all time. The exceptionally large specimens had mouths brimming with finely serrated teeth the size of your hand. Everything from a nod in Peter Benchleys novel JAWS to the big budget film The Meg has kept our fear of this shark alive, despite the fact that its been dead for over 2.6 million years. All this sensationalism has masked some of what weve come to know about this impressive, whale munching shark. For example, where megalodon came from in the first place. But in order to understand the origins of megalodon, we need to look back to the beginning of sharks. Putting a finger on the moment sharks became sharks is a little tricky. Its relatively simple to look at modern fish and separate sharks from other fish, but, the further back in time you go, the fuzzier the dividing lines become. Still, DePaul University paleontologist Kenshu Shimada says, sharks as cartilaginous fishes in a broad sense go back roughly 400 million years ago. Many of these earliest sharks are only known from scales or teeth. One of the earliest sharks, called Leonodus, is principally known from two pronged teeth. Comparisons with later, better known sharks, hints that Leonodus was more eel like in form than most sharks were familiar with today. But the fossil record is not always so spare. A skeleton found in New Brunswick, Canada helps reveal what these early sharks were like. Named Doliodus problematicus Latin for problematic deceiver, this fish, one of the oldest sharks ever unearthed, had a wedge shaped head and spines jutting from its fins and underside. Some modern sharks retain fin spines, Shimada says, but the major reduction in the number of spines have made modern sharks less spiny in appearance compared to their earliest ancestors. These spines likely acted as protection from the other jawed fish that were proliferating in the same ancient seas. If only more sharks were preserved in such detail. Despite having such a long historynearly twice as long as that of dinosaursthe vast majority of sharks in the fossil record are represented by isolated teeth, Shimada says. There are some exceptionsthe 318 million year old Bear Gulch Limestone in Montana preserves some sharks in delicate detailbut most of what we know about ancient sharks comes from teeth. An entire group of early sharks called cladodonts, for example, are primarily known from strange teeth that feature a long, central blade surrounded by smaller tines. They look like terrible crowns, and were suited to trapping slippery prey rather than cutting. Even so, we can learn a great deal about the nature of these ancient swimmers from what theyve left behind. Despite their reputation as living fossils that have persisted unchanged, we know fossil sharks took on a vast array of body sizes, shapes, and ornamentations, from eel like xenacanthids decorated with unicorn like spikes to the striking Stethacanthus, which was adorned with what looks like a bristly comb atop its head. In fact, finds at places like Bear Gulch help illuminate the behavior of some of these strange forms. One particular fossil found there is of two roughly six inch sharks called Falcatus. The two seem to have died courting, with the female with her jaws around the males spike like head ornament, perhaps giving us a look at mating habits long ago.   Even familiar species are undergoing revision. A good example is the gigantic Cretaceous shark Cretoxyrhina mantelli from Kansas, Shimada says. The fact that the teeth of this shark looked like those of modern mako sharks led paleontologists to propose a connection between the fossil shark and the modern seagoing speed demons. But thats changed. A small number of skeletal remains have allowed us to better infer the species body size, body form, tooth organization, and even its growth pattern, Shimada says, revealing that Cretoxyrhina was a unique shark that wasnt just a prehistoric carbon copy of todays mako sharks. Stretching to about 23 feet in length, this Ginsu shark was a bulkier predator that was more similar in size and lifestyle than todays great white, only feeding on marine reptiles like mosasaurs and plesiosaurs instead of seals. Against that background, we can turn our gaze back to megalodon. As with most other ancient sharks, navigating the origins of megalodon is primarily a story of teeth. In the case of this celebrity shark, Swansea University paleontologist Catalina Pimiento says, there is still some debate about specifics, but I am convinced megalodon belongs to the extinct family Otodontidae, which is thought to have sprung from an even more ancient form called Cretalamna. This taxonomic wrangling is important, not just for scientific communication but because determining the closest relatives of megalodon helps inform ideas and debates about where the shark came from and how it behaved. When megalodon was thought to be a close relative of todays great white shark, for example, much of the great whites behavior was transposed onto its larger relative. Now that megalodon is further removed from the great white, finding its root among other megatooth sharks, paleontologists have to ask new questions about a shark that seemed familiar. So far as paleontologists have been able to track, sharks recognizable as megalodon evolved about 20 million years ago. That raises the question of what was happening at that time to spur the evolution of such an impressive fish. There were a lot of environmental changes going on during that time period, Pimiento says, including a pulse of global warming. This might be related to the rapid evolution of many new marine mammalsthe primary food source for megalodon   and allowed such an impressive shark to arise. And it was certainly an imposing presence in the seas right from the start. The body size of this species did not vary over time, Pimiento says, meaning megalodon was always a giant. There were other large sharks at the time   the ancestors of the great white were swimming the same seas   but none were even close to the same size as megalodon. All things considered, being large and in charge worked well for megalodon. The shark swam the seas for over 17 million years, eventually following its prey species into extinction as changes to global temperature and sea level dramatically altered ocean habitats. What we have left now are teeth and some vertebrae that allow us to appraise this massive predator from 2.6 million years distance."}, {"title": "\u2018Amazing Dragon\u2019 Fossils Unearthed in China Rewrite Story of Long-Necked Dinosaurs", "author": "Meilan Solly", "date": "July 25, 2018", "doc": "Roughly 174 million years ago, a long necked dinosaur roamed the plains of what is now northwest China. The creaturedubbed Lingwulong shenqi, or the Lingwu Amazing Dragonwas a member of the sauropod family, a group of dinosaurs that includes the famous Brontosaurus and the largest land animals to walk the earth. The Lingwu dinosaur boasted measurements of about 50 feet from head to whip like tail, enjoyed a plant based diet, andin a shocking twist for paleontologistsburst onto the scene not only 15 million years earlier than previously estimated, but in an entirely different region than anticipated. Newsweeks Aristos Georgiou reports that an international team led by the Chinese Academy of Sciences Xing Xu has unearthed fossils from eight to 10 individual dinosaurs since launching excavations in 2005. Based on these skeletal remains, the paleontologists pieced together a profile of Lingwulongnewly published in the journal Nature Communicationsand shattered long held beliefs about the sauropod familys origins. Xu tells Georgiou that researchers previously thought diplodocoids, a subgroup of a subgroup of the sauropods known as neosauropods, emerged during the aftermath of Asias split from the Pangaea supercontinent roughly 164 to 158 million years ago. The neosauropods include most of the famous sauropod dinos, such as Apatosaurus and Brachiosaurus. As BBC News Mary Halton notes, neosauropod fossils have been found in in North America, Europe and eastern Africa, but until now, none were older than 160 million years old, and none were found in Asia. The lack of neosauropods in Asia led scientists to conclude that the breakup of Pangaea created a vast sea that stopped Jurassic era animals from continent hopping. According to National Geographics Michael Greshko, the new discovery suggests that the sauropods lineage branched off 15 million years earlier than once thought. We propose that many of the groups that were supposedly absent in China might well have been present, but we simply do not see them there yet because of poor sampling in the fossil record rather than genuine absence, University College London paleontologist and study co author Paul Upchurch tells Greshko. In a UCL statement, Upchurch adds that Lingwulongs presence in Asia shows that multiple species of neosauropods spread across Pangaea prior to the supercontinents fragmentation, contradicting the idea that Asias dinosaurs evolved in isolation from the rest of the world. Now, the 174 million year old fossils serve as the earliest known examples of neosauropods, pushing the dinosaur familys emergence back from the Late Jurassic to the Middle Jurassic period. However, not all paleontologists are convinced. John Whitlock of Mount Aloysius College tells Gizmodos Jessica Boddy that he doesnt believe that Lingwulong is a diplodocoid and might be more related to Chinese sauropods called Mamenchisaurus or Omeisaurus. Researchers are still learning about the amazing dragon and its habits, but Xu tells Newsweeks Georgiou that Lingwulong likely traveled in herds and dined on lakeside plants. Philip Mannion, a study co author and paleontologist at Imperial College London, further explains to that the species was similar in appearance to other sauropods, although it had a slightly shorter neck. They probably moved around fairly slowly most of the time, in small herds, and ate quite a lot, he concludes."}, {"title": "Study Suggests Neanderthals Sparked Their Own Fire", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "July 23, 2018", "doc": "Every year, we find more evidence that our hominin cousins the Neanderthals shared commonalities with us they made jewelry, appreciated beauty, buried their dead and possessed language. In fact, they are, at least partially, usNeanderthal DNA makes up roughly 2 percent of the genome of people with European and Asian heritage. Now, Sarah Zhang at The Atlantic reports, a new study suggests they even possessed a technology that we believed only our species had masteredmaking fire on demand. Archaeologists have previously come across Neanderthal fire pits, and their ability to make fire dependent substances like tar indicates that fire was an important part of their lifestyle. However, researchers surmised that the Neanderthals had to rely on natural events like lightning strikes and forest fires to give them Prometheus gift, which they then had to painstakingly tend to preserve. But Andrew Sorensen of Leiden University wasnt so sure about that conclusion. Ancient humans could make fire on demand by smashing the naturally occurring mineral pyrite against flint, making a small shower of sparks that could be nursed into a larger fire. According to a press release, he wondered if Neanderthals might have possessed that simple technology as well. To investigate, he first collected chunks of flint off beaches in England. When struck right, flint rocks will flake, creating sharp hand axes known as bifaces, which Neanderthals and early humans used for lots of daily tasks. Sorensen created his own bifaces in the lab, and then used them and pieces of pyrite to produce fire. Then he examined the microscopic marks left on the bifaces by the pyrite, which leave a very distinctive type of mark. Sorensen and his team compared those with bifaces found at archaeological digs, searching for telltale signs that the flint had been used to start fires. A hand axe was the Neanderthal Swiss Army Knife, he says in the release. They used them for everything. But only making fire with pyrite would have produced this exact suite of use wear traces. The team found that 26 surfaces on 20 bifaces recovered from Neanderthal sites in France showed these distinctive marks, indicating that they had won the quest for fire. The research appears in the journal Scientific Reports. The finding is, to say the least, controversial. Dennis Sandgathe, expert in stone technology at Simon Fraser University, not involved in the study, tells Ben Guarino at the Washington Post that the technique of comparing experimental wear patterns to artifacts is not an exact science. Sorensen agrees, but he thinks the idea that Neanderthals sparked up their own fires makes more sense than the wildfire theory. He acknowledges, however, that its possible the scratches were created by some other task we dont know about. We always explain that its an interpretation, he says. There are other reasons to exercise a healthy sense of skepticism toward the claim. In a separate interview with Zhang of the Atlantic, Sandgathe says that he has previously looked at caves occupied 40,000 to 100,000 years ago, where his team found that fire pits were common during warm periodswhen lightning would be more likelynot in cold periods. Also, hes never found a biface and pyrite together in the same layer. Then again, he says the archaeological record, when it comes to what was going on 50,000 years ago, is woefully incomplete. Guarino reports that Sorensen hopes to follow up on the study to see if the earliest humans used the same or similar technologies to make fire. Its even possible we learned the technique itself from Neanderthals, he speculates. Which would mean Neanderthals gave us more than just a little DNA. They also gave us the eternal gift of barbecue."}, {"title": "Homecoming King: The Nation\u2019s T. rex Returns to the Smithsonian", "author": "Katherine J. Wu", "date": "July 17, 2018", "doc": "Just a couple inches closer and its all over for this Triceratops. Towering overhead, the Tyrannosaurus rex looms large and menacing, one stabilizing foot planted firmly onto the Triceratops flank, as its monstrous maw descends to tear its victims head from its frilly shoulders. Its the gut wrenching theater of macabre, enough to raise the hairs on the back of anyones neck. The good news? The pair, frozen in this frightful snapshot, will soon be on display for all the world to see. Today, the National Museum of Natural History unveiled a sneak peek of the Nations T. rex in its momentous return to Washington, D.C. after a four year hiatus. It also announced that the newly renovated David H. Koch Hall of FossilsDeep Time will open to the public on Saturday, June 8, 2019, a debut that will include the first fully assembled T. rex skeleton to be on display at the Smithsonian. The patriotically named dinosaur returns after a few years abroadbut rex hasnt squandered its time soaking up the sights. The fossils of this T. rex have spent the last four years being meticulously assembled by a team of scientists in Canada. The new Hall is named in honor of philanthropist David H. Koch, who made a generous contribution of 35 million, the largest single donation in the Museums history. The entire project is projected to cost 125 million. Our dinosaurs are coming home, says the Museums director Kirk Johnson at a preview of the hall today. And not just to any home the new hall will reopen as what Johnson describes as the most visited room in the most visited natural history museum in the world. As a whole, the Museum delights 7 million patrons from around the world each year.  For now, the T. rex is not yet assembled into its final form The skeleton only recently arrived back on American soil, bones parceled out between a dizzying number of crates that await unpacking. The display will eventually yield a formidable and fully formed beast standing at about 15 feet tall and 40 feet long, poised to glut on the body of an unlucky Triceratops. This cinematic scene will take about a month to assemblebut the exhibit has already been decades in the making. In 1988, rancher Kathy Wankel was baffled to stumble upon the pristine skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus rex while enjoying an innocent hike with her family in Montanas Fort Peck reservoir. Because they were on federal property, Wankel quickly notified the authorities. Over the next two years, the newly dubbed Wankel rex was carefully excavated by a team of paleontologists led by Jack Horner from the Museum of the Rockies in nearby Bozeman. For nearly 20 years, the 66 million year old fossils held tenure in the Montana museum, splayed in the original configuration in which the bones had been foundthe T. rexs death pose. But five years ago, the Smithsonians Museum of Natural History finalized a 50 year loan agreement with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to display the Wankel rex in the nations capital, securing what Johnson calls the first significant addition to the fossil hall since 1981. And so, in 2014, seven tons of fossils began a lumbering 2,000 mile weekend road trip from Montana to Washington, D.C., nestled in the back of a hefty FedEx 18 wheeler emblazoned with a grandiose tagline Delivering History. The Nations T. rex was reborn. Upon the T. rexs arrival at the Museum, hundreds of bones were carefully unwrapped from a veritable bevy of packing material required to withstand the turbulent trip. The fossils were first 3D scanned to generate a lasting digital rendering of the skeleton that could be studied past the lifespan of the precious, material bones.  Some fortunate patrons who visited the Museum between the months of April and October of 2014 had the chance to see the scanning process in action in an annexed Rex Room. But by fall of that year, the daunting dino mascot was again on the move this time, crossing international borders in a hard detour to the Great White North. Before rex could premiere to the public, it first needed to be fitted for its debutante dress A set of custom metal frames for each individual bone, cradling the delicate fossils while anchoring them to the scaffold of its final choreography. This task fell to Ontarios Research Casting International, an aptly named firm with a prestigious history of assembling dinosaurs for museums around the world. Its a game of Jenga with incomprehensible stakes. Gone are the days when curators drilled holes into fossils to install binding ropes and bars a fate tragically endured by many of the former Halls original specimens The goal now is to preservenot only for display purposes, but also so scientists can still access the individual specimens for future research. Thus, each of the metal ligaments that secures the fossils is removable. Complicating matters was the issue of theatrics. The Montana death pose may have been accurate, but Smithsonian curators were determined to maneuver the bones into a configuration that displayed T. rex in all its former glorysomething at the intersection of realistic and visually striking, all while being mindful of the irreplaceable fossils themselves. Fortunately, much of the finagling could be done digitally, thanks to the Museums 3D scans. But the question remained How would rex regale? It was truly the worlds most intimidating jigsaw puzzle. But then arose the idea of adding a second player a Triceratops. It was a unique scenariosomething no other museum had executed before, positioning two dinosaurs in a fight that would have happened 66 to 68 million years ago. It allowed us to do something no ones done yet with a T. rex these two animals directly engaged, explains Matthew Carrano, the Museums curator of dinosaurs. Upon closer inspection, the Triceratops underfoot may seem familiar to the most zealous of natural history buffs. Nicknamed Hatcher for his paleontologist discoverer, the Triceratops in question has been on display at the Smithsonian since 1905, albeit usually in less precarious situations. In truth, Hatcher is actually a not so secret clone, cast from a cobbling of different Triceratops skeletons in 1998 yet another replica will be the one to join the Wankel rex in Hatchers final matinee.  In addition to a partial decapitation, Hatcher will sport a broken horn and a couple fractured ribsa grisly indication of the T. rexs staggering power. But the Triceratops fate may have already been sealed Its unclear whether T. rex is poised to deliver a fatal blow, or simply capitalizing on some conveniently located roadkill. Although T. rex is recognized as the largest carnivore in western North American during its time, scientists are not sure whether the tyrant king was more of a predator or a scavenger the two certainly arent mutually exclusive. So, while its plausible that a Triceratops would have comprised a typical T. rex treat, the nature of their interactionand whether the Triceratops had already been felled by some other malady firstis left up to the imagination. The send off seems grim, but no one can say Hatcher isnt retiring in style. Once Carrano and Research Casting International were satisfied with this climactic rendering, the team then disassembled the duo and prepared them for the return trip to D.C. While the Wankel rex was on sabbatical, the Museum seized the opportunity to revamp the entirety of its century old fossil hall, hoping to reinvigorate the exhibition with the latest paleontological science in time to coincide with the return of rex. And so began the largest, most extensive renovation in museum history. When the new Koch Hall of Fossils reopens in June 2019, it will reveal a completely refurbished 31,000 square foot space stocked floor to ceiling with dazzling fossils from eras gone bycentered around the Nations T. rex as its breathtaking pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. Over 700 specimens of animals, plants and insects will accompany the T. rex in showcasing the 3.7 billion years of life thus far on Earth. The history of life has always been rich and diverse and complicated as it is today, just without humans, says Kathy Hollis, the Museums national fossil collections manager. Were just a blip or a moment in the Earths history. We have the consciousness to think about that, and put ourselves in context of history and future. Although 80 to 85 percent of this T. rex at least, by size was recovered in the excavation, several of the fossils, including the head and most of the ribs, are too fragile for display. Just over half of the bones that are ultimately unveiled to the public will be bona fide dino carefully reconstructed synthetics will fill in the gaps. For the bones for which there is no true counterpart, Carrano and his team have appended approximations with the utmost accuracy, either drawing from mirror images in the dinosaurs anatomy or modeling on other T. rex skeletons from separate excavations. The Wankel rex surfaced at an opportune juncture in the timeline of paleontological technology. With the mostly intact skeleton, scientists eagerly expanded their knowledge of Tyrannosaurus, including the first physical forearm specimen in history. Whats more, we now know the Nations T. rex died when it was about 18 years old. Delightfully, the age of a dino tracks like a tree simply saw through a bone and count its rings. Its cause of death and sex, though, remain mysterious. However, Carrano believes there is more to come. Undoubtedly there are still things were going to learn from it, he says. This is an emotional time for Carrano the re opening of the fossil hall is a culmination of his career at the Smithsonian thus far, a project he has invested in since 2002. Its still a little surreal You spend so much time thinking about it, having meetings, planning for thingstheres so many people involved, and youre focusing on every tiny detail, he reflects. And then you forget to imagine what its like when its all done. In one way or another, Ive been thinking about this for over 16 years. Its like sending a kid off to college. In the coming weeks, the Nations T. rex will be reassembled in its new home, allowing the rest of the Koch Hall of Fossils to reshape around its centerpiece. When the Hall opens next June, the Wankel rex will finally reveal itself to the public, hopefully bringing with it a resurgence of dino fever at the Smithsonian. But luckily for Hatcherand the rest of the worldboth Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus will remain frozen for the foreseeable future no ones getting eaten just yet."}, {"title": "Oldest Stone Tools Outside Africa Unearthed in China", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "July 12, 2018", "doc": "Throughout the 20th century, the widely accepted story of humanitys migration from Africa began with a human ancestor called Homo erectus, a relatively big brained, tall species of hominin that began to venture all across Asia more than a million years ago. But in recent decades, new evidence has begun to punch holes in that timeline. Now, reports Carl Zimmer at The New York Times, new stone tools unearthed in China indicate someone made it 8,000 miles from Africa to east Asia as far back as 2.12 million years ago, and that someone probably wasnt Homo erectus. Zimmer reports that back in 1964, researchers found the skull of a Homo erectus in the Lantian area of the Shaanxi province, which at the time they placed at around 1.15 million years. When researchers revisited the Lantian site in the early 2000s, however, they determined that the layer the skull came from was olderabout 1.63 million years old. They also noticed what appeared to be stone tools embedded 200 feet up in a cliff face. That observation led to 13 years of painstaking excavations. During that time, the team found that various human ancestors occupied the site in Shangchens southern Chinese Loess Plateau between 1.26 and 2.12 million years ago. According to their study, published in the journal Nature, the researchers uncovered 80 stone artifacts found in 11 layers of soil deposited when the climate was warm and wet. They also uncovered 16 artifacts in six layers that date to a time when the climate conditions were colder and drier. Most importantly, they were able to date the layers of soil using a technique called paleomagnetism by looking at certain minerals which align with the Earths magnetic field, which occasionally flip flops. The oldest artifacts were found in a layer sandwiched between rock formed 2.14 million years ago and 1.85 million years ago. Based on their position, the researchers estimate six of the tools are 2.12 million years old, making them the oldest stone tools found outside Africa. The finding doesnt necessarily indicate that it was Homo erectus which made it to China faster than previously thought. Its believed Homo erectus hadnt even evolved by this point, so the artifacts could suggest that a whole other species of hominins expanded east to Asia. The implications of all this are large, Michael Petraglia, a paleoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute not involved in the study, tells Zimmer. We must re evaluate our understanding of human prehistory in Eurasia. So if it wasnt Homo erectus, who was living in China so long ago? A trove of fossils unearthed in Dmanisi, Georgia, which was the previous oldest hominin site outside of Africa, may shed some light. It included stone tools and, more importantly, part of a skull from a relatively small brained, short hominin. Its possible that this species or one like it expanded across Eurasia first. Then again, perhaps we dont have the dates for Homo erectus nailed yet. It is entirely possible that Homo erectus occupied China at this time, but given the age of the site, and the possibility that artifacts may be found at even earlier ages, another member of the genus Homo may be occupying Asia, such as a Homo habilis like ancestor, Petraglia tells Michael Greshko at National Geographic. Rick Potts, the head of the Smithsonian Institutions Human Origins Program, agrees, telling Zimmer that he believes that some Homo erectus like fossils older than 2.1 million years old may still be found in Africa, making it plausible that a larger human like hominin made the artifacts found in Lantian. Just because this species made it out of Africa, however, doesnt mean that they are somehow the ancestor of modern humans. There were likely many species or populations of hominins that left Africa, only to die out somewhere in their journey across the globe. Some populations got all the way over to eastern Asia, but we have to imagine that these were small, sort of hunting and gathering populations, Petraglia tells Robinson Meyer at the Atlantic. And while they may have mated across East Asia, it doesnt mean they survived for a long period of time. Some populations might have become isolated, and some might have become extinct. Some might have even gone on to develop into other species, like the Indonesian Homo floresiensis dubbed the hobbits by the media who may have evolved much earlier than first thought, according to recent research. Its unlikely this will be the only discovery about early humans to come out of China. While most paleoanthropologists have spent most of their time and resources searching for hominins in Africa, an increase in fieldwork in China and the rest of Asia is sure to dig up a few more surprises about our increasingly complex human family tree."}, {"title": "The Most Massive of Dinos Evolved Earlier Than Previously Thought", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "July 9, 2018", "doc": "Dinosaurs include some of the largest, mightiest animals ever to walk the Earth. Every couple of years, it seems, were introduced to a new fossil contending for the biggest ever. So it can be easy to forget that it took many millions of years for these supersized saurians to evolve the earliest creatures we call dinosaurs were only about the size of a German shepherd. Thanks to the incomplete nature of the fossil record, scientists are still scratching their heads over exactly when and why giant dinosaurs first appeared. Now the remains of an unusually large for its time dinosaur found in Argentina provides new insight into the evolution of hugenessand suggest that the way dinos like Brontosaurus got large wasnt the only way to do it. In 2015, while exploring northwestern Argentinas Marayes El Carrizal Basin, fossil technician Diego Abel\u00edn from the Universidad Nacional de San Juan discovered the bones of a surprisingly large dinosaur. The fossil would turn out to include six neck vertebrae, part of the right shoulder blade, and most of the right forelimb. By testing them at the lab, Abel\u00edn and his colleagues would determine that the dinosaur these bones belonged to an animal that had before been seen. In Nature Ecology  Evolution, Universidad Nacional de San Juan paleontologist Cecilia Apaldetti of the Universidad Nacional de San Juan, Abel\u00edn and colleagues named the animal Ingentia prima. Within the many branches and twigs of the dinosaur family tree, Ingentia is classified as a sauropodomorphthe broad group that not only contains familiar giants like Brontosaurus, but also their cousins and ancestors going far back into the Triassic. Triassic sauropodomorphs actually looked quite a bit different from their more famous, later relatives. Some were tiny. Many were bipedal. They hadnt yet evolved the supportive, column like limbs associated with big bodies. This is what makes Ingentia so remarkable. Assuming normal sauropodomorph proportions, Apaldetti estimates that the living animal would have been between 26 and 33 feet long and weigh around 10 tons, or as much as two or three African elephants. In Triassic terms, this is enormous. Ingentia exceeds three times the size of the largest Triassic dinosaurs known to date, Apaldetti says. Despite the fact that the Triassic is often called the Dawn of the Dinosaurs, most dinosaurs in this era were pipsqueaks. Carnivorous dinosaurs were turkey sized, while the ancestors of the likes of Stegosaurus and Triceratops were similarly small bodied. It was only in the later part of the Triassic that the sauropodomorphs started to push the limits of bigger body sizes, diversifying into a wide range of forms that caused a major evolutionary shift From small, bipedal ancestors, sauropodomorphs like Ingentina became quadrupedal giants. The new finding pushes back the emergence of giant body size. Until now, University of Witwatersrand paleontologist Jonah Choiniere says, the largest known sauropodomorph was an animal called Antetonitrus from the Jurassic. The appearance of animals of slightly larger body size appearing much earlier is really interesting, Choiniere saysparticularly because increasing dinosaur body size and different shapes occurred prior to the end Triassic mass extinction that was thought to finally give dinosaurs a competitive edge. So now we know that sauropodomorphs grew to giant sizes at least twice. And interestingly, the Traissic giants may reveal a different route to getting big. Until now, Apaldetti says, it was thought that truly giant dinosaurs didnt evolve until about 180 million years ago. This is when the quadruped, column limbed sauropods started their Jurassic inflationthink Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus as Late Jurassic examples of this body type. But Ingentia prima lived at the end of the Triassic, between 210 and 205 million years ago, Apaldetti says. Whats fascinating to paleontologists isnt just when these saurs got their growth spurt in evolutionary timeits how they grew in the dinosaurs lifespans. Like virtually all dinosaurs, sauropodomorphs like Ingentia hatched out of relatively small eggs. When Apaldetti and colleagues looked at Ingentia and related dinosaurs called Lessemsaurids, though, they found that these dinosaurs didnt grow the same way as their later relatives. Previous studies showed that dinosaurs like Diplodocus grew rapidly and continuously to get to huge sizes. Giants in the Traissic did things differently. Their growth was seasonal they packed on the pounds when the seasons were favorable and stopped growth when conditions took a turn, like trees. This actually helped them increase their size at a speed even higher than that of the giants that grew continuously, Apaldetti notes. There was more to this strategy. The lessemsaurids included in the study had a bird like respiratory system, including air sacs that invaded bones to make skeletons lighter without sacrificing strength as well as making breathing more efficient and acting as an internal cooling system. Paleontologists have long known that later sauropods benefitted from these structures, but the new research indicates they were a critical part of Triassic sauropodormoph biology, too. Ingentia and its closest relatives show that just growing extremely rapidly and an improved avian like respiratory system was necessary to achieve big body size at an early moment of their evolutionary history, says Apaldetti. Bones can help illuminate the biological features that allowed dinosaurs to get big, like air sacs and rapid growth rates. But the environmental reasons why the Triassic was a good time to get big are still hazy. There probably wasnt a single reason, Apaldetti says, but several, such as higher temperatures and more nutritious plants. I would suggest that higher global temperatures and greater primary productivity of plants are likely what drove body size evolution, Choiniere adds, but at this point that hypothesis still needs testing. For now, the discovery of Ingentia adds to the deep significance of the Triassic. This was not only the time of the first giant dinosaurs, dome headed weirdos and vacuum faced oddities, but also when the ancestors of animals alive todaybirds, crocodiles, mammalsflourished. It was a time of exuberant and varied life that set up the following 200 million years, with creatures like Ingentia underscoring how ancient diversity set up what would later come into being. Evidently, Apaldetti says, the Triassic period was a lab for vertebrates, the moment in which most of the current vertebrate groups were designed and re designed by the chaotic whims of evolution."}, {"title": "Ancient Toddler Was at Home on the Ground and in the Trees", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "July 5, 2018", "doc": "One of the key traits that separates hominins from apes is bipedalism, or walking upright on two legs, freeing the arms to throw spears, pick berries or carry children. That transition from stable quadruped to confident biped took a long time as new members of the human family tree evolved. Now, reports National Geographic, a new study shows that toddlers of one famous early bipedal species, Australopithecus afarensis, retained some ape like foot structures that likely allowed them to climb trees or cling to their mothers more securely. Lucy, the first and most famous A. afarensis fossil, was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. Over a quarter century later, in the early 2000s, researchers uncovered the foot of another A. afarensis fossil, a 2.5 year old girl in Ethiopias Dikika region, which researchers named Selam. And in a new study, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, Jeremy DeSilva of Dartmouth and his team analyzed Selams well preserved foot bones, each about the size of a human thumb, and found that while the foot looks good for bipedalism, Selam probably had some qualities similar to baby apes as well. This foot is very human like and indicates that the Dikika child was walking on two legs, DeSilva tells George Dvorsky at Gizmodo. However, the bone at the base of our big toecalled the medial cuneiformhas a connection for the big toe that is more curved and slightly more angled than what is found in humans today. Such a curved surface would allow motion of that big toewhich modern apes use for grasping. We conclude from this, and from previous studies on the shoulders of the Dikika child, that she would have been able to climb, and to also grasp onto her mother during travel. Dvorsky reports, however, that the foot bones of adults dont seem quite as ape like. The grasping toes, the researchers believe, helped young A. afarensis children to scurry up trees to avoid predators, which they probably had to do more often than adults. It also may have helped them grasp onto their mothers since they were probably carried around a lot, like baby chimpanzees. It also turns out that Selams heel is different from those of adult A. afarensis. Kimberly Hickok at LiveScience reports that it is much more delicate than the adult heel, which is similar to ours. So that suggests A. afarensis grew their heels very differently than we do, DeSilva tells Hickok. Even though we have the same anatomy they had, we got it differently. While juveniles spent more time in trees, its likely the adults took to the branches as well. In 2012, after 30 years of intense debate about whether Lucy and Selam were strictly bipedal or also arboreal, a study of their shoulder blades showed they could swing through the jungle with the best of them. Its likely they spent the day foraging on foot and climbed into the trees to sleep. If you were living in Africa 3 million years ago without fire, without structures, and without any means of defense, youd better be able get up in a tree when the sun goes down, DeSilva says in a press release. However, even if the species did sleep and hide in the trees, that doesnt mean having two feet planted on the ground wasnt important. In fact, Carol Ward of the University of Missouri who is currently examining Selams spine and ribs tells Hickock that the childs grasping power doesnt really compare with apes. Even if a baby could have fit more things between its first and second toe, it would not have had the grasping capability like an ape, she says, pointing out that Selams foot is more adapted to walking than climbing. It shows how important life on the ground was for these animals, and that effective climbing was much less important. Whatever their lifestyle, they were pretty successful. So far researchers have found fossils from 300 A. afarensis individualsthough very few childrenand the species lasted more than 900,000 years, three times as long as our own has walked the earth."}, {"title": "How Ancient Teeth Reveal the Roots of Humankind", "author": "Lorraine Boissoneault", "date": "July 2, 2018", "doc": "Ten thousand years ago, Mesolithic hunter gatherers of the Croatian Peninsula caught fish perhaps using their teeth to remove the scales and foraged for starchy plants. Scientists know this thanks to a handful of ancient teeth, whose plaque revealed microfossils of fish scales, fish flesh and starch granules. That calcified bacterial gunk is helping researchers understand the diet of these hunter gatherersonce thought to be a nearly impossible task, since there are so few human remains from the time period, and foodstuff doesnt generally survive in the fossil record. This finding, published in a recent Nature study, is just one of myriad discoveries made possible by the archaeological miracles that are teeth. Teeth are disproportionately prevalent in archaeological sites scientists often find dozens or hundreds for every skeleton or skull. Thats because the enamel covering a tooth is already 97 percent mineral, and teeth are stronger than bones, so theyre more likely to survive, writes anthropologist Peter Ungar in Evolutions Bite A Story of Teeth, Diet, and Human Origins. In other words, teeth are like the pennies of ancient human remains they turn up everywhere. But unlike pennies, theyre often a treasure trove. Everything from the tooths shape to its enamel thickness tells researchers something about the human whose mouth the tooth once inhabited what they ate, where they lived, what diseases they had. As paleoanthropologist Kristin Krueger puts it, teeth are little pieces of a puzzle that could help see the big picture of someones life. Krueger assembles those puzzle pieces with the help of a robotic device called ART, for Artificial Resynthesis Technology. The chewing simulator imitates a human jaw to reveal how noshing on different foods impact the teeth, looking to see whether those foods leave tiny abrasions on the machines teeth. This has significant implications in our understanding of hominin diets, especially those hominis who are thought to consume a large amount of meat, Krueger said by email. She and her colleagues have already discovered that meat doesnt leave microwear signatures, which could change how scientists analyze the teeth of hominins believed to be particularly carnivorous, like Neanderthals. Teeth may seem humble compared to more dazzling specimens like skulls, but the bony protuberances offer more than their share of surprises. Im constantly amazed by what I find when examining teeth, Krueger said. They truly are little windows into the life of an individual. Explore some of the most exciting discoveries made with the help of ancient chompers, and the technology thats making these insights possible. While the marine diet of ancient Croations is exciting news for scientists, other finds have proven just as spectacular. Take, for example, the Australopithecine Lucy. Chemical analysis of her teeth shows that, as far back as 4 million years ago, the diets of hominins suddenly became much more diversified than other primates. Apes living in trees were still ordering off the prix fixe menu of the jungle, whereas the more human like hominins had expanded their palate to the buffet offerings of jungle and savannah. Carbon signatures of the ancient teeth show that Lucy and her kin had expanded beyond fruits and soft buds of trees and shrubs to actually eating other animals the development of thicker enamel reflects that they had also developed more protection to eat seeds, nuts and roots. To what extent this dietary shift reflected active hunting, or the gathering of small prey such as arthropods, or scavenging, or a combination of all these, is still unclear, but something plainly happened, writes paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall in The Strange Case of the Rickety Cossack and Other Cautionary Tales from Human Evolution. The dental record can also reveal important markers of health to anthropologists. In one study, researchers looked at dentinethe tissue that forms beneath enamelin modern Greek people, compared to prehistoric Middle Eastern communities. Modern Greeks had levels of vitamin D deficiency that were four times higher than their ancient ancestors, perhaps due to spending more time indoors or changes in clothing, though researchers have yet to find a definitive answer. Pre agriculture peoples also had significantly lower rates of cavities, and researchers have begun extracting bacterial DNA from calcified plaque to see how strains of bacteria changed after the introduction of farming. Despite claims made by adherents of the Paleo Diet which, to be clear, is not reflective of an actual paleolithic diet, not all health outcomes of prehistoric life were positive. Debbie Guatelli Steinberg, an anthropologist at the Ohio State University and author of What Teeth Reveal About Human Evolution, has seen firsthand how disease and malnutrition plagued Neanderthals. For this she studies linear markings on the enamel called hypoplasias, which occur when enamel formation stops for a short period due to genetic causes or environmental ones. Some disruptions in Neanderthals were quite long, almost up to three months, Guatelli Steinberg says of her research. Its difficult to interpret, but when theres a long period of time like that, it might be more likely that it has something to do with malnutrition. In 2015, researchers uncovered one of the most significant finds in dental archaeology 47 teeth in a cave in southern China. Identified as belonging to Homo sapiens, these teeth provided evidence that our species arrived in Asia much earlier than previously thoughtas far back as 80 to 120 thousand years ago. Other researchers have studied the bacteria of ancient plaque to understand migration among the Polynesian islands, and performed chemical analysis on teeth looking at strontium isotopes, which come from groundwater and get locked into the enamel. If the strontium changes between an individuals first molar and second one, that suggests migration from one place to another. Another way is to look and see how much variation there is in females versus males, Guatelli Steinberg says. If theres more variation in the females than the males, that might mean the females were migrating from different areas. How do we know whether the individual in question is female or male? It turns out that question can also be answered chemically by testing one of the enamel forming proteins. Teeth also offer tantalizing insights into behavior. Krueger, for example, has examined the wear on Neanderthal teeth to understand how they used their mouths as an extra tool. While those individuals living in more cold and open conditions used their front teeth for clamping and grasping most likely using their front teeth as a third hand during animal hide preparation for clothing or shelter, those in more wooded and warm environments were occasionally using their teeth to soften fibers or wood, or perhaps to retouch tools, Krueger said by email. Evolution and Species ID Compared to modern humans, many hominins had toothier mouths. The Nutcracker, aka Paranthropus boisei, a hominin that lived 2.3 million years ago, had the largest molars and thickest enamel of any hominin. Homo erectus, which lived all over the world 1.5 million years ago, had larger canines than modern humans. But both still followed the evolutionary trend of generally decreasing tooth size The size of our jaw and teeth have slowly been shrinking over millions of years. Modern humans normally end up with 32 teeth by the time theyre fully adult, including four wisdom teeth that often have to be removed because there just isnt room for them.  This has largely been attributed to changes in dietary strategies, Krueger said. Why did our dietary strategies change? They were adaptations to changing environmental conditions that are well documented during the Plio Pleistocene. Thanks to the huge variations in teeth between modern Homo sapiens and all its ancestors, teeth are a wonderful tool for identifying species. But how do scientists know if a particularly large or small tooth should be classified as a different species, or is just an example of variation within a species? That was certainly the question surrounding a single 750,000 year old molar discovered in 2015. It was the smallest molar ever found in Africa during the Middle Pleistocene, which increases the amount of variation among all samples for the region. As to which species it belonged to, that has yet to be determined. According to Krueger, theres no clear cut answer for these tricky questions of identification. Think about the size difference alone that one can find in living humans. Think a basketball player versus a horse jockey Krueger said. All paleoanthropologists agree that variation existed in the past, but disagree as to the boundary line between variation within one species versus enough variation to represent a different species. Besides jaws that dont leave enough room for our teeth, another hallmark of modern humans is our exceedingly long developmental process, which is reflected in how long it takes us to get a full mouth of adult pearly whites. We have these long childhoods in which we learn and master skills for our survival, and we seem to have the longest periods of development of any nonhuman primate, says Guatelli Steinberg. Knowing how long it takes modern humans to outgrow their baby teeth and gain a complete set of adult molars is useful in looking at the archaeological record and comparing other species development to our own. Scientists track this change using a neonatal line that forms on the first molar at birtha faint line thats visible under the microscopewhich Guatelli Steinberg compares to a birth certificate. That line is the starting point from there, scientists can count the subsequent perikymata, enamel lines that form on a daily basis like tree rings, to learn how developed a childs teeth were at the time of their death. For example, a jawbone with teeth found on Gibraltar and attributed to a young Neanderthal child was given the age of three years at its death, and showed slightly more accelerated tooth eruption than in Homo sapiens. Other researchers have used similar methods to argue that development most similar to that of modern humans began following the emergence of Homo erectus. While Erectus still had faster tooth development than our species, they were slower than the hominins that came before. Guatelli Steinberg and her colleagues recently submitted a paper on the dental development of Homo naledi which seems to distinguish it from other early hominins, and she hopes their work will be just the beginning of studies into this newly discovered species.

In academic journals, galleries of paleoart, and even the now 25 year old Jurassic Park franchise, T. rex has come to represent the ultimate epitome of dinosaurness. University of Nevada, Reno historian of science Jane Davidson puts it this way If you say dinosaur to most people, I would bet you that the mental image they have first is of T. rex. The tyrant even reigns on Twitter, where Sue the T. rex has amassed nearly 41,000 followers.  From snout to tail tip, T. rex was certainly a superlative animal. It lived between 68 and 66 million years ago in western North America, the range of the species extending from whats now southern Canada through New Mexico. And yes, it was a giant The largest and last member of its family, a fully grown T. rex could grow to be 40 feet long and weigh over 9 tons. The saur had a jaw powerful enough to crush the bones of other dinosaurs  and, while contested, calculations based on skeletal anatomy and muscle mass suggest that a T. rex in a hurry could have moved at speeds of 17 miles an hour or more.  But none of this explains how the king became aour shared cultural obsession in the first place. To understand that, we need to go back to the time the dinosaur was discovered, in the early 1900s. You see, while the dinosaur carries the title of king, we actually elected this saurian to be our favorite.  Paleontologists were on the trail of T. rex before they even knew it. In the late 19th century, teeth and isolated bones carried back from western expeditions during this time would, ultimately, turn out to be T. rex scraps. These were glimmerings of something fierce, during a time when only a handful of dinosaurs were known and each new discovery had the potential to not only reveal new species but entire families of dinosaurs. The two skeletons that revealed tyrants full glory were excavated by famed fossil hunter Barnum Brown in 1900 and 1902, respectively, and later described by paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1905.  There was a bit of initial confusion. Osborn called the first skeleton by the also catchy name of Dynamosaurus imperiosus, even accidentally including some ankylosaur armor in his vision of the dinosaur, while dubbing the second, better skeleton Tyrannosaurus rex. He soon realized his mistake, however, and in a follow up paper said both skeletons should be called Tyrannosaurus rex.  The first, less complete skeleton went on to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh  where it can still be seen today  and the better skeleton was reassembled in the dinosaur halls of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, where it was known as AMNH 5027. Decades before the discoveries of soon to be celebrity rexes Sue, Stan, Jane, the Wankel Rex, and others, AMNH 5027 became the most famous dinosaur of them all. Casts and reproductions of this dinosaur can still be seen at museums around the world. Why? Tyrannosaurus was far larger than any other predatory dinosaur found so far theres still plenty of debate over whether it still holds the title for the heftiest Cretaceous heavyweight. Moreover, compared to most dinosaur discoveries of the time, including other predatory dinosaurs, the first two Tyrannosaurus skeletons were relatively complete. As if this wasnt enough to prime Tyrannosaurus for the big time, it turned out Osborn was the ideal promoter for the dinosaur.  Henry Osborn was a wonderful publicist, Davidson says. The paleontologist was thinking big from the start at one point he even considered mounting both original T. rex skeletons in a single scene, facing off over a carcass. That idea was scrapped in favor of a single mount of the better skeleton, which the local press immediately enthused over. Even when only the hips and legs of the museums favored T. rex were up, the New York Times declared the dino the prize fighter of antiquity.  Osborn had the bones, the facilities, the funding, and the press attention to make T. rex a star, notes University of Maryland paleontologist and T. rex expert Thomas Holtz, Jr. The dinosaur even appeared as the villain in the 1918 movie The Ghost of Slumber Mountain, one of the earliest dinosaur flicks. The name was surely part of the dinosaurs appeal, too. Calling it the king of the tyrant lizards was genius, Davidson says  a name that was simple, evocative, and immediately told you exactly the kind of dinosaur you were looking at.   But the familiarity of T. rex slightly can obscure the true nature of the dinosaur. If T. rex had been discovered in the last 20 years or so, we would consider it a weird or extreme dinosaur, says Holtz. T. rex has extremely large and thick teeth for its skull size, an extraordinarily deep and wide skull, and lumpy ornamentation around the eyes that are more prominent than those of its relatives. Despite being the name bearer for an entire family of dinosaurs, Tyrannosaurus is among the strangest of its kind. Nevertheless, T. rex has become an ambassador dinosaur, known from over 50 partial skeletons and with a paper trail longer than the carnivores body. But fame comes at a price, Holtz notes. The huge bulk of literature gives us the impression that we know T. rex well, when, in reality, were still getting to know the basics. In other words, Holtz notes, T. rex has become the Drosophila melanogaster of vertebrate paleontology  the very measure of almost any question you could think to ask about the Cretaceous period  whether its the best study subject or not.   The king is also prone to generating controversy. In the early 90s, when paleontologist Jack Horner proposed that T. rex only scavenged for food rather than hunted, the outcry from other experts and the public alike was louder than a cinematic dinosaurs roar. Theres evidence T. rex both hunted and scavenged, like most modern carnivores, with the real question being how much of the dinosaurs diet was fresh versus carrion.  More recently, a 2016 conference presentation suggested dinosaurs like T. rex had fleshy lips covering their teeth and spurred debate among T. rex fans the description of a different tyrannosaur by Thomas Carr and colleagues proposed that these predators had more crocodile like faces with exposed choppers. Soon thereafter a 2017 study suggesting that T. rex was primarily scaly drew critique from those who think T. rex had at least a partial covering of fuzzy protofeathers. And dont even get started on the long running, vociferous argument over whether small tyrannosaur specimens from the same haunts as T. rex should be relabeled Nanotyrannus. Spoiler they shouldnt.  This kind of attention isnt unique to T. rex. Popular icons tend to stay that way, often following a concept called the 8020 rule  that is, about 80 percent of the effects come from 20 percent of the causes. In Davidsons other field, the history of art, she says, one gets more attention for example if you find a new Leonardo, or a purported new Leonardo, than if you find yet another painting by David Teniers II. The same goes for T. rex far more attention is given to a minor revision about the tyrant king than, say, Camarasaurus, or another dinosaur that doesnt have nearly the same cultural cachet.  In the century since Osborns announcement, T. rex has continued to metamorphose. New ideas about the species, as well as dinosaurs in general, have created an entire continuum of T. rex visions, from tail dragging sluggards to supercharged hypercarnivores covered in fuzz. Even this months release of Jurassic World II  which stars a T. rex that was accurate by 1993 standards but needs a few updates  helps highlight how our perceptions of those old bones keep shifting with the times. Even after all those years, its hard for those who study the king to resist its appeal. T. rex has always been my favorite dinosaur, since I was three years old, Holtz says. Originally it was just because it was, in the literal sense of the word, awesome. But as time went by and I began to learn more about anatomy and biology and the nature of science, I got to appreciate the species in new ways. T. rex appeals to both the high minded and the visceral parts of ourselves, and, Holtz says, the poetry of the species has a persistent draw.  Think of it, says Holtz The giant predator in a wonderful ecosystem which ended in fire and darkness. Who wouldnt love that?"}, {"title": "Oldest Footprints Show When Life On Earth Got Legs", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "June 11, 2018", "doc": "Around 540 million years ago, the oldest ancestors of almost every living creature on Earth burst onto the scene during an orgy of evolution known as the Cambrian Explosion. Unlike the single celled animals and microbes that lived before the geological age, these creatures had it all heads, tails, abdomens, shells, and lots of tiny little legs.  Thats at least the story told by the available fossil record. But because creatures from the immediate period before the Cambrian, known as the Ediacaran, were soft bodied, making their fossils smushy and hard to interpret, researchers have long suspected that the Cambrian explosion wasnt quite as explosive as it seems, and that in fact, some of these structures, especially appendages, may have evolved in the eons before the Cambrian period. Now, reports Hannah Devlin at The Guardian, researchers claim they have discovered teeny tiny tracks from the Ediacaran, the oldest footprints ever discovered and evidence that appendages evolved before the Cambrian shift. These particular fossilized prints were uncovered in the upper Ediacaran Dengying geological formation, which dates back some 551 to 541 million years ago, in the Yangtze Gorges area of South China. According to a press release, the prints consist of two rows of irregular tracks arranged in a series. The researchers believe that the tracks, just a few millimeters in length, represent a bilateral animalsome ancestor of worms or insectsthat was able to lift its body off the surface and walk along the bottom of the river in which it lived. There are also burrows associated with the tracks, meaning the creature may have dug into mats of microbes and sediment looking for oxygen and food. The study appears in the journal Science Advances. In the last two decades, researchers have found multiple sets of fossil bug prints, pushing back the appearance of appendages. LiveScience reports that in 2002, for instance, a little fossil trail discovered in Canada was 520 million years old. Though a set of tracks found in Nevada in 2008 was identified in 570 million year old rock, researchers dispute whether those were really bug tracks or just naturally occurring indentations. This latest find is the first to date firmly from the Ediacaran. The rock that contains the fossil has been very well dated between 551 and 541 million years old, lead author Zhe Chen of the Chinese Academy of Sciences tells AFP. Previously identified footprints are between 540 and 530 million years old. The new fossils are probably up to 10 million years older. Shuhai Xiao, geobiologist at Virginia Tech University and the papers senior author, tells Devlin that discovering these tracks helps researchers get a handle on Earths earliest history. Animals use their appendages to move around, to build their homes, to fight, to feed, and sometimes to help mate, he says, pointing out that the activity of even tiny animals can change the geochemistry of Earth and impact the climate. It is important to know when the first appendages appeared, and in what animals, because this can tell us when and how animals began to change to the Earth in a particular way. As to what that earliest little walker looked like, we may never know. According to the press release, while the footprints remain etched in stone, no fossils were found nearby, and its possible none will ever show up."}, {"title": "The Many Ways Women Get Left Out of Paleontology", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "June 7, 2018", "doc": "You cant talk about the early days of paleontology without talking about Mary Anning. Far from being just the inspiration for the tongue twister she sells seashells down by the seashore, the pioneering fossil hunter helped shape the young field, collecting and studying Jurassic remains in a time when science was openly hostile to women. Despite being kept out of scientific societies and seeing her stunning discoveries published by her male peers, Anning made herself a scientific icon. Her work digging up toothy sea monsters around the English countryside has been memorialized in book length biographies, novelsand even a 2018 film.   Itd be comforting to think that were beyond the days when Anning had to fight as fiercely to be recognized as the prehistoric creatures she uncovered. But the arc of history does not always bend toward equality. Two centuries after Annings trowelblazing efforts, the enterprise of paleontology still presents numerous challenges to women wanting to follow in her footsteps. Anning herself often ends up standing in for all women in paleontology by defaultjust as, when you ask someone their favorite female scientist, Marie Curie is often the only one they can name.  Yet while generations of researchers have chipped away at the male dominated culture of paleontology, a gap remains. Women today make up nearly half of student members in organizations like the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, but, Ohio University paleontologist Catherine Early notes, less than one quarter of professional memberspeople with staff jobs like curator or professorare women. The reasons range from subtle discrimination to direct sexual harassment, but they are all interrelated. From the classroom to the field, women are still trying to dig out from the attitude that paleontology is a boys club. Smithsonian.com spoke to multiple women paleontologists and researchers about what they see as the most pressing gender related problems in their field.  Unsafe In the Field  Its only in the past few years that the true extent of harassment in scientific fieldwork has come to light. Some of the best data we have comes from anthropologist Kathryn Clancy and colleagues, who in 2014 reported that in a survey of 666 field scientists across disciplines, 64 percent said they had faced some form of sexual harassment in the field and over 20 percent had been sexually assaulted. The pattern was clear victims were of lower professional rank than their harassers, many of whom felt they were in no position to report their abusers. Women trainees were the primary targets of abuse, the researchers found, while their perpetrators were predominantly senior to them professionally within the research team.  Vertebrate paleontology is no exception. Professional paleontology expeditions are generally run under the auspices of museums and universities. However, often held during the summer at remote dig sites, they have a much more relaxed feel, like a camping trip with a scientific mission. That isnt necessarily bad fieldwork generates stories and friendships as well as hard data. But it can also create dangerous situations where victims are isolated with harassers and predators.  How a field expedition is run and the way a camp is managed largely rests on the principal investigator, says Cleveland Museum of Natural History paleontologist Denise Su, who has been part of expeditions from Yunnan, China, to Manonga Valley, Tanzania. Each camp is as different as the people running them, with no discipline wide standard or enforcement. Yet a follow up study published by Clancy and colleagues in October 2017 found that these expeditions tend to have one thing in common They neglect to lay out clear expectations of professional behavior or policies of what to do about sexual harassment.  Having been on dozens of university  and museum led field expeditions and reporting on paleontology in the American West for seven years, Ive noticed this inattention during fieldwork myself. More time is given to field gear and how to use a GPS than acceptable conduct, where crises are often dealt with after the fact, if at all. Field workers are told to bring sunscreen, for instance, but not who to contact in the case of assault. In my experience, says AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow and paleontologist Shaena Montanari, a lot of field expeditions start without a proper emergency and sexual harassment plan being clearly laid out to everyone. Of those surveyed in the 2014 study, only 38 percent were aware of any code of conduct at their field site. Just 22 percent knew of any sexual harassment policy. Few respondents were aware of mechanisms to report incidents most who did report were unsatisfied with the outcome, Clancy and colleagues wrote in their study.  While more bad behavior is becoming exposed, she adds, victims often feel like they have little recourse. In 2017, Science Magazine reported on multiple accusations of verbal and physical harassment and assault against prominent geologist David Marchant. Four of the women told reporter Meredith Wadman that they considered reporting the abusebut ultimately waited years, or never did. They cited fears of career repercussions, as well as feeling dissuaded after meeting with faculty. The number of women have been so low as to prevent women from speaking outespecially when theyre alone, isolated with their harasser who might be running the trip, says University of Calgary paleontologist Jessica Theodor.  There can be institutional consequences to how reports of harassment are dealt with, depending on how the expedition was organized. University led trips fall under Title IXthe 1972 law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in educational institutions that rely on federal funding. That law makes the university legally responsible if it chooses to ignore incidents of sexual harassment or assault. In the case of museums, Theodor notes, action depends on an administration willing to do so. Theodor believes its the responsibility of camp leaders to be the example for those theyre leading. If Im setting the tone by not drinking heavily and acting in a particular way on an expedition, then people wont pull that, Theodor says. Binge drinkinga stereotype in the fieldand a climate where women are alienated or discriminated against, she adds, shouldnt be taken as a given. It doesnt have to be this way and shouldnt be this way. Subtle Discrimination  Of course, the discrimination women face in the field can be far less obvious than direct harassment at the hands of those like Marchant. Just being a women field paleontologist has layers of complexity, Su says. It starts long before expeditions pile into their vehicles and rumble off to the outcrop For many, success is cast against a background of constantly coping with unreasonable obstacles. You really have to want it to put up with a lot of crap, Su says.  Whether from members of the field crew themselves or people researchers need to work with in remote places, Su says, there is often an underlying assumption that women arent as skilled, tough or driven as the men. Theres a feeling that you cant stop or rest because youll be judged, Su says.  Briana Pobiner, a Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History paleoanthropologist, says this can be especially prominent in graduate school. I wanted to prove I could work just as hard as the male instructors in the field, Pobiner recalls. Despite this, men are often given more slack when it comes to field behavior as Ive also experienced during fieldwork. Theres an impression that male paleontologists can gain legendary status for being late, drunk or reckless, Su notes, yet women constantly feel excess pressure to be perfect in every respect lest they lose their invitation to dig. We take for granted that this is the way things are, Su says.\n\nThe isolation of the work doesnt help. Youre usually the only woman in the field, Su saysand there are some biological realities that just dont occur to men, from periods to pregnancy.  University of Georgia anthropologist Suzanne Pilaar Birch, for instance, has written about coping with pregnancy while in remote places. Men dont have to worry about what kind of anti malarial medication is safe when youre pregnant or trying to conceive, Pobiner adds. Pobiner is bringing her young son out to fieldwork in Kenya for the first time this year, and says the experience of other scientist mothers paved the way for her to do the same. She recalls being in the field with Kay Behrensmeyer over a decade ago, when she brought her husband and two then young daughters, and even though I was far from thinking about starting a family then, I was watching to see how she did it.  There are also the more daily realitieslike finding a place to pee that has enough cover, Su says, while worrying that such a delay will be looked down upon as holding up the team.  Beyond the disadvantage to women themselves, the lack of women on field teams can be a practical disadvantage to science. Its hugely beneficial to have a diverse set of people on a field team, says University of Toronto paleontologist Victoria Arbour. If everyone has the same background, your ability to come up with efficient ways to solve problems is going to be reduced. You need groups of people who are willing to work hard, use the tools and resources at hand, make good contingency plans, be organized and detail oriented, and think outside the box when things arent working out. Tough Guy Hunting Fossils  The public image of paleontologists as Indiana Jones type characters doesnt help any. Through decades of science popularization, were left with the image of a paleontologist as a scruffy white man in a cowboy hat. Paleontologists such as Jack Horner and Bob Bakker have even served as the inspiration for characters in the Jurassic Park movies, standing in as stereotypical paleos who represent the entire field in the minds of the public. The documentary and photography project The Bearded Lady Project is a cutting parody of this exact trope.  What that means is that for the publicand for those seeking to break into paleontologyis that the image of paleontology is overwhelmingly white and male.  When you watch many, many documentaries, even ones coming out this year, Montanari says, it looks like white men run the world of paleontology, which simply isnt true. The same group of talking heads can be seen on most basic cable dinosaur programs, like Discovery Channels Dinosaur Revolution, with women rarely included and almost never interviewed during fieldwork. I shouldnt be watching a dinosaur documentary in 2018 and seeing a grand total of zero women or people of color in the film, Montanari says. In reality, of course, women paleontologists have been contributing to and driving the field since the beginning, from Anning to the experts mentioned in this piece to others such as Emily Lindsey of the La Brea Tar Pits, University of Colorado at Boulders Karen Chin, Anusuya Chinsamy Turan from the University of Cape Town, and more. But recognition is hard won and relatively recentand the perception of the field has yet to catch up. The tide has pretty much changed already, many women are running large field programs and research groups, but men continue to get tapped for opportunities where they are publicly visible, Montanari says.  This includes public outreach events where museums overwhelmingly ask male paleontologists to speak instead of women. The annual PaleoFest meeting at the Burpee Museum of Natural History was criticized for falling short on gender representation, for example, and in 2016 held a Women in Paleontology session in response. These kind of one off events wont fully remedy the problem, but at least the 2018 slate of speakers is more even than it had been previously.  Still, the fight for fairer representation continues. As Arbour has pointed out, for example, the 2011 documentary Dino Gangs not only failed to feature any women paleontologists, but also ignored Yuong Nam Leethe leader of the International Dinosaur Project the film followed. But there is a simply way to remedy this issue, says Arbour Media savvy favorites who often get booked for interviews need to make more of an effort to share the spotlight. If I could offer some advice to people who get to have the opportunity to speak to the media regularly, Arbour says, it would be to also put forward names of colleagues who dont get that opportunity as often.  Whether dealing with practical concerns or outreach, paleontology is still stifled by diversity gaps. Members of the LGBTQ+ community, for instance, are only beginning to gain visibility and have been running their own annual gathering at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology conference.  These issues seep deeply into the discipline. If youre anyone other than a white male, its going to be a challenge to find anyone who looks like you to identify with in paleontology outreach. All white male panels are often not created with malicious intent or to purposely exclude people, Im sure, Montanari says, but if your ideal of a real paleontologist is seven white guys, take a minute to examine why that is. Chipping Away at The Problem  The representation gap is improving. The Bearded Lady Project, Trowelblazers, the appearance of paleontologists like Arbour on shows such as Dino Hunt Canada, and the book She Found Fossils by Eugenia Gold, Abagael West, and Amy Gardiner are all changing what once seemed set in stone.  Harassment policies, too, are slowly changing. In 2015, the initial survey by Clancy and her colleagues helped prompt the American Association of Physical Anthropologists to recognize the need for a specific statement against sexual harassment, in addition to their general code of conduct. The group published such a nine page statement that year, which was adopted by both the Paleoanthropology Society and Society of American Archaeology. It specifically cites the dangers of sexual harassment in field work and and offers concrete ways to combat harassment, including the recommendation that principle investigators enforce field site specific codes of conduct. In addition, just last year the American Geophysical Union moved to consider sexual harassment to be scientific misconduct on par with fabricating results or plagiarism. Unfortunately, these groups are not legal bodies and cannot legally enforce these policies. Theodor agrees that making clear rules ahead of time is a major step forward in changing the culture. At the University of Calgary, we put in place a formal policy in field schools, Theodor says, having students sign a policy that they would be responsible adults. The Signaling Safety study by Robin Nelson and colleagues backs this up, finding a drop in harassment and other forms of discrimination against women when clear camp rules were present and enforced. These changes reinforce a key truth discrimination against women paleontologists is a reality, but it is not inevitable. The paleontologists I spoke to said that those already in positions of prominence and power can take simple, tangible stepssuch as articulating and enforcing codes of conduct, and even recommending their women peers for gigs like documentary commentarythat will peel back barriers that have plagued the science from the start. The burden to make these changes cant all be on womencontinuing the exhausting push for equality requires men to be part of the conversation, too, stress Su and Theodor. With sexual harassment and assault so prevalent at field sites, I think its imperative that any principal investigator or field leader craft a crystal clear code of conduct, Pobiner says. Its not just a matter of expectations, but a way to safely report and respond to incidents in places often far removed from the classroom.  Paleontology at large has avoided having this conversationand creating and enforcing these standardsfor too long. Theres still a long way to go, with each field season raising the question of what kind of science paleontology will choose to be one that values equality and diversity, or a discipline that is as moribund as its petrified subjects.  Someone opened the door for me, Su says. I want to make sure it stays open, and opens wider."}, {"title": "A Mysterious Dinosaur Skeleton Was Auctioned Off to a Private Buyer", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "June 6, 2018", "doc": "The auction was certainly not short on dramatic flourishes. The event took place on the first floor of the Eiffel Tower and the star attraction, an as yet unclassified dinosaur skeleton, was displayed with its mouth agape and its fearsome set of teeth on view. As Reuters reports, an anonymous buyer purchased the skeleton for 2.3 million on Mondayand some paleontologists are concerned that the private sale will limit scientists ability to study the specimen. The skeleton was found in Wyoming in 2013 and dates to between 151 million and 156 million years ago, during the Jurassic period. It measures 28.5 feet long and is approximately 70 percent complete. According to Colin Barras of Science, the dinosaur is likely a close relative of the Allosaurus fragilis, a Late Jurassic carnivore. In a catalogue promoting the recent sale, the French auction house Aguttes states that the specimen is the sole representative of what is likely a new species of Allosaurid, or even a new genus altogether. Some experts, however, arent so sure. Kenneth Carpenter, a paleontologist at Utah State University in Price, tells Barras that the dinosaurs unique skeletal features could come from another animal that was fossilized at the same time. Many other questions surround the dinosaurs discovery and its recent sale. The excavation of the skeleton was reportedly legal, but the paleontologists who found it have remained anonymous. The buyer is an unnamed French art collector, according to the Agence France Presse, and the seller has only been identified as a British businessman. Auctioneer Claude Aguttes tells Reuters that the buyer plans to lend the specimen to a museum. Everyone will be able to see it, it will soon be lent to a museum, it will be studied by scientists, everything is perfect, he says. But the sale has sparked concerns among the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology SVP, which wrote a letter to Aguttes last month urging the auction house to halt the sale. Chief among the organizations concerns is that keeping the skeleton in private hands will impede future scientific studyeven if the owner allows researchers to access the remains. Scientific practice demands that conclusions drawn from the fossils should be verifiable scientists must be able to reexamine, re measure, and reinterpret them such reexamination can happen decades or even centuries after their discovery, the SVP explains in its letter. Fossil specimens that are sold into private hands are lost to science. Even if made accessible to scientists, information contained within privately owned specimens cannot be included in the scientific literature because the availability of the fossil material to other scientists cannot be guaranteed, and therefore verification of scientific claims the essence of scientific progress cannot be performed. The organization also took issue with Aguttes claim that the new buyer might be able to name the skeleton. This assertion is misleading because the naming of new species is governed by the rules of the International Code of Nomenclature, which award priority to the first validly published name, not to the owner of the specimen that formed the basis of the name, the SVP writes. The sale went ahead in spite of the SVPs concerns. According to Reuters, some proceeds from the auction will be donated to two charities that work with endangered species. But that is not likely to appease experts who worry about how private sales of dinosaur bones are affecting paleontological study. Selling fossils at high prices like this tends to create the perception that they have a commercial value, SVP President David Polly tells Barras of Science. Over the last 25 years its become increasingly hard for paleontologists to work on private land because landowners think there is money to be made and they want to charge for access."}, {"title": "How the Ancestors of Birds Survived the Dino-Killing Asteroid", "author": "Lorraine Boissoneault", "date": "May 24, 2018", "doc": "Sixty six million years ago, nothing seemed more unlikely than the dominance of bipedal apes and flying dinosaurs. Yet here we are.  The Cretaceous was a world of enormous terrestrial dinosaurs, some small mammals, and what we now recognize as the predecessors to modern birds. Some, like Hesperornis, were flightless creatures with a beak full of teeth that lived in the ocean. Others, like Icthyornis, were flying fish eaters. Most diverse of all were the group of birdlike animals called Enantiornithines, or opposite birds named because some of their bones are organized in the opposite manner as modern birds. They lived all across the globe, in over 80 different taxa, many of them adapted for life in the trees. Not a single one of those species made it past the Chicxulub asteroid that landed on the Yucatan Peninsula.  The asteroids impact created a blast one billion times stronger than the bomb at Hiroshimabut that was only the start of the devastation. What followed were global wildfires, years of nuclear winter and acid rain. Amazingly, around 30 percent of organisms did manage to survive, and those survivors included the ancestors to all modern life we see today. A new study speculates that the trick might have required being able to live on the ground. The study, published today in Current Biology, looks at evidence for widespread forest disappearance and the emergence of what we know now as modern birds. The researchers postulate that because forests were wiped out globally, birdlike creatures that required those perches for survival were forced into extinction, while the ground dwellers survived.  What I like about this paper is that it puts down a chip, a marker, says David Jablonski, a professor of evolution and paleontology at the University of Chicago who wasnt involved in the study. Heres a hypothesis and now it can be more fully explored.  For the authors of the new paper, coming up with the hypothesis in the first place involved assembling a team of specialists from across the world of paleontology, including those who study ancient pollen and birds. First, the paleobotanists, who studied rock samples from North Dakota. Nestled inside the dusty fragments are millions of microfossilspreserved remains of pollen spores, leaf litter, wood and other debris.  Because of their very small size and extreme abundance in sediments around 100,000 per gram of rock, it is possible to study the composition of the flora and its change through time with very high precision, as you can sample the rock record centimeter by centimeter, said Antoine Bercovici, a paleobotanist at the Smithsonian Institution and an author on the new paper, by email. Those microfossils from the boundary between the Cretaceous the last geologic period of the dinosaurs and the Paleogene the period immediately following the asteroid show a very particular pattern known as the fern spike. After millennia of spores from a wide variety of plants, suddenly 70 to 90 percent of the microfossil flora record comes from ferns. Thats because ferns reproduce with spores rather than seeds, which are much smaller and more easily spread through the wind, says Regan Dunn, another author on the paper and a paleobotanist at the Field Museum.  When theres a big forest fire or a volcanic eruption today, oftentimes the first things that come back are the ferns, Dunn says. That spike in fern growth is apparent across the world, and it suggests that the ferns were monopolizing a landscape devoid of trees and other plant life. As far as the scientists can tell, it wouldve been a fairly gloomy world, between the ash darkened skies and the unseasonable cold. But there was enough plant life left for vertebrates to eke out a living.  When you destroy the environment, that affects every other living organism. You also see a decline in the insect faunas, and we know that because you can look at fossil leaves and see insect damage on them, Dunn says. The plants feed the bugs, and the bugs feed the birds, and the birds feed the mammals, so when you take the base out of that, you have massive repercussions.  Daniel Field, a paleontologist at the UKs University of Bath, has long been interested in the question of how a devastating mass extinction that occurred millions of years ago could ultimately produce the breathtaking diversity of bird species we see today. With this study, he and his team begin to piece together the answer. Using statistical analysis of the fossil record, combined with data on the forests, the researchers concluded that non arboreal birdsthose who didnt live in treeswere much more likely to survive.  Thats not to say a ground dwelling lifestyle was the only thing required for making it out of the mass extinction. Body size and diet likely had something to do with it, as well as other factors.  After all, there were dinosaurs the size of small birds who didnt make it outand researchers arent yet sure why. Youve got to explain an extinction where the big dinosaurs went out, but the crocodiles didnt. Where the mosasaurus went out, but sea turtles didnt, Jablonski says. The fascinating thing to contemplate is, how do you have a mass extinction that removes 60 percent of organisms, but not 100 percent? Its got to be really severe, but on the other hand, some of them are still standing.  The next steps to filling in the picture will be figuring out what exactly happened to foreststhe researchers currently think it took at least 1,000 years before they began to recoverand how everything else survived in the meantime. Birds diversified rapidly shortly after the extinction event, but scientists still arent sure exactly when it happened and how it varied among species.  The importance of piecing together this period of the past is also critical for predicting the future. The researchers say what happened to birds at the end of the Cretaceous could help us understand how human made climate change might affect todays birds. What these kinds of studies show is that ecosystems, although remarkably resilient, really do have breaking points, Jablonski says. And that history should be considered extremely sobering."}, {"title": "The Case for Charles Dickens, the Science Communicator", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "May 18, 2018", "doc": "Charles Dickens had the uncanny ability to absorb the tiniest details of daily life and the mannerisms of people around Victorian London and present them on the page in literary Technicolor. In fact, Dickens eye for minutia even covered the science of the day, and in several characters and asides he explores fields like geology, medicine and paleontology. Thats why, reports Robin McKie at The Guardian, the Charles Dickens Museum is opening a new exhibition this month called Charles Dickens Man of Science. While devout Dickens fans may have picked up on Dickens keen interest in science, McKie explains that because the Victorian novelists writings are so associated with the plight of the poor, the sick, the homeless, the elderly, the overworked and the underpaid, scientific observations in his writings have, in fact, become obscured. For 150 years, it has been thought that Dickens was uninterested in or actually hostile to science, Frankie Kubicki, curator at the museum, tells McKie. That is a misunderstanding, and a travesty. He was one of the most influential scientific communicators of the Victorian age. Julian Hunt, emeritus professor at Gresham College, who has written considerably about Dickens relationship with science, affirms that Dickens was very much a student of the scientific advancements of his age. His brilliant essay on a new ology describes how a science moves from its first tentative steps to mature general concepts, when they are often transformed into other areas of science and human understanding   a very modern perspective, Hunt explains in one 2015 lecture. In another story at The Guardian, Hannah Devlin reports that Dickens descriptions of medical ailments in his writings are so precise they often predated the formal description of some diseases. His description of Joe, the fat boy who has trouble staying awake in the Pickwick Papers, was used by doctors in 1956 looking to find out why severely obese people can have trouble staying awake. The researchers originally named their findings after Dickens, calling the diagnosis Pickwickian Syndrome. Examples of Dickens scicom skills can be found throughout his texts. In 1848s Dombey and Son, Mrs. Skewton loses the power to speak and becomes paralyzed on her right side. That observation anticipated the 1861 discovery by researcher Paul Broca that the speech center is located on the right side of the brain. That hadnt been observed in the medical literature at all by then  that speech loss and paralysis can occur together, Adelene Buckland, an advisor to the exhibition from Kings College London, tells Devlin. While Dickens wasnt known to dabble in the sciences himself, he was also actively conversing with those who were. Devlin reports he corresponded with Michael Faraday, one of the early researchers of electromagnetism, traveled with chemist Jane Marcet, who wrote a series of books popularizing scientific concepts, wrote the obituary of the criminally overlooked paleontologist Mary Anning and read Dombey and Son to the mathematician and, by some reckoning, the first computer programmer, Ada Lovelace, on her deathbed. Dickens interest in science was not just academic in nature. In true Dickens fashion, he wanted to see how science could improve the human condition. As the Charles Dickens Museum writes, for Dickens, science mattered when it transformed lives by curing disease or cleaning streets, or opening up new vistas of wonder in a humdrum world. Concerns like medical treatment, malnourishment, and sanitation were his scientific preoccupations. He wanted to demonstrate that these problems werent due to moral failings or the corrupt character of individuals, but rather were products of a poorly designed society that had inadequate safeguards for its most vulnerable. Hes linking modern urban life and the social structure of the city with disease, Buckland tells Devlin. You dont get disease just because youre living a dissolute lifestyle, its because youre living in a slum thats been neglected. Its a social responsibility. Charles Dickens Man of Science runs from May 24 to November 11, 2018"}, {"title": "People Lived in This Cave for 78,000 Years", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "May 11, 2018", "doc": "Theres evidence human beings have occupied the city of Damascus in Syria for 11,000 years. But thats nothing compared to the Panga ya Saidi cave network in Kenyas Rift Valley. Ruth Schuster at Haaretz reports that its 1,076 square foot main chamber has been occupied by Homo sapiens for 78,000 years. A new study published in the journal Nature Communications offers a testament to how human technology and culture have changed over that time. The cave sits in a unique spot, an ecotone where grassland and coastal tropical forest meet. Because of that, occupants of the cave could exploit the resources from both environments. The location also spared the cave from climatic fluctuations over the centuries. While drought may have impacted the savannah or the forest at certain times, the international and interdisciplinary team of researchers found the site of Panga ya Saidi seems to have received plenty of precipitation. That may explain why humans decided to stick around more or less continuously since finding the spot. The oldest artifacts found in the cave are Middle Stone Age toolkits dating back around 78,000 years. A distinct change occurs in newer layers that emerged 67,000 year ago in the Later Stone Age, where toolkits become much smaller, showing a switch in technologies. However, following layers dating back 60,000 50,000 years reveal a mix of tool types, which pushes back against the idea posited by archaeologists that change happens during technological revolutions where a new technology is quickly and widely adopted. The jewelry that the cave dwellers wore tells its own story of change. The earliest bead ever discovered in Kenya, dating between 67,000 and 63,000 years ago, comes from the cave. Beginning 33,000 years ago beads made from shells plucked from beaches along the Indian Ocean about 9 miles away became the accessory of choice. Around 25,000 years ago, ostrich shell beads became all the rage, before the seashells came back into vogue around 10,000 years ago. Other decorative or ritual objects such as carved bones and chunks of red ochre were found throughout the layers, which also indicate that there were no significant cultural or cognitive revolutions at the Panga ya Saidi site. Taken together, the tools and decorative artifacts paint a picture of a culture that changed slowly over time. Another important find at the cave is what wasnt therelots of seafood. Despite being relatively close to the coast, we do not have evidence that the hunter gatherer populations occupying the cave were in any way dependent on coastal resources, co author Michael Petraglia of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History tells Schuster. Instead, they were reliant on inland, terrestrial resources in their tropical forest and grassland ecosystem. That adds to growing evidence that early humans did not simply follow coastal resources. Instead, it shows humans were adaptable and able to survive in inland habitats as well. The finds at Panga ya Saidi undermine hypotheses about the use of coasts as a kind of superhighway that channeled migrating humans out of Africa, and around the Indian Ocean rim, Petraglia says in the press release. Project principal investigator Nicole Boivin of Max Planck predicts this knowledge will cause a shift in the way human evolution is understood. The East African coastal hinterland and its forests and have been long considered to be marginal to human evolution so the discovery of Panga ya Saidi cave will certainly change archaeologists views and perceptions, Boivin says. People only stopped living in Panga ya Saidi in the relatively recent past reports Schuster, though it is still used by locals for religious ceremonies and burials."}, {"title": "How Do Scientists Identify New Species? For Neanderthals, It Was All About Timing and Luck", "author": "Lorraine Boissoneault", "date": "May 9, 2018", "doc": "Initially, scientists labeled the skull as human.  But there was something strange about it. The cavernous eye sockets sat beneath a bulging brow ridge the domed roof seemed more oblong and less rounded than a humans. Yet when Lieutenant Edmund Flint presented the skull to the Gibraltar Scientific Society the only note made by that group was where the so called human skull was foundin Forbes Quarry. This was 1848, more than a decade before Charles Darwins On the Origin of Species would first suggest that new species could evolve from other specieseven humans.  A victim of its era, the Gibraltar skull was discovered before scientists considered that other hominin species apart from our own had ever existed. But the fossil was actually the first adult Neanderthal skull ever foundand it spent the first 16 years of its afterlife hidden away in storage. Had researchers realized its significance a little earlier, we may not even call Neanderthals Neanderthals they mightve been Gibraltarians.  Today, it would be difficult to imagine overlooking the obvious differences between a Homo sapiens skull and that of a Neanderthal. We live in a world where scientists have identified numerous hominin species, from Homo erectus to Homo floresiensis more affectionately known as hobbits. But in the mid 1800s, most scientists had no inkling that humans had evolved from other species. At this time, fossils were still mostly collected simply for the sake of curiosity and collection, not necessarily to publish scientific tracts, says Lydia Pyne, a science historian and the author of Seven Skeletons The Evolution of the Worlds Most Famous Human Fossils. The scientific questions have to be primed. People inside and outside of scientific communities need to be ready to engage with these questions.  In other words, in 1848, scientists lacked the context in which to evaluate such an unusual skull. Darwin was still hard at work on Origin of Species. Victorian scientists were still wrapping their heads around Charles Lyells 1833 work Principles of Geology, which promoted the idea that Earths history could be reflected in the fossil record and provided solid evidence for Earth being much older than 6,000 years, as traditionally asserted through Biblical studies. But even Lyells findings couldnt help the Gibraltar Scientific Society with their unusual skull. Unfortunately, whoever discovered it didnt record any details about the rock layer that it came from.  By contrast, a fragmented skull and leg bones discovered in Feldhofer cave offered a new opportunity for scientific documentation. Discovered in the Neander Valley, the fossils were meticulously surveyed and recorded by German schoolteacher Johann Fuhlrott, who made the discovery, and anatomist Hermann Schaaffhausen, who described it in a scientific paper in 1857. Though neither went so far as to name a new species, Schaaffhausen did note that the skull differed greatly from that of modern humans.  The extraordinary form of the skull was due to a natural conformation hitherto not known to exist, even in the most barbarous races, Schaaffhausen wrote in his paper. The human bones and cranium from the Neanderthal exceed all other fossils in those peculiarities of conformation which lead to the conclusion of their belonging to a barbarous and savage race. Almost immediately, Schaaffhausen met with resistance from the scientific community. Famed pathologist Rudolf Virchow claimed the bones must belong to a Cossack soldier the odd shape could be explained by the fact that the soldiers legs curved from rickets and life on horseback. Most likely, Virchow claimed, the bones came from a soldier of the Russian army riding across Germany in 1814 during the Napoleonic Wars.  Meanwhile, back in England, the scientific community was undergoing an extraordinary upheaval. In 1859, Darwin released his bombshell. In 1861, paleontologist George Busk translated the Neander Valley paper from German to English in German, Neanderthal means Neander Valley. In 1863, Thomas Huxley published Mans Place in Nature, which went further than Darwin in arguing for the evolutionary connection between humans and apes. That same year, at the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, geologist William King proposed that the fossils from Germany belonged to a new species Homo neanderthalensis.  That call for a new classification opened up one of the longest standing debates in paleoanthropologywhat is the precise taxonomic position of Neanderthals and, by extension, what was their contribution to the development of anatomically modern humans, write John Murray, Heinz Peter Nasheuer and others in a 2015 article of the Irish Journal of Earth Sciences. These were controversial and revolutionary ideas for their time.  As the flood of arguments about the Neander specimen continued unabated, Busk made another important contribution he had the Gibraltar skull moved from its island home at the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula to London in 1864, where it could be further analyzed, and wrote about the fossil for the first time in a letter. He noted its similarity to the Neander bones, adding that skeptics would hardly suppose that a rickety Cossack engaged in the campaign of 1814 had crept into a sealed fissure in the Rock of Gibraltar.  Darwin and Huxley also examined the fossil, with Darwin calling it the wonderful Gibraltar skull. Both researchers concluded that it might belong to an extinct species of human, and Darwin certainly considered including it in his 1871 book The Descent of Man. But Darwin didnt ultimately end up focusing on the Neanderthal debate. Its really not Darwin pushing this question of Neanderthals, Pyne says. He says this is interesting, but in some ways its just one thing of many. What really pushed the conversation forward were continental European scientists who embarked on the quest to find more fossils.  The same summer that Darwin and the other members of the British intelligentsia were introduced to the Gibraltar skull, Falconer wrote to Busk about a possible designation for their new acquisition A hint or two about the names which I have been rubbing up for the Priscan Pithecoid ape like skull, Homo var. calpicus, from Calpe, the ancient name for the Rock of Gibraltar. What say you? He wasnt the only one to propose an alternate binomial nomenclature. Other scientists offered Homo primigenius and Homo transprimigenius as well.  But once the new species designation was finally accepted, nothing stuck better than Neanderthal. At least, once the new species designation was finally accepted. The presentation of the Gibraltar Neanderthal did little to settle the argument, at least in the short term, writes paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall in The Strange Case of the Rickety Cossack and Other Cautionary Tales from Human Evolution. He adds that even Busk didnt seem fully convinced, writing at one point that the Gibraltar specimen was still man, and not a halfway step between man and monkey.  The Neanderthal question wouldnt truly be settled until more fossils were found, especially that of the famed old man of La Chapelle aux Saints, a relatively intact Neanderthal skeleton discovered in 1908, including a skull that looked much like the one found in Gibraltar. As for the Gibraltar skull itself, now thought to belong to a woman from 50,000 years ago, it remains an example of what happens when new discoveries are made too soon, before the scientists are ready for the evidence.  If we go back into all of the bins of every collection of every natural history museum, would we find something else thats simply been miscatalogued or overlooked by history? Pyne wonders. I would speculate the answer is probably yes. There probably are things that historical circumstance has let us overlook. Imagine the consequences if just one were as significant as overlooking the first Neanderthal."}, {"title": "700,000-Year-Old Butchered Rhino Pushes Back Ancient Human Arrival in the Philippines", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "May 4, 2018", "doc": "On the Philippines northern island of Luzon, researchers have made an exciting find stone tools and bones from a butchered rhinoceros that date to 709,000 years ago, hundreds of thousands of years before modern humans evolved.  As Belinda Smith at the Australia Broadcasting Company reports, the find raises questions about what species of human made it to Luzon that long ago and how they traversed the ocean. But it also contributes to an increasingly complex picture of human migration. The original story for human evolution was very basic, that maybe there was one single migration into places like South East Asia, says Gilbert Price, paleontologist at the University of Queensland who was not involved in the study, Smith reports. But its becoming so much more complicated now. The remains arent the first evidence of ancient human activity found on the island, but they are the oldest researchers could accurately date. In the 1950s, a team of U.S. researchers discovered butchered animal bones and stone tools in the Kalinga region of Luzon. But with limited dating methods, they could only guesstimate the age, suggesting a range of 780,000 to 120,000 years old. Until this most recent find, Smith reports, the only strong evidence of hominin occupation came from a foot bone found in nearby Callao Cave on Luzon, which was dated to 67,000 years ago. In 2013, paleontologists decided to return to Cagayan Valley, near where the previous artifacts were found. For the first couple of weeks, we didnt see much, Gert van den Bergh, a paleontologist at the University of Wollongong in Australia tells Smith. But we kept going, and not long after, bingo Nearly a whole rhinoceros skeleton. That wasnt all. They also found 57 stone tools including 49 sharp edged flakes and six cores, or the stones the flakes were chipped from, and two possible hammer stones, according to a press release. The rhino skeleton had cut marks on 13 of its bones and both of its humerus bones were cracked open, giving feasting hunters access to its marrow. There were other animal remains as well, including deer, a turtle, a monitor lizard and a stegodon, an elephant relative with a weird sideways trunk. The researchers detail the find in a new paper published in the journal Nature. To come up with a date, the researchers analyzed both the clay layer where they found the items and the enamel of a rhino tooth. The tests suggest the remains are between 777,000 and 631,000 years old. Thats 300,000 years before researchers think modern humans, Homo sapiens, even evolved. So if modern humans didnt cut up the rhinoceros, who did? Van den Bergh tells Smith it was likely Homo erectus, the first hominin believed to have ventured out of Africa. As Jen Viegas at Seeker reports, the species was common in Asia by that time and had four potential routes into the Philippines. But recent studies also suggest Homo floresiensisalso known as hobbitscould have beat Homo erectus to the area. They were found on the nearby island of Flores in Indonesia ten years ago. Its also possible the rhino was butchered by some as yet undiscovered Homo species. As van den Bergh tells Smith, the species responsible for the butchery remains speculative since the researchers found no hominin fossil evidence, and many species created the type of tools found in the region. Theres also the question of how the ancient humans got to the island nation in the first place. As Thomas Ingicco, lead author of the study, tells Viegas, its most likely that they arrived accidentally, riding on natural floating rafts of mangroves tangles that could have broken from mainland Asia during typhoons or tsunamis. Much less likely, but still possible, is the idea that they came to the islands using a primitive boat. The latest find also raises the possibility that even older evidence of ancient human activity exists on the island. And researchers are on the case. As van den Bergh says in the press release Now we can go looking in older strata and see if we can find more artifacts, or even better, fossil evidence."}, {"title": "3-D Scans of Fossil Beaks Show How Modern Birds Came to Be", "author": "Julissa Trevi\u00f1o", "date": "May 3, 2018", "doc": "In the 1870s, scientists found the first Ichthyornis dispar fossiland they were thoroughly confused. The toothed, seabird like animal lived during the Cretaceous between 100 and 66 million years ago. And as Gretchen Vogel for Science, paleontologists initially thought the fossil was an amalgamation of two animals a small birds body with a marine reptiles jaw.  Even when they realized it was indeed one animal, another thing confused the scientists The original fossil was missing an upper jaw. This led to the assumption that early birds had a fixed upper jaw. Now, a team of scientists from the U.K. and U.S. are finally teasing through the confusing details of Ichthyornis dispar. The researchers have 3 D scanned four fossils of the bird to develop a much clearer picture of the confusing critter. And as The Guardians Nicola Davis writes, the study is helping researchers better understand how toothy dinos evolved into modern beaked birds. The research represents a pivotal moment in the transition from dinosaurs to modern day birds, according to a press release, and among other findings, shows that I. dispar actually had movable upper jaws. As John Pickrell reports for National Geographic, the latest study can be traced back to 2014 when Fort Hays State University undergraduate student Kristopher Super found a limestone embedded fossil of I. dispar in Kansas. His colleagues soon realized the surprisingly complete remains were something special.  The team shared the find with Bhart Anjan Bhullar of Yale University. And rather than removing the fossil from the limestone, Bhullar and his colleagues used computerized tomography to scan it.  Along with the newly found fossil, they also found and scanned three other fossils previously kept in museum collectionsnone of which had been identified as I. dispar. They also went back to look at the original fossil found in the 1870s. Now held at Yales Peabody Museum of Natural History, that fossil contained two key bones from the jaw that were missing in the newer scans. As Pickrell reports, out of nearly a hundred specimens of Ichthyornis previously found, most of these fossils were compressed almost flat, so researchers could only guess the shape of the head. But the latest study, published in the journal Nature, offers an unprecedented look at this ancient bird. Combined, the scans created a complete model of a skull of I. dispar, marking the first time that scientists have assembled a complete view of a skull. Right under our noses this whole time was an amazing, transitional bird, Bhullar, principal investigator of the study, says in a statement. It has a modern looking brain along with a remarkably dinosaurian jaw muscle configuration. What did the toothed ancient birds head look like? Sharp, curved teeth, filled its large jaws like its dino relatives. Only at the very tip of the snout does the beak become recognizable, covered in a hard layer of keratin similar to modern birds. And like modern birds, it could move its top and bottom jaws independently. It was flying around eating probably fish, shellfish and other things, plucking them out of the water with its abbreviated little pincer tip beak and then tossing them back into its mouth and crunching down on them with its powerful dinosaur like jaws, Bhullar tells Davis. As Vogel writes, the new research suggests that beaks appeared earlier than previously thought, probably around the same time as wings. Stephen Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh, tells Davis the latest find is an important contribution to the understanding of birds evolution. It shows us the face of the earliest birds. And its a bit different than I would have expected, says Brusatte, who was not involved in the study. The earliest birds had Frankenstein creature heads and it was only through a long and gradual period of evolution that the fully modern bird skullbeak, no teeth, huge brain, tiny jaw musclesevolved."}, {"title": "Fossil Tracks May Record Ancient Humans Hunting Giant Sloths", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "April 30, 2018", "doc": "New Mexicos White Sands National Monument is a desolate place sparse vegetation pokes up throughout its salt flats and white gypsum dunes. But the area wasnt always a barren landscape. At the end of the last Ice Age, about 10,000 to 15,000 years ago, it was home to the massive Lake Otero. When the water receded, it opened up an area of expansive mudflatsa canvas to record tales of life at the lake. Researchers recently identified a particularly curious tale ancient humans tracking a giant sloth. As Ed Yong reports for The Atlantic, scientists spotted a set of giant sloth footprints with human prints nestled inside, suggesting that the ancient people were closely tailing the lumbering beast. Last year, Matthew Bennett of Bournemouth University in the U.K. was excavating a set of the large apostrophe shaped ground sloth tracks when he noticed a human print within one of them. Upon following the track, he found another double print, and anothereventually uncovering 10 in all. The tracks suggest the human was following the sloth relatively closely, Yong reports. If the sloth was following the human, its massive footprint would have obliterated the human tracks. Conversely, if the human stepped into the sloth tracks at a later timeafter the sloth tracks had driedit would have left a distinctive pattern. It really does look like they were contemporaneous, Anthony Martin, a trace fossil expert at Emory University tells Yong. This is a common problem we have with dinosaur tracks We have something that looks like following behavior, but could have been offset by days or weeks. Here, the humans maybe had the sloth in sight. The research appears in the journal Science Advances. The larger question is what, exactly, the stone age human was doing tracking the beast. Ground sloths were very different from the ugly cute meme bait tree sloths we have today. These muscular giants had fierce claws and ranged in size from something akin to a golf cart to the size of an elephant. If humans actually hunted them, it would have had to be a team effort. In this most recent paper, Bennett and his co authors suggest just that. While most ground sloth tracks move in fairly straight or curving lines, the track with the human prints zig zag, which means that the animal may have been trying to avoid hunters. As Yong reports, another set of human printswhich were much fainter, as if the person was moving on tiptoesapproaches from the opposite direction. At the end of the sloth track the sloth prints move in a circle, and there are claw marks on the ground, which the researchers interpret as the sloth rearing up on its hind legs and flailing its claws around. Bennetts team interprets the prints as hunting ambush. While it was being distracted and turning, somebody else would come across and try and deliver the killer blow, he tells Matthew Stock at Reuters. Its an interesting story and its all written in the footprints. William Harcourt Smith, a paleoanthropologist at Lehman College and the American Museum of Natural History tells Laura Geggel at LiveScience that the study is well done, but there are potential alternative explanations. Its a little odd and seems unnecessary that the pursuer step directly in the sloth prints, which would have required a much wider than normal stride. It could just be a human goofing around. How many times have children, or even adults, followed in the footsteps of others in the snow or sand, simply for the fun of it? he asks. Bennett acknowledges thats a possibility. Its really difficult to rule that out, he tells Yong. But I think thats highly unlikely. These were fearsome animals. They had claws like Wolverine. I wouldnt have wanted to go head to head with one. It would be a very silly risk to take. As Sid Perkins at Science reports, the tracks also add to the long debate about whether the mass disappearance of megafauna, including mammoth, giant sloths, sabre toothed cats, giant armadillos, giant beavers and other huge animals went extinct because of the changing climate or if human hunting pushed them over the edge. While some researchers doubt that humans with stone tipped spears could successfully hunt some of these creatures, a 2016 study in Science Advances suggests that the one two punch of a rapidly changing climate and human hunting pressure ended the age of giants. The new study certainly isnt conclusive proof of the link, but it at least places humans and megafauna in the same place at the same time. White Sands may eventually reveal even more interesting interactions. The site contains hundreds of thousands of tracks, Bennett tells Geggel. It is likely the largest palimpsest of human and animal activity found in North Americaand perhaps the world. Editors note April 30, 2018 An earlier version of this article mistakenly stated the human footprint was 20 inches long. The human footprints are around 5 inches long while the sloth prints are up to 22 inches long."}, {"title": "Ten Chinese Museums Where You Can See a Dinosaur Fossil Up Close", "author": "Ginny Mohler", "date": "April 18, 2018", "doc": "Despite a trade plagued by forgeries and amateur digs that destroy excavation sites, paleontology in China is thrivingand so are its dinosaur museums. The fossil boom began in the 1990s. Since then, countless prehistoric species have been discovered, among them groundbreaking feathered dinosaurs which continue to give new clues into the evolution of birds. At the same time, dozens of fossil museums have sprung up across the country, with more opening every year. So tourists, take heart In China, you dont have to be a paleontologist to get up and close to some of these fossil beauties. The Guinness Book of World Records ranked this museum as the largest dinosaur museum on the planet. Its dinosaur fossils, petrified remains, and early bird specimens number in the thousands. Its hundreds of Jurassic feathered dinosaurs collected here are the most impressive of any Chinese museum, says Zhou Zhonghe, director of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology IVPP in Beijing. I wonder how many stories will be disclosed out of this collection in the future, he says.  Since opening its doors in 2011, this museum has come to boast a collection of over 10,000 paleontological fossils and remains in a whopping 50,000 square feet of space. Its exhibit highlighting the Top Ten Paleontological Biotas of Liaoning, spans more than three billion years. The Liaoning Giant Dinosaur Hall features eight giant saurs excavated in the province, including the 50 foot long Liaoningotitan, shown here to the public for the first time. Even the architecture of the buildings is meant to evoke a prehistoric reptile, curving like a dinosaurs spine and ribs juxtaposed against an ancient bedrock.   The Jehol Biotaplant and animal life from roughly 130 million years ago in the early Cretaceous periodprovides a crucial window into the evolution of birds. And this museum has one of the best collections of Jehol Biota fossils accessible to visitors, according to paleontologist Luis Chiappe, director of the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. In the Liaoning Province, no fewer than 53 species of birds from this era have been discovered so far.  Chiappe admires the Beijing Museums potential to engage visitors with that history. Looking at the stunningly well preserved fossils from the Jehol Biota you get transported back in deep time to the utterly different world of the dinosaurs, he says. Highlights include the Lufengosaurus huenei, the first dinosaur found in China, the 85 foot long Mamenchisaurus jingyanensis, pterosaurs, and ichthyosaursaquatic reptiles that dominated the oceans.  This museum, located in the southernmost tip of Liaoning Province, boasts the first five dinosaur eggs ever discovered in China. It also holds a find many thought was lost to the ages the specimens Endotherium niinomii and Teilhardosaurus carbonarius, preserved together on a slab of coal from a mine in Fuxin, Liaoning. The slab was initially unearthed by the Japanese during World War II. In the decades that followed, some believed it to be lost until it turned up in the collection room of the Dalian Natural History Museum. Resident paleontologist Shen Caizhi believes the most important specimen in this museum is the Psittacosaurus assemblage 30 juvenile specimens and one larger skull preserved together. Some paleontologists believe it is the first direct evidence of parental care behavior in dinosaurs, while others contend it represents a nesting structure and post hatching cooperation.  A particularly exciting specimen here is the holotype the specimen used to describe a species for the first time of Mei long. Mei is a small theropod dinosaur from Liaoning Province, found in a sleeping or resting posture. It is the most completely three dimensional preserved troodontid dinosaur specimen that I have ever seen, says Chinese paleontologist Shen Caizhi. Other treasures at the museum include Mamenchisaurus, the worlds longest necked and Asias largest dinosaur, Confuciousornis, the worlds earliest beaked bird, and the best preserved skeleton of Stegodon.  The worlds only pterosaur museum opened in 2016 in Beipiao, a city in the fossil rich Liaoning Province. These flying reptilesneither dinosaurs or birdslived from about 225 to 65 million years ago and are notable for their ability for powered flight, not just leaping or gliding. Some were as large as an F 16 fighter jet, and others as small as a paper airplane, according to the American Museum of Natural History. Only about 100 species of pterosaurs have been found so far, and more than 50 of those were found in China.  Its an incredible museumlike a dinosaur national monument but more impressive, says Jingmai OConnor, an American paleontologist with the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing. Constructed over a massive exposed site covered in dinosaur fossils, the museum has an abundance of species including fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. The first discovery of dinosaurs in Zigong was in 1915. In 1977, the first organized dig was conducted at the Dashanpu Dinosaur Fossil Site, but it wasnt until a subsequent dig in 1979 that the enormity of the fossils embedded there was revealed. Since 1989, Zigong has taken its exhibits around the world, travelling to more than 23 cities across five continents.  A farmers accidental discovery of a dinosaur near Jinzhou, Liaoning Province, led to the creation of this museum, which opened in 2008. A sprawling complex, it covers 10 acres and includes a fossil museum, a petrified wood forest, an underwater artificial lake, Mongolian yurts and a park. According to the museums website, visitors can experience the unique charm of fossils  and feel the mysterious geological processes of the geological layers.  When the worlds first feathered dinosaur, Sinosauropteryx, was discovered by a Liaoning farmer in the mid 1990s, half of the specimen found its home here. The Sinosauropteryx was preserved within two slabs and each was sold separately. One of the oldest natural history museums in China since its opening in 1916, the museum hosts over 200,000 geological specimens, including the Shantungosaurus giganteus, a species of giant dinosaurs measuring 48 feet long. In addition to public displays, the museum houses a research organization.  Dedicated to integrating scientific research and popular science, the museums highlights include the worlds largest nest of dinosaur egg fossils, the world earliest ginkgo fossils, dozens of feathered dinosaurs, and the RuyangosaurusAsias largest sauropod dinosaur and one of the biggest sauropods in the world. Interactive experiences include multimedia exhibits The World of Dinosaurs, Running with Dinosaurs, Weight to Dinosaurs, and Dinosaur Puzzle. The collections comprise more than 50,000 geological, mineral, and paleontological specimens from inside and outside the Henan Province."}, {"title": "The Great Chinese Dinosaur Boom", "author": "Richard Conniff, photography by Stefen Chow", "date": "May 2018", "doc": "Not long ago in northeastern China, I found myself being driven in a Mercedes Benz SUV down a winding country road, trailed by a small motorcade of local dignitaries, past flat roofed brick farmhouses and fields full of stubbled cornstalks. Abruptly, we arrived at our destination, and my guide, Fangfang, slipped out of her high heels into fieldwork gear pink sneakers with bright blue pompoms on the Velcro straps. We were visiting a dinosaur dig, but there was also a museum under constructionsteel beams riveted together to form layers, stacked one atop another, climbing a hillside in two parallel rows. The two wings connected by a central pavilion looked like a bird about to take off. The new museumits name roughly translates as Liaoning Beipiao Sihetun Ancient Fossils Museumis due to open sometime in 2019. It was unmistakably huge. It was also expensive Fangfang estimated 28 million for construction alone. And it was in the middle of nowhere. We were in a rural village called Sihetun, about 250 miles northeast of Beijing. In the exuberant fashion of a lot of modern development in China, the new structure is going up in anticipation of visitors arriving by speed train from the capital, except that the speed train network hasnt been built yet. The new museum is located at an epicenter of modern paleontological discovery, an area that is at least as rich in fossils, and in some ways as wild, as the American West during the great era of dinosaur discovery in the late 19th century. In the mid 1990s, on that hillside in Sihetun, a farmer stumbled onto the worlds first known feathered dinosaur, a creature now named Sinosauropteryx the China dragon bird. Actually, the farmer found two halves of a slab, each preserving a mirror image of this dinosaur. In the freewheeling spirit that has characterized the fossil trade in the area ever since, he sold one half to one unwitting museum, and one half to another. It was the start of a fossil gold rush.The region has yielded more than 40 dinosaur species to date. Standing on a slope a few minutes walk from the museum site, my guide pointed out the hills of a nearby farm where Yutyrannus, a 3,100 pound feathered dinosaur, turned up a few years ago. Think Tyrannosaurus rex, but plumed like a Mardi Gras Indian. This was also the former home range of Anchiornis huxleyi, a chicken size creature with enough preserved detail to become the first dinosaur ever described feather by feather in its authentic colorsan event one paleontologist likened to the birth of color TV. What has emerged from beneath the fields of Liaoning province and parts of neighboring provinces is, however, bigger than dinosaurs A couple of decades of digging have uncovered two miraculously well preserved ancient worlds. The first, called the Yanliao Biota, is from the middle late Jurassic period, 166 million years ago. The second, the Jehol Biota, is Cretaceous, from 131 million to 120 million years ago. The Jehol is more famous among paleontologists, and far more diverse. Among the ancient biotaor plant and animal lifefound so far four turtle species, eight amphibian species, 15 fishes, 17 mammals, 24 of the winged reptiles called pterosaurs and no fewer than 53 ancient bird species. Taken together, these finds tell dramatic new stories about the dinosaur origin of birds and the evolution of feathers and flight. Thats in addition to some of the earliest flowering plants, plus assorted pine, cypress and gingko trees, algae, mosses and ferns, snails, clams, crustaceans, insects, spiders and almost endlessly onward. Its a measure of this diversity that, in addition to its other displays, the museum in Sihetun will house 26 different specimensfrom fish to a parrot faced dinosaur called Psittacosaurusall partly excavated but still embedded in the hillside where they were discovered. Heres another measure of that diversity Liaoning already has at least ten other fossil museums, some with important collections, others mainly products of local boosterism or bureaucratic career building. Theres typically lots of money for constructing new buildings, less for acquiring collections, and none at all, at least in the provinces, for scientific staff to make sense of them. Many of the best specimens also turn up in Beijing, or at the Shandong Tianyu Nature Museum seven hours south of the capital, which one paleontologist described as the best place to see Liaoning fossils.  One chilly December morning, a week into my trip, I looked out a hotel window in Chaoyang, a city of three million about 45 miles west of Sihetun. The mist rose off a bend in the Daling River and the sunrise lit up the mountains. Some say Chaoyang gets its name from an old poem about a mythological bird singing to the rising sun. Its known today as a city for fossils, and some of its most celebrated inhabitants are extinct birds. These fossils might not wow visitors whose idea of paleontology is limited to massive dinosaur reconstructions at other natural history museums. What Liaoning province typically produces are articulated skeletons in slabs of stone. I first saw one lying flat in a glass display case at the Beijing Museum of Natural History, too high off the ground for children to see, and often obscured for adults by lighting ingeniously positioned in precisely the wrong spots. Then I looked more closely. The backgrounds of the slabs, in mottled shades of beige, brown and ocher, were like old monochrome watercolors, or like a landscape scroll painted in the Tang dynasty. The fossils stood out against this background like bold strokes of calligraphy, and they were stunningly intact. It looks like somebodys chicken dinner, a friend remarked when I showed him a photo of one such fossilized bird. It looked, in truth, as if something had swatted the bird out of the sky and instantly entombed it in rock, which is more or less what happened, over and over, to vast numbers of such creatures, across tens of millions of years. In the early Cretaceous era, northeastern China was mostly forest and lake country, with a temperate climate. But it was prone to ferocious volcanic eruptions. Lake bed mud and volcanic ash quickly entombed victims without the oxygen necessary for decomposition, and these fine grained sediments preserved not just bones, but also feathers, hair, skin tissue, organs and even stomach contents. The Chaoyang native Microraptor, for instance, is a small, four winged dinosaur, a tree dweller built for short predatory plunges from branch to branch. Researchers examining one specimen recently found evidence in its abdomen that its last meal was a bird swallowed nearly whole. They also identified the bird. A mammal called Repenomamus, resembling a modern bulldog, turned out to have eaten a small dinosaur. For paleontologists, the value of Liaoning fossils lies not just in the extraordinarily preserved details but also in the timing Theyve opened a window on the moment when birds broke away from other dinosaurs and evolved new forms of flight and ways of feeding. They reveal details about most of the digestive, respiratory, skeletal and plumage adaptations that transformed the creatures from big, scary meat eating dinosaurs to something like a modern pigeon or hummingbird. When I was a kid, we didnt understand those transitions, says Matthew Carrano, the curator of dinosauria at Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. It was like having a book with the first chapter, the fifth chapter and the last ten chapters. How you got from the beginning to the end was poorly understood. Through the Liaoning fossils, we now know there was a lot more variety and nuance to the story than we would have predicted. These transitions have never been detailed in such abundance. The 150 million year old Archaeopteryx has been revered since 1861 as critical evidence for the evolution of birds from reptiles. But its known from just a dozen fossils found in Germany. By contrast, Liaoning has produced so many specimens of some species that paleontologists study them not just microscopically but statistically. Thats whats great about Liaoning, says Jingmai OConnor, an American paleontologist at Beijings Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology IVPP. When you have such huge collections, you can study variation between species and within species. You can look at male female variation. You can confirm the absence or presence of anatomical structures. It opens up a really exciting range of research topics not normally available to paleontologists. But the way fossils get collected in Liaoning also jeopardizes research possibilities. OConnor says its because it has become too difficult to deal with provincial bureaucrats, who may be hoping to capitalize on the fossil trade themselves. Instead, an army of untrained farmers does much of the digging. In the process, the farmers typically destroy the excavation site, without recording such basic data as the exact location of a dig and the depth, or stratigraphic layer, at which they found a specimen. Unspectacular invertebrate fossils, which provide clues to a specimens date, get cast aside as worthless. As a result, professional paleontologists may be able to measure and describe hundreds of different Confuciusornis, a crow sized bird from the Early Cretaceous. But they have no way to determine whether individual specimens lived side by side or millions of years apart, says Luis Chiappe, who directs the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. That makes it impossible to track the evolution of different traitsfor instance, Confuciusornis toothless modern bird beakover time.   In Chaoyang, late one afternoon, I visited a darkened, minimally heated apartment to find precious fossils stacked on every available surface. On the coffee table, next to some vitamin pills and a water bottle, was a 160 million year old Anchiornis, its dinosaur tail and its plumy smudge of feathers preserved in exquisite detail. Nearby, the twin halves of a split fossil lay side by side, displaying a fish that now seemed to be perpetually swimming toward itself. A childs sparkle painted pink bicycle stood on the balcony, and it occurred to me that the only way its owner could get it to the front door would be by wheeling it through a treasure house of perfectly preserved life forms from scores of million of years in the past. A ground breaking and expert study by a leading paleontologist and geologist, the book includes all the best known creatures as well as hundreds of lesser known and obscure species, and the latest up to the minute discoveries. The apartment belonged to the childs father, a museum director, who was holding the specimens for the new museum at Sihetun. Lu Juchang, a paleontologist visiting from the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, picked up a specimen from the floor and, pointing to different parts of the anatomy, said, This part is real, this part is not. To me, the difference was indiscernible, but to Lus eye, it leapt out I think someone went to find another specimen, cut a groove, and cemented in a suitable looking wing bone. The museum, he said, would have a preparator remove the fake parts and preserve whats authentic. This kind of forgery is routine, and only a handful of Chinese experts can spot it with the naked eye. Other researchers rely on ultraviolet light, which reflects the light differently from fake and authentic sections of the same slab. Its just a fact, adds OConnor, that most of the people buying these specimens are not scientists, or they are scientists with quotation marks. Im constantly being shown a specimen by someone who says, You have to describe this. This is a Jeholornis with a weird furculathat is, a wishbone. She tells them its actually a Jeholornis with a furcula manually added. In the early days, she says, forgers actually painted feathers on some specimens. Youd do the water test and the feathers would come right off. Now they dont use water soluble inks. Nonetheless, theres genuine fossil wealth being revealed in Liaoning. Many of the slabs have been transferred to Beijing, where preparators are getting them ready for display. One morning in the basement of the IVPP, I watched a young man stare through the dual lenses of a microscope as he worked an air pressure tool along the length of a wing bone. The needle pointed tip whined and flecks of stone flew out to the sides, gradually freeing bone from matrix. Nearby a woman used an old credit card to apply a tiny drop of 502 Super Glue to a break in a fossil, then went back to work with a needlelike pick in one hand and an air pump in the other. Eight preparators were working at that moment at different fossils. It was an assembly line, dedicated to opening old tombs and bringing whole empires of unimaginably strange and beautiful creatures almost back to life.

But as John Pickrell at National Geographic reports, paleontologists in England recently discovered a bone from an ancient sea monster that seems to have been just as big, hinting at the possibility other ancient sea creatures were just as massive. In 2016, amateur fossil hunter Paul de la Salle was walking the beach in Lilstock, a town in Somerset in the southwest of England, when he found a large fossil. He believed it belonged to an ichythosaur, a dolphin shaped carnivorous marine reptile with a long, toothy snout that lived in the oceans during the age of the dinosaurs. He continued to search the area, discovering more pieces of the fossil, which, when fit together, make up a 3.2 foot section of jawbone. De la Salle got in touch with ichthyosaur experts Dean Lomax at The University of Manchester and Judy Massare, professor emerita of geology at SUNY College at Brockport. According to a press release, the researchers dated the bones to 205 million years ago, and estimate that in life the Lilstock ichthyosaur would have been up to 85 feet long, edging well into blue whale territory. A description of the fossil appears in the journal PLOS One. This bone belonged to a giant, Lomax tells Reuters. The entire carcass was probably very similar to a whale fall in which a dead whale drops to the bottom of the sea floor, where an entire ecosystem of animals feeds on the carcass for a very long time. After that, bones become separated, and we suspect thats what happened to our isolated bone. This new specimen is about 25 percent larger than the previous largest ichythyosaur, a 69 foot long creature including half a skull, backbone ribs and part of the tail called Shonisaurus sikanniensis found in British Columbia, reports Laura Geggel at LiveScience. A comparison with the back of the Shonisaurus jaw indicates that our specimen is larger, Massare, a co author of the study, tells Geggel. But we know much less about it because it is just one bone. As Pickrell reports, the find has led the team to reassess other fossils found along the English coast. In particular, they reexamined a group of large bones found in cliffs near the village of Aust in Gloucestershire, England. These were previously interpreted as being limbs from terrestrial dinosaurs, but the classification never perfectly lined up. We compared it with these Aust bones, and as soon as I saw it in person, my jaw just hit the floor, Lomax tells Pickrell. I realized this was a giant ichthyosaur and the biggest thing ever found in the U.K. The Aust fragments may have once belonged to creatures even larger than the Lilstock beast. Paleontologist Darren Naish from the University of Southampton, who has studied the Aust bones and come to the same conclusion, tells Pickrell that these new finds are astonishing and agrees that they suggest that these ichthyosaurs neared or even exceeded modern baleen whales in size. If thats the case, its a big deal. Many researchers are investigating the question of how baleen whales got so big. Studies suggest for the whales, their massive size is a relatively recent phenomenon, perhaps fostered by giant clouds of krill that lived on the edges of ice sheets during the Ice Ages. But why certain ichthyosaur species would grow to such mammoth proportions remains a matter of speculation. Ichthyosaurs appeared during the start of the Triassic, some 250 million years ago. Though they initially lived along coasts, they eventually moved to deeper water. At their height, they filled many niches, from ambush predator to suction feeder and were among the most successful animals in the oceans. But about 90 million years ago, almost 25 million years before the dinosaurs disappeared, ichthyosaurs died out. Researchers are currently trying to understand what drove the once plentiful sea reptiles to extinction."}, {"title": "Rare Tiny T. Rex Unearthed in Montana", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "April 4, 2018", "doc": "In 2016, students from the Natural History Museum at Kansas University found a relatively small dinosaur pelvis in the Hell Creek formation in Montana. It was the end of their dig season and they didnt have the time to unearth the rest of the remains. But the fossil was worth the wait when they returned last summer, they found part of a jaw, teeth and skull segment of what appears to be a 66.5 million year old juvenile T. rex, reports Laura Geggel at LiveScience. In the last 100 years of excavations, fewer than five juvenile T. rex have come out of Hell Creek, which boasts an impressive assemblage of ancient remains. And the latest find may be the best so far. This is probably the most preserved and most complete, Kyle Atkins Weltman, who is helping to prepare the fossil at KU tells Geggel. This is a 1 in 100 million specimen. While the researchers believe the fossil is of a juvenile T. rex, they arent yet one hundred percent certain. The teeth suggest its a Tyrannosaurus rex however, there is still more work to be done, David Burnham, preparator of vertebrate paleontology at the KU Biodiversity Institute, says in a press release. Because a young T. rex is so rare, there are only a few that have been found over the years, so its difficult to discern what are changes due to growth or if the differences in the bones reflect different species. The researchers are comparing the Universitys older T. rex and a previously found young T. rex\u200b they have on loan to help in the identification efforts, Burnham says. One of the biggest challenges of this analysis, however, is the transformation the creatures undergo as they age. Dinosaurs, in particular T. rex, changed quite a bit during their childhood and adolescence, making it difficult to connect the fossils of young dinosaurs to their adult counterparts.  As Geggel reports, this particular fossil appears to be younger than an 11 year old T. rex pulled out of Hell Creek but older than a 3 year old fossil. Its likely, if this is a T. rex, that it was six to eight years old at the time of its death. But the find also revives a long simmering controversy in paleontology. In 1988, eminent paleontologist Robert Bakker announced that the skull of what was believed to be a juvenile T. rex dug up in Montana decades before was actually a new type of tiny T. rex like dinosaur, dubbing it Nanotyrannus, Brian Switek reported for Smithsonian.com in 2015. In 1999, Thomas Carr, a paleontologist at Carthage College in Wisconsin, challenged that claim. After reexamining the skull, he argued that it was just a juvenile T. rex. In 2015, he and his team revisited the Nanotyrannus, comparing its features to the skull of an 11 year old T. rex pulled out of Hell Creek. Again, Carr concluded the supposed Nanotyrannus skull was just a very young T. rex. There are a few distinctive features to help link the young and old creatures. For example, young T. rex have features like a wide forehead, a narrow snout and forward facing eye sockets, Carr tells Geggel. All of these features are present in the contentious fossil. The identity of the latest fossil is still unconfirmed. And as Burnham tells Geggel, he and his colleagues are keeping an open mind. If it turns out to be Nanotyrannus, were OK with that. If it turns out to be the best small T. rex in the world, were happy with that as well, he says. The KU teams hopes to return to the same spot where they found the skull this summer to see if they can dig up more of the fossil, which is estimated to be around 17 feet long."}, {"title": "Dinosaur Horns Were For Making Love, Not War", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "March 22, 2018", "doc": "For many people, thoughts of Triceratops conjure up a massive dino sporting sweeping horns that can drive deep into the belly of its mortal enemy, Tyrannosaurus. But scientists have no real evidence the two Cretaceous beasts ever tangled. And as Mary Halton at the BBC reports, a new study adds to the evidence that the often elaborate frills and horns of Triceratops and other ceratopsians, or horned dinosaurs, were all about looking good, not preparing them for dinosaur death matches Over the years, paleontologists have struggled to understand why horned dinos developed such elaborate horns and frills. While common sense suggests that Triceratops sharp horns were defensive, it doesnt explain the ornamentation of recently discovered species like Regaliceratops peterhewsi, the Hellboy Dinosaur or Machairoceratops cronusi the Bent Sword Face dinosaur. And the number of these spike faced creatures known to exist is climbing. In fact, the number of known horned dinosaurs that roamed Asia and North America has tripled over the last 20 years from just 23 identified in 1996. The growing sample size of these dinos means researchers now have enough information to start answering big evolutionary questions, like why all these weird permutations of horns and plates developed. In a new study published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, researchers did just that, examining 350 traits of 46 ceratopsian species that evolved over a 15 million year time span. Kevin Loria at Business Insider explains that if the horns and frills werent for fightinga function ruled out in previous studiesanother possibility is that the horns diverged to help dinos distinguish one species from another. These differences could have prevented similar looking dinos of different species from accidentally mating with the wrong horny critter. If thats the case, then species that lived in close proximity to each other would have evolved at different rates than species that lived in isolation. But the analysis suggests that wasnt the case. In fact, according to a press release, these ornaments generally evolved much faster than other traits for all the creatures. Its pretty energy intensive to grow and carry around all the fancy head gear, so what best explains the fast, costly rise of these horns and frills? Good old sexual selection. Individuals are advertising their quality or genetic make up, lead author of the study, Andrew Knapp of Queen Mary University, London, tells Halton. We see that in peacocks too, with their tail feathers. That doesnt mean the sexy masks had just one purpose. Some of these ornaments were also likely used at times for defense against predators or, to some extent, for recognition of members of different species, paleobiologist Darla Zelenitsky of the University of Calgary, not involved in the study, tells Halton. But these were apparently not the primary driver in their evolution. Knapp says he hopes to do more work to confirm whether or not sexual selection is the main driver of the horns. All the basic evolutionary models predict these changes as a consequence of sexual selection, he tells the AFP, extremes are selected and those traits tend to be passed on to offspring. But things are a little different when it comes to horned dinosaurs. In many animals, the males usually develop crazy dances, distinctive colors, or impressive horns to attract females. But in ceratopsians, both sexes grew the elaborate facial coat racks, suggesting something unique happened within the group of dinosaurs. This is not the first time paleontologists have crushed our dreams of a massive dino fight club. As Brian Switek reported for Smithsonian.com in 2016, researchers came to a similar conclusion about the tank like armor and club like tails of ankylosaur dinosaurs. There is almost no evidence that they used their tails for battle. Its more likely the hardware was also used to show off genetic fitness, much like massive modern elephants do with their tusks. But dont worry, well always have T. Rex to fill our dinosaur bloodlust."}, {"title": "What\u2019s a \u201cMissing Link\u201d? ", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "March 6, 2018", "doc": "When Darwin published Origin of Species, one thing was missing from his argument a missing link.  Though the term never once appears in the book, Darwin knew that his claims could benefit greatly from paleontological evidence of a species transitionan intermediate species connecting, for instance, humans to apes and monkeys. Less than two years after the publication of Origins, he got his wish. On January 3rd, 1863, Charles Darwin received a letter from his paleontologist friend Hugh Falconer with news of a tantalizing find Archaeopteryx.  This extraordinary fossilbearing feathers as well as teeth, claws, a bony tail\u00a0and other reptilian traitswas just the sort of creature that Darwins theory of evolution by natural selection predicted should exist. The feathers left no question that the Jurassic Archaeopteryx was a bird, but the creature also had a suite of saurian traits that pointed to a reptilian ancestry.  Falconer could hardly contain his glee. Had the Solenhofen quarries been commissionedby august commandto turn out a strange being a la Darwin, he wrote his friend, it could not have executed the behest more handsomelythan in the\u00a0Arch\u00e6opteryx.  Today, some still refer to Archaeopteryx as that long sought missing link between birds and dinosaurs. It certainly checks a lot of boxes for an animal that seems between what were thought to be two distinct categories of organism. But theres good reason not to use the phrasewhich Darwin himself knew. As Nicholas Pyenson, Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History curator of fossil marine mammals, puts it\u00a0Life is really a tree, not a chain.  To me, the idea of a missing link implies a linear chain of one species evolving into another, evolving into another, and so on, says Smithsonian Human Origins Program anthropologist Briana Pobiner. That isnt the pattern we see. Instead, evolution produces a tree like branching pattern with multiple descendants of an ancestor species existing at the same time, and sometimes even alongside that ancestor species.  The chain metaphor that missing link implies would have us looking for straight lines, when the reality of evolution is much more discursive.\u00a0Not every fossil creature can be slotted in as a direct ancestor to something alive today. Thats why paleontologists have come to abhor the term it obscures the true pattern of evolutionary change.  But what to call strange beings a la Darwin\u00a0like Archaeopteryx, whales with legs, and humans that look like apes? Paleontologists often prefer the term transitional form or intermediate form, because they imply that these species are parts of an ever changing continuum.\u00a0This isnt just a matter of splitting hairs erminology shapes our ideas and the way dramatic changes in the course of life are interpreted. Before and even after\u00a0Darwin, naturalists sometimes saw species as part of a ranked hierarchy in which\u00a0newer forms were somehow better than what came before. Sloppy words lead to sloppy thinking, as Pyenson says.  In some sense, every species in a transitional form from its ancestor because it retains many ancestral traits but has enough unique traits to be a separate species, Pobiner says. And given that every species alive today has fossils related to its ancestry, thats a lot of transitional fossils. More often, Pobiner says, paleontologists often use this term when talking about larger anatomical or ecological shifts that occurred during the history of life.  Not that transitional form is without its own problems. The phrase can sometimes inadvertently cast an evolutionary cousin as an ancestor through popular translation. But it at least highlights that the organism in question helps inform what paleontologists have identified as a major shift in lifes history.  Evolution is constantly branching out, and drawing out lines of descentfrom one ancestor species to its direct descendantis almost always impossible due to the incomplete nature of the fossil record. I look at the natural geological record, Darwin wrote, as a history of the world imperfectly kept. Relating strata to pages of a book, he continued Of this volume only here and there a short chapter has been preserved and of each page, only here and there a few lines.  Paleontologists know these lines well, for of all the life that ever existed only a fraction was preserved and an even smaller portion as yet found. Whats truly\u00a0amazing, then, is that we are able to detect major changes at all We know much of the remarkable evolutionary story of whales\u00a0thanks to\u00a0transitional fossils. The very first whales, for instance, didnt look anything like the minkes and orcas swimming around todays oceans. About 55 million years ago, they were terrestrial animals with hooved feet that looked something like small deer with long tails. They were artiodactyls, members of the same group of mammals that includes hippos and cows today.  Over the course of about 10 million years, early whales at the waters edge became increasingly amphibious until only the totally aquatic forms were left. This required major changes to how whales moved, what they ate\u00a0and their senses. A growing accumulation of fossils since the 1970s inform how these changes unfolded at the same time, you can see whales past forms in telltale signs like the handbones in a blue whales fin.  An entire flotilla of early whale fossils\u00a0outlines these changes, such as feet that became paddle like, spines adapted to up and down undulation to swim, and teeth suited to nabbing slippery fish. Whales dont look anything like their nearest relatives alive today, says Pyenson, who is the author of the upcoming book\u00a0Spying on Whales The Past, Present, And Future of Earths Most Awesome Creatures. Fossils are what tells us about these connections.  This is why the fossil record is so essential. If we only had DNA to go on and no fossil record, Pyenson says, wed still be scratching our head as to where whales came from.\u00a0 Whales arent unique, of course. Transcendent evolutionary change applies to every organism, from redwoods to whales, from dinosaurs to sea slugsto us. In fact, we are\u00a0one of the core problems with the phrase missing link.  Many people associate the phrase distinctly with humans. For them, it conjures up\u00a0the image of a beetle browed, half human, half ape creature that would slot right in between us and chimpanzees. But, as we know, evolution doesnt proceed along a linear path\u00a0that would spit out such a being\u00a0we have a family tree, not a family ladder. Instead of a single fossil that answers all our questions, what we have is a varied group of fossil humans who help us understand that we are just\u00a0part of a much larger tale. Theres also a political reason experts have often avoided using the term. Anti evolution organizations like Answers in Genesis and the Discovery Institute have often claimed that missing links are exactly that\u00a0missing. For every new facet of evolution a particular organism might show us, there is an evolution denier pointing to what has not yet been found as if its disproof.\u00a0Relying on the term missing link,\u00a0in other words, gives to much advantage to anti science agitators, giving scientists all the more reason to abandon the term. In reality, the human story stretches back millions of years, leaving us the last species standingliterally. We habitually walk in a way that no other animal does with our backs totally upright and our legs beneath us.\u00a0How that happened has been a major research focus as paleontologists and anthropologists have looked to our past. This change occurred relatively early on, between the time our ancestors split from chimpanzee ancestors over 6 million years ago and about 3.6 million years ago when prehistoric people walked through ash and gave us definitive proof that early humans were walking much like we do. But the story of humanity goes beyond the legs and spine.\u00a0The earliest hominins also had relatively smaller canines than other apes do, Pobiner says, one of many changes related to alterations in diet, behavior, and more.  Weve been able to piece together many of these changes thanks to transitional fossils.\u00a0Without a modified DeLorean or TARDIS, though, we are left with the imperfect, incomplete, and nonetheless illuminating fossil record an epic story of life in transition."}, {"title": "The Woman Who Shaped the Study of Fossil Brains", "author": "Leila McNeill", "date": "March 1, 2018", "doc": "Tilly Edinger was one of those rare people who knew exactly what she wanted to do. After reading Othenio Abels Principles of Vertebrate Paleontology, she had her calling the study of ancient animals through their bones. She would go on to become one of the most significant paleontologists of the 20th century, and the first woman to be elected president of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. Not only that, but she would found an entirely new field of inquirypaleoneurology, or the study of fossil brains.  Edinger once called the discovery of a petrified, brain shaped lump of mud inside the cracked skull of a pterodactyl the opening theme of the overture of paleoneurology. Yet if this was the opening theme of paleoneurology, Edingers was the bridge that connected its disparate parts. By uncovering hidden connections no one else had seen, Edinger was able to piece together a budding discipline.  Edinger was born and raised in the city of Frankfurt am Main in 1897, to wealthy and well known Jewish parents social activist Anna Goldschmidt and prominent comparative neurologist Ludwig Edinger, founder of the Neurological Institute at the Goethe Institute and the first Chair of Neurology at the University of Frankfurt. The young Edinger received a high quality education, first at home at the hands of a governess and then at the only girls school in Frankfurt, the Schiller Schule.  But after high school, it was expected that Edinger would marry rather than follow a profession. Her mother would continue to refer to Edingers work as a hobby, even after it was clear that Edinger was going to pursue a career in science when she embarked on her doctoral studies.  Despite social convention, Edinger went on to study at the University of Heidelberg and Munich and later earn a doctoral degree in geology, zoology and psychology from Frankfurt University in 1921. For her dissertation research, Edinger studied an endocast of the Triassic marine reptile Nothosaurus, kicking off her life long investigation into fossilized brains.  Soon after graduation, Edinger took on unpaid assistant positions at both the Geological Institute of Frankfurt University and the Senckenberg Museum of Natural history, which gave her access to vast collections of vertebrate fossils. She would be named Curator of Fossil Vertebrates at the Senckenberg in 1926. Around 1923, in a letter to Dutch anatomist C. U. Ari\u00ebns Kappers, Edinger writes I have noticed that a large literature exists about fossil brains, distributed widely in all the journals of the earth, and I have given myself the assignment not only to collect but also to rework this material into a book, Paleoneurology.  In 1929, Edinger published her nearly decade long research project, Die fossilen Gehirne or Fossil Brains. She had the biology and the geology background to start putting these specimens into a beginning context, says paleontologist Emily Buchholtz, who has authored several profiles of Edingers life and scientific work with co author Ernst August Seyfarth. In her book, Edinger examined 280 papers that dealt with the brains and spinal cords of extinct vertebrates separately, but had not yet been looked at in relation to each other. Her achievement was to synthesize this work through the framework of two seemingly disparate fields geology and neurology.  Before her, paleoneurology was largely descriptive, based on the random collection and characterization of specimens. In her examination of a centurys worth of research, Edigner saw connections that no one else had noticed. She used these observations to establish, an idea that shaped the burgeoning field. As Buchholtz writes, Edinger had transformed paleoneurology into a discipline that was taxonomically, chronologically, and functionally informed.  A year after the publication of Fossil Brains, the Nazi Party gained unprecedented power and became the second largest political party in Germany. By 1933, Adolf Hitler was named Chancellor. Hitler swiftly began passing oppressive legislation against Jewish people, starting with the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service Act. This act kept Jews and other so called non Aryans as well as political opponents from holding jobs in government institutions.  Since the Senckenberg was a private institution, Edinger was able to retain her position as curator. But this did not wholly shield her from the threat of Nazi violence, which shaped her daily life and work. For five more years, she would strive to make herself as invisible as possible by entering through the side door of the museum, removing her name plate from her door, and staying out of sight. She faced another challenge, too. Since her teen years, Edinger had slowly been going deaf from otosclerosis, a disease of the inner ear. Though her disability did not typically hinder her work, she was forced to stop attending professional meetings, which required her sit in the front of the room to hear the speaker. This drew unwanted attention Jewish people with disabilities, like Edinger, were at an even higher risk of violence and sometimes sterilization under the 1933 Law for the Prevention of Progeny with Hereditary Diseases.  Yet despite the urging of her colleagues and friends, Edinger refused to leave Frankfurt. When Harvard physician and family friend of the Edingers Alice Hamilton visited in 1938, she recalled Edinger saying, ... Frankfurt is my home, my mothers family has been here since 1560, I was born in this house. And I promise you they will never get me into a concentration camp. I always carry with me a fatal dose of veronal.  On November 9, her resolve shifted. That nightwhich came to be called Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glassmarked a frenzy of destruction in which Nazis systematically burned synagogues, destroyed Jewish businesses, homes, and institutions, and murdered and imprisoned Jewish people across the Reich. Edinger was left with little choice but to seek her escape.  Even with the knowledge of the heightening Nazi brutality, the U.S. continued to comply with the Immigration Act of 1924, which limited immigration to 150,000 immigrants per year. Edinger was given quota number 13,814. The Act allowed foreign ministers and professors to bypass the quota if they could find work in an American institutions, so Edingers colleagues in Europe and the U.S. rushed to help her secure a position. George Gaylord Simpson wrote to the American consulate praising Edinger as a research scientist of the first rank  She is so preeminent in this field that she may really be said to have created a new branch of science, that of paleo neurology.  Still, Edinger was not approved. As she awaited her quota number to be called, the Emergency Association of German Scientists Abroad helped her obtain passage out of Germany to London. Having lost nearly all of her familys estate in the Holocaust, she took with her only two German marks and a set of cutlery. Finally, in 1940, Edingers number was called, and she was able to find work as a research associate at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology MCZ with the help of Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Scholars. She was one of the only four women scientists granted aid by the Committee. One way or another, the fossil vertebrates will save me, Edinger had\u00a0written, in an eerily prescient letter to a colleague in 1938. She was right\u00a0That book did in fact save her life, Buchholtz says, referring to Fossil Brains.  This is little exaggeration. Back in Germany, Edingers brother, Fritz, died in a concentration camp. The Nazis removed the street sign, Edingerstrasse, named after Ludwig, along with a bust of her mother, Anna, from a city park. With not much left in her home country, Edinger had decided to stay in the U.S. after she received news that her aunt had died in 1943. My last tie with anybody in Germany ended  when I was informed  that my fathers sister in Berlin, the woman I loved best in the world committed suicide when she was deported, Endinger wrote in a letter to paleontologist Sir Arthur Smith. She made it to Boston, and became a citizen in 1945.  At the MCZ, Edinger returned to her work in paleoneurology, turning her attention now to the horse brain. When Edinger began this particular study, many understood the evolution of the brain within one timeframe. Edinger, however, charted the horse brain over different geological time periods, finding that brain enlargement and folds on the surface of brain arose independently from and in parallel to different mammals. Buchholtz says that what Edinger was able to do, was to actually know where in the fossil record these different shapes of brain of one particular species occurred. In 1948 Edinger published the culmination of this research in her second monograph, Evolution of the Horse Brain.  On May 26, 1967, Edinger was struck by a truck while crossing the street, an accident widely attributed toher hearing loss. She died at Cambridge City Hospital the next day. Up until her sudden death, even after her 1964 retirement from the MCZ, Edinger continued her own research and remained active in the paleontology community.  Although her career was punctuated by many traumas and upheavals, Edinger published nearly 100 articles and books. Moreover, in laying the groundwork for modern paleoneurology, she expanded the possibilities of how fossilized brains could inform our understanding of an evolutionary past. After her death, colleagues completed her unfinished project of 20 years, an annotated bibliography of paleoneurology that chronicled the field from its beginning in 1804 to 1966. It still serves as an entry point into the discipline."}, {"title": "Rare Mammoth Tracks Reveal an Intimate Portrait of Herd Life", "author": "Maya Wei-Haas", "date": "February 26, 2018", "doc": "The dinner plate sized impressions\u00a0were barely discernible. When he first spotted them in the dust of the dry lakebed, paleontologist Gregory J. Retallack and his students didnt think much. But upon closer inspection, what looked like four or five prints partially covered in sand turned out to be a winding section of 117 tracks. These tracks, they would later learn, were left 43,000 years ago by six Columbian mammoths four adults, a youngster and an infant on a curious journey. This was a big deala mammoth one, you might say. Aside from studying living elephants, most of what we know about mammoths\u00a0from physical characteristics to diet, comes from their skeletal remains.\u00a0Yet social behavior is more challenging to tease out, and ancient trackways are one of the few windows in. These prints had captured an intimate moment between an injured adult female and concerned young, offering an unprecedented peek into the world of mammoth herd life. The group came upon the tracks in April 2014, during the annual fossil hunting trip Retallack organizes for his students at the University of Oregon. They had already found fossils at several sites when he decided to swing by Fossil Lake. This dry, barren lakebed is known for its fossil riches the remains of creatures up to\u00a0646 thousand years\u00a0linger in its dusty layers, including birds, fish, mollusk and even mammals like camels, ground sloths and mammoths.  Retallack, the director of paleontological collections at University of Oregons Museum of Natural and Cultural History, had just instructed the class to spread out and begin their search when he spotted the circular marks. Those look like mammoth tracks to me, Retallack recalls telling the students standing nearby. The students werent so impressed. I dont think they even believed me, he says now. But the tracks stuck in his mind. Three years later, Retallack obtained the funding to return with a team of researchers from the university, the Bureau of Land Management, and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette to unearth and analyze the prints. They dusted away the sand and, using both ground based and drone mounted cameras, took detailed images of the area. By compiling these images, the team created a three dimensional digital model to tease out the elephant vignette recorded in mud. The researchers also dug a pit nearby to study the sediment layers, publishing their findings earlier this month in the journal Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. Their analysis suggests that the creatures were Columbian mammoths, a species that tromped from Canada to modern Nicaragua starting nearly a million years ago. Standing slightly taller than modern African elephants, the creatures had massive tusks up to 16 feet long. Unlike their wooly cousins, Columbian mammoths are thought to have sported a much more sparse coat of furperhaps even only having a mop top of coarse hair on their heads. They are believed to have gone extinct some 10,000 years ago, though the exact cause of their demise remains a mystery. The main trackway at the site extends for 65 feet. But theres something strange about it\u00a0Unlike other known ancient mammoth trails, the footprints are closely spaced and the right side is much deeper than the left the left rear foot tracks are particularly faint. We know a lot about elephant tracks. We have a lot of them going back in the fossil record going back 16 million years or more, Retallack says. Mostly the elephants are striding out like a sergeant major in a parade. Not these pachyderms. The\u00a0unusual footprints, the researchers believe, are due to an injury in the animals left rear leg that caused the animal to move slowly and limp, in an effort to ease the pain. Thats an impressive amount of information to draw\u00a0from one set of tracks. But Lisa Buckley, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Peace Region Palaeontology Research Centre in northeast British Columbia who specializes in interpreting ancient animal tracks, agrees. The consistency of the surface around the footprints, she says, suggests that the unusual spacing and differences in depth were from the track makers hobbled stride, rather than variation in the mud itself. Crisscrossing the site are smaller trackwaysroughly the size of a bowling ball or smallerthat appear to be made by two young creatures a juvenile mammoth between one and three years old, and a baby less than a year old. The tracks suggest that these youngsters were running ahead of the group, likely eager to get to the lake, which lay about a mile to the west of the slow moving mammoth parade, says Retallack. During their march, the tracks repeatedly return to the limping mammoth, as if the young were checking on the progress of their slow moving companion. Upon each return, there were little deflections where those trackways met, says Retallack. These hint that the injured creature was interacting with the young, much like the tender interactions that have been observed for African elephants, their modern relatives. As Buckley says, its very plausible that the young animals were coming up and going, Oh hey, how are you doing? Those kind of interactions in turn suggest that the injured adult was a female, says Retallack. As he explains, mammoth herds, like modern elephants, are thought to have moved in matriarchal groups, led by an older female. Once the males reach the age of somewhere between 10 and 15 they get kicked out of the herd, says Advait Jukar, vertebrate paleontologist with Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the latest study. They form these bachelor groups and they go off and do their own thing. One striking mammoth track site that shows these herding behaviors can be found in the United Arab Emirates, says Jukar. The site records trackways of a herd of at least 13 ancient elephant relatives thought to be gathered in a matriarchal herd, with one lone male blazing a trail of large round tracks that cut across the herds path. If the lead elephant at the Fossil Lake site was male, it would be too young to have sired any babies, Retallack explains, and would likely be indifferent to the little honkers gambling about. We of course cant be 100 percent sure, because all were dealing with is the trackway, Jukar says of the new study. But its a reasonable hypothesis to make. The chances of finding a collection of tracks like this are\u00a0exceedingly rare, and rely\u00a0on the rapid preservation of\u00a0footprints before wind or rain can obscure the impressions. Even when that does happen, most tracks merely record what animals do for most of the day Walking from point A to point B, usually in a straight line, says Buckley. Its so uncommon to get these other types of behaviors in footprints that we often make the jokes that dinosaurs couldnt turn. We find so many straight trackways. The Fossil Lake tracks mark a fortuitous coincidence of weather, geology and a mammoth herd passing by. The footprints are etched into sediments rich with volcanic ash, likely remnants of an explosion from Mount Saint Helens in present day Washington 43 thousand years ago. The ash blanketed the region, turning what was once a grassland into a more barren, muddy expansea surface ripe for trackways. Between the wind, ash and sediment from streams, the mammoth tracks were likely quickly covered. Over tens of thousands of years, the teams soil analysis suggests, the region transitioned back to grassland and then again to the more barren landscape present today. The last transition may be due, in part, to the extinction of mammoths and other big grazers, Retallack explains, which supplied nutrients in their dung and kept the grasses healthy by\u00a0trampling and munching on it. The Fossil Lake mammoth prints, it seems, are just one chapter in the larger story of dramatic ecosystem level changes. Its a lot from a single trackway, isnt it? marvels Retallack. I was kind of surprised myself."}, {"title": "What Shrinking Fossil-Rich National Monuments Means for Science", "author": "Maya Wei-Haas", "date": "December 18, 2017", "doc": "Earlier this month, President Donald Trump announced the dramatic rollback of protections for roughly two million acres of land in national monuments of southern Utah, stating that the creation of these parks locks up hundreds of millions of acres of land and water under strict government control. Speaking from the states capitol in Salt Lake City, Trump then signed two proclamations. One slashed the 1.35 million acres that comprise Bears Ears National Monument by 85 percent, while another cut the 1.9 million acre Grand Staircase Escalante national monument nearly in half.  The move was met with immediate pushback from Native American groups, wildlife conservation organizations, and even the outdoor supplier Patagonia, many of whom announced their intentions to file lawsuits. Yet joining this flurry of suits was one organization that many may not have expected the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology SVP, a scientific organization that comprises more than 2,300 members from universities and scientific institutions around the world. What was a society that describes itself as organized exclusively for educational and scientific purposes doing suing the federal government? Both Bears Ears and Grand Staircase were createdat least in parton the grounds of paleontological importance. In just the last decade, researchers in Grand Staircase have found and described more than 25 new taxa that were totally new to scienceincluding Utahceratops and Kosmoceratops, the unusual relatives of the frill faced Triceratops. Grand Staircase especially is jaw droppingly important in vertebrate paleontology, says David Polly, paleontologist at Indiana University Bloomington and president of SVP. Its completely transformed the way we think about not only the Late Cretaceous but other parts of the Mesozoic. Though Bears Ears is a newer monument, created in 2016 by then President Barack Obama, its already proving to have great scientific potential. Earlier this year researchers announced the discovery of Utahs only known Pravusuchus hortus, an ancient crocodile like marine reptile, within its bounds. The monument captures an incredible record of dinosaurs transitioning from wimpy little nothing components of the ecosystems to being these huge, world beating mega important parts of the global ecosystem, says Robert Gay, a vertebrate paleontologist who conducts research in association with the Museums of Western Colorado. Countless more finds surely reside within both monuments original bounds. But researchers fear that without the current federal protections, they may be in danger of disappearing. These things have been lying in the ground for 75 million years, and there arent anymore being created. If we lose the resource, its gone foreverperiod. Its gone, says Robin OKeefe, a paleontologist at Marshall University who conducts research in Grand Staircase. We can get coal other places we cant get these fossils anywhere else. Smithsonian.com spoke with five scientists about how loss of this strict government control could harm not only conservation and paleontology researchbut the nations history and legacy itself. How Monument Status Protects Landscapes The idea of designating sites as national monuments dates back to the 1906 Antiquities Act, which empowered the president to protect these sites for public use. Today, national monument status comes with far more than a pretty plaque It both helps beef up protections against fossil looting and prioritizes scientific activities. The new proclamations would convert vast swaths of land to Federal multi use land, bringing the potential for natural resource extractionincluding oil and gasand other activities that could impact the ancient relics still hidden within the sweeping landscape. The importance of making these sites accessible to scientists goes beyond the work of a few people conducting research in the site, says Andrew Farke, a paleontologist with the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology. I think a lot of times, its pitted as scientists versus everyone else, or extreme conservationists versus everyone else, he says. When you have a loss of protection for fossils, its not just a loss for science. Its a loss for all Americans. This is part of our countrys story this is part of our planets story. Bears Ears and Grand Staircase were both, at least in part, created in recognition of their potential to help researchers better understand the geologic past. That means that currently, scientists are given priority in the monument bounds. This is far from the case on general public land, explains OKeefe. Land managed by the federal Bureau of Land Management is technically available for all to usebut when natural resource extraction companies secure a permit for a particular site, the fences go up, the roads go in and we the scientists no longer really have access, says OKeefe.  Even if he secures the necessary permits, he adds, its no guarantee that he will be able to gain access. He recounts several times that he was threatened by ranchers whose cattle were grazing in the region of interest. We can go out there, but I dont want to take my life in my hands to do my job, says Okeefe. In most cases, monuments also have the funding for more staff members, including park rangers and even on site scientists. This means more eyes on the ground to prevent looting by private collectors and fossil hunterswhich exist and are rapacious, says OKeefe. One of the primary motivating factors for the creation of Bears Ears was the rallying of five Native American groupswho are all now part of a lawsuit for returned protectionsto prevent the pillaging of the regions vast cultural and archaeological sites. That concern also extends to scientifically valuable fossils. The first ever discovery of Pravusuchus in Utah was by a looter, says Gay, who has done extensive work in the region of Bears Ears. The looter, a past volunteer at a southwestern Natural History Museum, found and removed the skull of the crocodile esque creature sometime in the 1990s, which prevented scientists from ID ing the specimen. In 2008, the individual decided to return the skull, which allowed for the first documentation of these creatures in Utah, presented this year at SVPs annual meeting. But its likely not all similar stories have such a happy end. As Gay says Who knows what sort of sites like this looted site are still out there? Monument status also establishes additional funding streams to support and promote scientific research within its boundaries, everything from surveying to logistical support like helicopter lifts. Gay can attest to the impacts of this funding. He worked in an area within Bears Ears before it gained monument status. Almost as soon as the monument was proclaimed, I was informed that there was money available to help the BLM better understand and manage the resources there, he says. Within a few months, he applied and received a grant of 25,000 to work at Bears Ears. At Grand Staircase, the funding also supports an on site paleontologist, who is the force behind surveying the landscape and reaching out to specialists to establish collaborations and deeper research. Having that person in place there for the monument lands, means that things happen much more smoothly, much more quickly, says Farke. You have someone thats really overseeing just that little parcel of field work, versus having to oversee all of the federal lands in Utah. Protections Lost Utahs national monuments consist of an impressive array of featurespostcard perfect vistas, precipitous cliffs and winding canyons, all highlighted by brilliant red rocks. And each monument is home to its own unique collection of valuable artifacts and natural wonders. Under the newly proposed boundaries, however, at least 400 paleontological sites in Grand Staircase alone now fall outside the monument, Polly tells Smithsonian.com. And theres almost certainly more, he adds, explaining that exact localities must remain confidential to prevent looting.  In collaboration with the Grand Staircase Escalante Partners and Conservation Lands Foundations, SVP has filed a lawsuit in pursuit of returned protections to Grand Staircase. In a second lawsuit, SVP collaborated with Native American, archaeological, conservation and historic preservation organizations to restore protections to Bears Ears. Not only do we believe that key paleo resources will be endangered when they are removed from the monuments boundaries, but we believe that the President lacks the legal authority to reduce those boundaries, according to an SVP statement on the lawsuit. This argument echos other recent suits filed against the move While the Antiquities Act empowers the president to create national monuments, it does not specifically state that he or she can reduce their borders. Instead, it included the vague requirement that monuments must be limited to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected. The reduction is potentially damaging to the scientific process, says Polly. In order for the science to advance, he explains, researchers must be able to return to collection sites to not only verify the research that came before, but add to these interpretations as technology, and therefore analytic capacity, improves.  We want science to be replicable we want it to be verifiable, says Polly. But under the newly proposed boundaries, the countless research sites that now lay outside of the monuments boundsand the multitude of areas that are yet to be studiedface an uncertain future. Not All is Lost Lands that fall outside the monument bounds arent left completely unprotected. These fall under regulation by the 2009 Paleontological Resources Preservation Act, which make it illegal for casual collectors to excavate or remove vertebrate fossils. On these lands, the general public are allowed to collect small amounts of plant and invertebrate fossils, says Polly. And all scientific research requires a permit and an statement of a public repository of which Smithsonian Natural History Museum is one where the fossils will be held.  The Paleontology Act does not, however, give scientists a priority on the land. To see a stark example of what this means, one has only to look just outside the original boundaries of Bears Ears, where there was once a rich Jurassic dinosaur site\u00a0undergoing a decades long excavation by the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History. But right around the time that the monument was raised, the dinosaur quarry was leased to an oil company.\u00a0Now this oil company has this ability to drill right through one of the most important Jurassic sites in southern Utah, says Gay. Gay adds that none of the new sites he and his team have surveyed since Bears Ears was established lie within the new boundaries. In particular, hes concerned about a fossil packed area that lies within the White Canyon, which Gay characterizes as probably the most important Triassic site in the state of Utah. Not only did the region yield the prized Pravusuchus, but he believes that there are at least three new species within these beds. Another Bears Ears site no longer under monument protections, says Gay, is an area packed with fossilized life, sharks, fish, amphibians and transitional creaturesnot quite mammals and not quite reptiles, as Gay describesknown as Valley of the Gods. The region, which Obama mentioned in his 2016 proclamation for its fossilized tetrapod trackways, offers a window into the many players, and their interactions, as they struggle to survive. Its not just an isolated skeleton or isolated footprint, he says. You get a whole idea of what is going on. Hes concerned that the loss of protections for these sites could allow for the mining of uranium, which is abundant in the region. Similarly, the sites excluded from the new Grand Staircase boundaries have much to offer. In particular, Polly and OKeefe both mention the Tropic Shalea 75 million year old formation of marine sands and mud. The sediments were laid during a period when the Earth was much warmer than it is today. No ice caps existed to lock away the water and because of that, North America was split by a warm shallow sea that blanked the middle of the continent. It was almost like a hot tub for marine reptiles, says OKeefe. Fed by a constant stream of nutrients, the ocean supported all walks of life, from snails and ammonites to the massive Mosasaurus, an extinct group of marine reptiles. In fact, he says, some of the very first Mosasaurs known were found in this region, which is critical to understanding the early evolution of these creatures. The site also houses the last known examples of Liopleurodons, a behemoth of a marine predator, before the Mosasaurus took over. But there is still much more to do in the Tropic Shale. Were just starting to explore and excavate, he says. We need a coherent program and we need years of work to find the stuff and get it excavated. One of OKeefes biggest concerns in this region is the mining of bentonite claysa common ingredient of cat litter and drilling mud. Bentonite is abundant in the region and if miners come in and take the clays, everything is going to be gone. he says. Thats the kind of thing that keeps me up a night. Of course, there are also still some scientifically significant regions that remain in the protected Grand Staircase landscape. Importantly the Kaiparowits Formation, which has yielded many important finds, including the previously mentioned\u00a0Utahceratops\u00a0and\u00a0Kosmoceratops. Protections of this region are particularly important as it sits atop some 62 billion tons of coal, around 11.3 billion tons accessible for mining,\u00a0according to USGS estimates. The area that still lies within the parks boundaries has certainly been the most productive area for reconstructing Cretaceous ecosystems, says\u00a0Lindsay Zanno, paleontologist and division head of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Zanno worked in the Kaiparowits while getting her graduate degree from the University of Utah, describing several new species including the raptor\u00a0Talos sampsoni.\u00a0 The problem, she says, is that a lot of areas that are losing protection are much less studied, and I think going forward those would have been the areas where most paleontologists would have concentrated. The evolutionary clues hidden in these fossil assemblages hold much greater information than details about an obscure extinct species. They help scientists understand ecosystem level processes, says OKeefe. And that knowledge can help modern conservation efforts in our rapidly changing environmenta process happening in part because of the very oil and gas extraction that the presidents move could open up in these two fossil rich regions. Humans need to make a choice what the world will look like, says OKeefe. And the more we inform that choice with whats happened in the past, the more successful well be in managing impact and mitigating the worst effects of what were doing.\u200b"}, {"title": "The Ten Best Children\u2019s Books of 2017", "author": "Megan Gambino", "date": "December 18, 2017", "doc": "When illustrator and childrens book author Oliver Jeffers became a father, the Australian born, Belfast raised, Brooklyn transplant felt the immediate need to explain the world to his son.

The Rhode Island School of Design grad and partner in the company ALSO reached out, through friends and family, to seven children around the world, ages 7 to 11. He asked them to provide photos and information about their typical day, from what they eat at breakfast to how they get to school, their chores, and where they sleep at night. From what he gathered, Lamothe wrote and illustrated This Is How We Do It, a side by side comparison of the kids experiences. Simply put, in his authors note, he writes, I believe the more you learn about different people, the more you see yourself in them, and the more accepting you become.

It was here in this bright, cobalt colored home that Kahlo painted, in the company of oodles of petsdogs, a cat, monkeys, an eagle, turkeys, a fawn and a parrot named Bonito. Brown, a professor of Latino and multicultural literature at Northern Arizona University, recognizes kids interest in fuzzy and feathered animals, and leads with them, describing Kahlo in relation to her animalitos. Like her parrot, Frida was colorful, Brown writes. Like her fawn, Frida had watchful, beautiful eyes. Publishers Weekly notes, Even if readers dont get much of a sense of the work Kahlo created, theyll finish the book feeling like they know the artist.

There was already a lot of anti immigrant rhetoric floating around then, and the Statue of Libertys position of action and welcomestriding into the sea to meet new arrivalsstruck me as crucial to remember, he told the San Francisco Chronicle earlier this year. In Her Right Foot, the writer begins with the familiar story of the French gifting Lady Liberty to America, doling out factslike how she was packed up in 214 crates and shipped to New York City, and how the seven spikes on her crown symbolize the seven continents and seasthat will get kids minds swirling. Then, he draws attention to her foot. She is going somewhere She is on the move Eggers writes. And, at a critical time, he explains why this detail is so important. Liberty and freedom from oppression are not things you get or grant by standing around, he adds. These are things that require action. Courage. An unwillingness to rest.

Now, another mind blowing\u00a0amber find has surfaced, containing\u00a0a 99 million year old dinosaur feather along with several ticks, the oldest found so far. One tick still clings to a dino feather, engorged from its last blood meal,\u00a0reports John Pickrell at National Geographic. Before you get too excited, abandon any Jurassic Park fantasies now. Extracting DNA from amber has never been successful, and the short lifespan of DNA would make it too degraded to use anyway, notes\u00a0a press release.\u00a0But the new find, chronicled in the journal Nature Communications, does tell us a lot about the history and evolution of blood sucking ticks. David Grimaldi, paper co author and American Museum of Natural History entomologist, was examining a group\u00a0of amber specimens from a private collection when he and his colleagues realized they were looking at a\u00a0feather and ticks, reports\u00a0Nicholas St. Fleur at\u00a0The New York Times. Holy moly this is cool, Grimaldi tells St. Fleur he thought at the time. This is the first time weve been able to find ticks directly associated with the dinosaur feathers. The researchers found five ticks stuck in the amber. these include a nymph or immature tick, the engorged tick, and two covered with beetle hair. As\u00a0Gretchen Vogel at Science reports, the larvae of these beetles live in nests and feed off of discarded bits of skin and feathers. They are covered in protective hairs that slough off, sometimes creating mats of the hairs in nests. These tiny hairs tend to stick to anything else that visits the nest. So the presence of the larvae hair suggests that\u00a0the ticks were infesting a dinosaur nest, possibly a brood of theropod\u200b dinosthe deep ancestors of modern birds. As Pickrell reports, this find indicates two important things. First, it gives strong\u00a0evidence to suggest that dinosaurs raised their young in nests. Second, it suggests\u00a0that dinosaurs of the Cretaceous age had to deal with parasites like ticks as well. Seeing a tick preserved in the same resin flow as a feather provides a concrete example of the ecological relationship, where most of the previous evidence has been speculative, Ryan McKellar, curator of invertebrate paleontology at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Canada, who is not involved in the study, tells Pickrell. Ricardo P\u00e9rez de la Fuente, co author of the study and researcher at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, had long been pursuing the idea that ticks were dino parasites, Rebecca\u00a0Hersher\u00a0at NPR\u00a0reports. P\u00e9rez de la\u00a0Fuente has previously examined ancient ticks from other bits of amber covered in beetle hairs. But the combo of the tick and feather is the first hard evidence placing the two critters in close proximity. Even so, most researchers believed that ticks only sucked the blood of early amphibiansand many millions of years later mammalsnot feathered\u00a0dinos, paleontologist Ben Mans, who is not associated with the study, tells Hersher. This makes this most recent find a surprise.\u00a0 One of those preserved ticks also represents a new species, which the researchers dubbed\u00a0Deinocroton draculi. The scientists hope to follow up and figure out how the ancient tick fits into the family tree of the bloodsuckers. As\u00a0Pickrell reports,\u00a0 molecular clock analysis of modern ticks suggests that their ancient relatives first evolved some 200 to 300 million years ago, which means\u00a0theres still a long, bloody history of the critters for researchers to dig up."}, {"title": "New Species of Extinct Marsupial Lion Deepens Their Fierce Family Tree", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "December 11, 2017", "doc": "Most modern marsupials are pretty cute and cuddlykoalas, kangaroos, wallabies, wombats, sugar gliders and even some types of possums are pretty sweet. But the ancient marsupial lions are far from adorable furballs. And as\u00a0Elaina Zachos\u00a0reports for National Geographic, the newest member of the group adds even more diversity to their already fierce ranks. Researchers analyzed the skull, teeth, and an upper arm bone\u00a0of Wakaleo\u00a0schouteni, concluding the creature lived around 18 to 26 million years ago. Though some of the marsupial lions were as small as squirrels, surprisingly the newest species likely grew to be\u00a0dog sized. The identification of these new species has brought to light a level of marsupial lion diversity that was quite unexpected and suggest even deeper origins for the family, Gillespie says in a\u00a0press release. The remains were actually discovered in the 1980s by a volunteer\u00a0in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in Queensland, Australia. But it took over two decades of work to finally recognize the bones as a new species, reports\u00a0Calla\u00a0Wahlquist\u00a0reports for\u00a0The Guardian. Anna Gillespie, paleontologist at the University of New South Wales, began studying the creatures remains in the 1990s while working on\u00a0her PhD. And after careful careful study and comparison to other fragments, she finally concluded that it was a new species. She and her colleagues detail the find in a study published this week\u00a0in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. What is a marsupial lion? As Gillespie writes at The Conversation,\u00a0the creature is not really a lion, but a thylacoleonidaea group of marsupials that existed in Australia between 24 million and 30,000 years ago.\u00a0 Paleontologists originally called them lions because of their status as top predators, sporting\u00a0a pair of blade like teeth. These were particular impressive in Thylacoleo carnifex, the last of the marsupial lions and Australias largest ever predator. In the beginning, they were thought to be tree dwelling omnivores, but over time they got heavier and took on larger prey, growing to the size of dogs for the later species. But the newest branch to the family tree overturns this idea. Dating suggests that the new\u00a0species existed during the same time as a squirrel sized lion, Microleo attenboroughi, identified last year, which means that the marsupial lion family tree is much more complicated than researchers once thought. They would have been around at the same time. Theyre actually known from the same particular fossil site, Christine Janis, a paleontologist not involved in the research tells Zachos. They would have been very different in size and so would have been different kinds of predators.  Scratch marks found in a cave last year\u00a0showed even the larger species to evolve likely retained the climbing skill of the smaller ones, and researchers believe that they didnt chase down their prey but dropped onto them from the trees.\u00a0As Gillespie tells Wahlquist, the arms of\u00a0Wakaleo schouteni\u00a0are not complete enough to directly deduce its habitat, but fossils discovered near it suggest that\u00a0it too spent a lot of time in the trees, stalking its prey from tree to tree."}, {"title": "Gaze Into a 530-Million-Year-Old Eye, the Oldest Yet Discovered ", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "December 11, 2017", "doc": "Researchers studying a well preserved trilobite fossil believe they have found evidence for the earliest eye yet discovered,\u00a0reports the BBC. The 530 million year old fossil from Estonia shows that simple\u00a0compound eyes have not changed much in half a billion years. This particular trilobite fossil, a species called Schmidtiellus reetae, was exceptionally well preservedeyes and all. A small portion of its eye was worn away, exposing the cellular structure of the organ, which allowed researchers to examine the eye in detail. The tiny organ contains 100 ommatidia, or\u00a0subunits that make up compound eyes found today in many insects, surrounding a light sensing structure called a rhabdom. The structure is very similar to compound eyes found in modern dragonflies and bees, but the ommatidia are spaced farther apart and the eye lacks a lens commonly found today. Researchers detail the eye in a study published this week in\u00a0Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The research suggests that animals have been seeingor at least sensing brightnessfor a very long time. The principle of the modern compound eye most likely goes back to before the times of our first fossil records, lead author Brigitte Schoenemann of the University of Cologne says in the press release. Half a billion years ago, it was in the early stage of its development, and with our work we have succeeded in uncovering the first visible steps of this extremely successful visual principle. While its likely that primitive eyes formed in earlier species, researchers have not yet located fossils well preserved enough to support the transition. Older specimens in sediment layers below this fossil contain only traces of the original animals, which were too soft to be fossilized and have disintegrated over time, Schoenemann tells the BBC. This is not the only trilobite eye ever found. As the researchers note in the study, another trilobite species, Holmia kjerulfi,\u00a0evolved just a few million years later and had even better eyesight, approximating the modern dragonfly. So what could the trilobites actually see? With only 100 pixels of information, their vision was by no means high definition. But it was enough to recognize obstructions or obstacles and also to pick up the approach of predators. In fact, as\u00a0Signe Dean at ScienceAlert reports, the researchers believe the development of eyes was something of an arms race between prey species and an emerging class of predators. The race between predator and prey and the need to see and to be seen or not to be seen were drivers for the origin and subsequent evolution of efficient visual systems, as well as for protective shells, the researchers write in the study. Just a few million years later515 million years agoa three foot long creature called Anomalocaris ruled the seas. It sported sophisticated compound eyes that were on par or better than those of modern insects and crustaceans, seeing its way to becoming one of the first apex predators, munching on trilobites, eyes and all."}, {"title": "What Makes a Dinosaur a Dinosaur?", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "December 8, 2017", "doc": "Ask any 8 year old what a dinosaur is, and shell eagerly rattle off her favorite of the prehistoric celebrities. And by the time were adults, dinosaurs feel utterly familiar theyre the rockstars of prehistory, more famous and enduring then any Hollywood A lister. They loom large in our imagination as big, toothy, and, above all, bizarre animals that have been carving out a life for themselves on Earth for the past 235 million years. But what is a dinosaur, really?  To answer that, we need to go back in time no, not that far. Long before scientists were called scientists, people all over the world had been wondering who left all those ancient bones and footprints. At Flag Point in southern Utah, for example, Native Americans chiseled pictographs of three toed footprints, inspired by dinosaur tracks in the surrounding Jurassic rock. And even by the time the naturalist William Buckland christened Megalosaurus, the first dinosaur to be named, in 1824, early geologists were in the dark as to what these animals were like. Megalosaurus and other early finds like Iguanodon were envisioned as basically crocodiles and iguanas longer than a city bus.  Enter British paleontologist and biologist Richard Owen, a superstar of 19th century anatomy famous for his cantankerous attitude. As he kept an eye on what his contemporaries were discovering, Owen noticed something strange about some of the petrified reptiles coming out of Europes ancient rock. Many new fossil reptiles had been found in the early 19th century, Smithsonians Curator of Dinosauria Matthew Carrano says, but it wasnt clear what they were, or whether they were all related to one another. Owen set about trying to pinpoint that mysterious relationship.\u00a0  Owen concluded that Megalosaurus, Iguanodon and a third species called Hylaeosaurus were all united by skeletal similarities in the hip to the exclusion of other saurians of the same time. These features, including five fused vertebrae at a part of the hip called the sacrum, are peculiar among Reptiles, Owen wrote in his 1842 report. He argued that this was sufficient ground for establishing a distinct tribe or sub order of Saurian Reptiles, for which I would propose the name of Dinosauriathe terrible lizards.\n\nSince then, discoveries from every continent have filled museums with an increasing number of ever more unusual dinosaurs. Yet the more paleontologists find, the stranger and more wonderful these terrible lizards becomeand the harder it is to define what makes a dinosaur, a dinosaur.  First of all, dinosaurs are wonderfully diverse. Paleontologists have recognized over 1,000 distinct non avian species, from tiny, feathery insect hunters to giants that grew to be over 100 feet long and weigh over 70 tons. There were horned dinosaurs, armored dinosaurs, dome headed dinosaurs, crested dinosaurs, long necked dinosaurs, sickle clawed dinosaurs and flesh ripping dinosaurs. Most lived an entirely terrestrial existence, but some frequently waded into lakes and rivers recently scientists were flabbergasted by the first known\u00a0amphibious dinosaur, a swan like swimmer not dissimilar from a velociraptor. And one lineage flapped and fluttered its way into the air, evolving into the birds that are the only dinosaurs alive today.  These vastly different animals share some key traits They all laid and hatch from eggs, for example, and all the toothed dinosaurs constantly replaced their dental toolkit throughout their lives. But if we really want to get a handle on what makes a dinosaur a dinosaur, we need to zoom out. Picking dinosaurs out the reptile family treefrom mighty\u00a0Tyrannosaurus\u00a0to a bee hummingbirdrequires an evolutionary perspective.\u00a0Hans Dieter Sues, the Smithsonian Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology, puts it like this. Dinosauria is a group that contains the most recent common ancestor of birdslike a pigeon walking by on the sidewalkand the non avian dinosaur\u00a0Triceratops, Sues says, including all the descendants of that common ancestor.  There are some tell tale characteristics of the hind limbs that allow experts to separate dinosaurs from non dinosaurs going all the way back to the earliest species, Sues says, but the big picture view is that if you take\u00a0Triceratops\u00a0in one hand and a pigeon in the other and follow those two back to their last common ancestor, every animal that falls within that group counts as a dinosaur and shares certain traits in common. The two concepts are combined, Carrano says, dinosaurs are linked by common ancestry, which has given them through inheritance a set of unique features.  Dinosaur, then, isnt just a popular term for anything scaly and extinct. Its a scientific term with a strict meaning with a defined membership. Sometimes this creates what might feel like a paradox between the ancient and modern. All birds are dinosaurs, for example, but not all dinosaurs are birds. Given that birds are the only dinosaurs that remain, experts often specify whether theyre talking about non avian or avian dinosaurs. All the same, a penguin is just as much a terrible lizard as\u00a0Stegosaurus. Pop culture, as youve probably noticed, doesnt always play by the rules. In sets of plastic toys, paleo centric TV shows like\u00a0DinoRiders, and even the\u00a0Jurassic Park\u00a0movies, dinosaurs and non dinosaurs are often indiscriminately intermingled without much thought to the fact that the word dinosaur doesnt apply to just anything. The idea that the word dinosaur refers to any suitably reptilian creature, Sues says, is due to countless childrens books and commercial products that treat any large or bizarre extinct animal as a dinosaur.  So how can you, as an armchair or an aspiring paleontologist, know whether that so called saur on the silver screen is a real dino or a wannabe? Fortunately, there are a few giveaways. A lot of features that unite dinosaurs involve the construction of the hip and thigh regions, says Smithsonian Peter Buck fellow\u00a0Adam Pritchard, which gave dinosaurs their upright, pillar legged posture. Look at the top of the thigh bone, or the upper leg in digitally revived dinosaurs of the movies, Pritchard suggests, and see if it turns inwards to fit inside the socket of the hip.  Another challenge for the public in deciphering dinos is that geologic time can be hard to squeeze into our heads. I think its quite common in popular thinking to imagine the past as having happened more or less all at once, Carrano says, which means the further back in time we try to think the more lines get blurred. This means that non dinosaurs have often been falsely grouped in with the likes of\u00a0Stegosaurus, even though they lived millions of years apart.  The sail backed\u00a0Dimetrodon? Thats a protomammal more closely related to us than dinosaurs. The fish like ichthyosaurs that swam through the seas? They were one of many reptile lineages that adapted to life in the water during the Mesozoic. And the leathery winged pterosaurs of the air? Despite being featured in the past three\u00a0Jurassic Park\u00a0films, they were cousins of dinosaurs that split off from an earlier ancestor. Dinosaurs are their own discrete group, in other words, joined to all the rest of their family through their common ancestry and identified through the traits of their hips that have been maintained from the Triassic to the present. It might be difficult to think of an emu or quail as a terrible lizard, but youll have to take that argument up with the ghost of Richard Owen. Of course, talking about dinosaurs this way is about as exact as discussing mammals. Mammalswhich are typically defined by their tendency to grow fur, give birth to live young and make milkinclude everything from humans to hyenas, from shrews to sea whales. Mammals are composed of many branches that have moved around throughout the years, and the same was true for dinosaurs. Paleontologists have spent decades arranging and rearranging these branches, and a study earlier this year reinvigorated a debate over the shape of the dinosaur family tree. The classification of dinosaurs has undergone countless changes over the years, Sues says, with the roots of the latest exchange going back to the 19th\u00a0century.  In 1888 the British paleontologist Harry Govier Seeley argued that Owens\u00a0Dinosauria\u00a0didnt make up a natural group, but instead was a mash of what he saw as two very different groups of ancient reptiles. Seeley instead separated these two groups on the basis of their hip shape. There was the Saurischia, which he defined by its roughly lizard like kind of hip, and included the sauropod and theropod dinosaurs. And then there were the Ornithischia, which had a more bird like kind of hip, and comprised armored dinosaurs, horned dinosaurs, duckbill dinosaurs and their relatives. The irony being that we now know bird hipped dinosaurs are not closely related to birds at all. Birds are technically saurischian dinosaurs with highly modified hips.  Paleontologists ultimately combined Owens and Seeleys ideas. Today its believed that Dinosauria is a real group, anchored through shared traits to common ancestry to the exclusion of other animals. But the saurischians and ornithischians are the two main branches with more specific lineages arrayed along them. Other ideas came and went, but this vision of the dinosaur family tree stayed stable. Then, early in 2017, a study by paleontologist Matthew Baron and colleagues shook things up.  Instead of finding the traditional arrangement,\u00a0the new analysis\u00a0by Baron and colleagues came up with something different. Dinosaurs remained as a natural group, but theropod dinosaurs came out as close relatives of ornithischiansnormally positioned on the other side of the family treeand sauropod dinosaurs showed up as relatives of an enigmatic group of early carnivorous dinosaurs called herrerasaurids. The researchers decided to call the theropod ornithischian group Ornithoscelida a term coined by 19th\u00a0century naturalist Thomas Henry Huxley and kept Saurischia for the other group.  But a single new paper doesnt make a consensus. Months later, a different group of paleontologists upheld the traditional arrangement in\u00a0a rebuttal, to which followed\u00a0a rebuttal to the rebuttal. For the moment, Sues says, most dinosaur experts are not swayed by the novel hypothesis, but it does serve a useful purpose because it will stimulate more in depth analysis, especially of early dinosaurs.  If all this systematic shuffling has left you in a tizzy, dont fret. A new fossil or analysis can sow more confusion that understanding upon announcement, says Pritchard. But thats no reason to despair. This is just how science works Just as dinosaurs evolved and changed, so does the science, to incorporate new evidence and theories. Relationships are not established but must always remain hypotheses, Sues says, which stand or fall as evidence is accrued. That seems to be normal for nature, Pritchard adds. It is always much more complicated and unexpected than what scientists predict."}, {"title": "Newly Discovered Swimming Dinosaur Is Delightfully Bizarre", "author": "Mika McKinnon", "date": "December 8, 2017", "doc": "The newest fluffy dinosaur discovery is sublimely ridiculous, a mishmash of fierce claws, a graceful neck\u00a0and ungainly arms. Meet Halszkaraptor. For paleontologists, discovering the creature was likely akin to 18th century natural historians finding \u00a0platypus they were blown over in disbelief. The blend of velociraptor and duck is so bizarre scientists originally thought it was\u00a0an obvious fake. But they were delighted to find it wasnt, describing the\u00a0find this week in Nature. Even the 70 million year old fossils journey to discovery is strange. The fossil was smuggled out of Mongolia and moved around the black market fossil trade bouncing from Japan to Britain to France, reports Ed Yong for The Atlantic. Thats when Fran\u00e7ois Escuilli\u00e9 heard rumours of the unusual fossil. Escuilli\u00e9, a private fossil collector, had just rescued a collection of poached fossils and returned them to Mongolia, reports Michael Greshko for National Geographic. He took the chance that Halszkaraptor was a real creature and not a hoax, buying it and delivering it to Pascal Godefroit for assessment. Godefroit and his team originally thought the fossil was a chimera, a concoction of different fossils glued together to create an imaginary beast, Yong reports. Its toes bore curving velociraptor like claws, while its forelimbs were an odd hybrid of the usual raptor limbs and more penguin like flippers. Between its strange features and sketchy history, they suspected it was a poorly constructed fossil. But if it was real, they concluded, it must be a raptor adapted to swimmingthe first true dinosaur to join the seas with reptilian plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs.  But the fossil was still partially encased in solid rock. So Godefroit and his team brought the rock to the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility to peer at the mineralized bones still locked inside using the particle accelerator. They said convince me its a fake, the facilitys paleontologist Vincent Fernandez tells the New York Times. I thought it would be very obvious. But I looked at it for hours and hours and I couldnt find anything.  They found more of the same bizarre mixpieces of the swan like neck and duck snout were encased alongside the stubby paddle arms, confirming the creature was real.  The new creatures nameHalszkaraptor escuillieihonors Escuilli\u00e9 for his role in discovering the fossil, and is a tribute to the Polish paleontologist Halszka Osm\u00f3lska responsible for discovering at least a dozen Mongolian dinosaurs, Yong reports. Once the fossil was substantiated, Escuilli\u00e9 got to work on repatriating it to Mongolia as soon as Godefroit and his team finish studying it in Belgium.  Halszkaraptor is the latest of the theropods its taxonomic siblings including the iconic Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor. Like its mostly meat eating kin, it appears to be a predator, but unlike them it is the first theropod suited to a life hunting in the seas.  Its duck like snout was threaded with channels to carry nerves and blood vessels, reports Greshko. This would boost sensitivity the same way we see in modern crocodiles and aquatic birds. Its bill jammed full of tiny teeth perfect for grabbing fish suggest Halszkaraptor specialized in diving after ancient sea creatures for its mealtimes, a long extinct version of the modern cormorant. Its long neck is streamlined for swimming, smashing sideways into prey, or darting down to nab fish in a precursor of the herons fishing strategy.  But story of how Halszkaraptor came to be is far from clear. The strong hindlimbs allowed it to walk on land with ease, reports Greshko, allowing it to still return to land to lay its eggs. Those same powerful legs could also provide a strong kick while swimming underwater, but with sharp claws instead of webbed toes their hindlimbs were likely better suited to running. And while the elongated and flattened bones match the proportion of swimming birds, Yong points out Godefroit and his team arent yet convinced they served as flippers for the usual creature. Until scientists understand how the limbs joined at the shoulders, they dont know if they could be moved propulsively like a penguin, or if their utility is another strange quirk yet to be unravelled. For all the mysteries that remain, one thing is clear. Someday soon, someone is going to name this awkward sharp toothed swan as their favorite dinosaur.

Since the discovery of the bones of the young hominin between 1994 and 1997 researchers have dated the remains, examined the bones and published many papers on what is considered one of the most complete skeletons of a human ancestor ever found. Now, reports the BBC, after 20 years of excavation and painstaking cleaning, the remains have gone on public display for the first time in South Africa. The journey out of the dustbin of history has been long and painstaking for Little Foot. David McKenzie at CNN reports that in 1994, paleontologist Ron Clarke was looking through a box of fossils from the Sterkfontein cave system in South Africa that had been blasted out by lime miners. He found four tiny fragments of ankle\u00a0bones he believed came from an early human ancestor. In 1997, he found more bones from the skeleton at a nearby medical school and decided to look for more of Little Foot in the cave itself. With his assistants, he found\u00a0remains embedded in a concrete like material called breccia. They cut\u00a0Little Foot out of the breccia in blocks, then began the process of removing the tiny fragile fragments from the stone. It took until 2012 to locate and remove all traces of Little Foot from the cave. Then even more difficult work began. We used very small tools, like needles to excavate it. Thats why it took so long, Clarke tells the BBC. It was like excavating a fluffy pastry out of concrete. The results, however, are amazing. While Lucy, the most famous early hominin skeleton found in Ethiopia in the 1970s is about 40 percent complete, Little Foot is 90 percent complete and still has her head,\u00a0reports\u00a0Elaina\u00a0Zachos\u00a0at\u00a0National Geographic.\u00a0She is believed to be a different species of Australopithecus\u200b\u00a0than Lucy and may be older. Lucy is believed to be about 3.2 million years old while Clarke and his team have dated Little Foot to 3.67 million years, though that date is controversial. Zachos reports that Little Foot made her debut at the Hominin Vault at the University of the Witwatersrands Evolutionary Studies Institute in Johannesburg on Wednesday. Next year, McKenzie reports the team examining Little Foot expects to release an estimated 25 scientific papers about the fossil,\u00a0sure to stir up the ongoing debate on whether\u00a0 South Africa, not East\u00a0Africa, is where much of early human evolution took place."}, {"title": "Mammoth Remains Unearthed at Michigan Farm, Hint at Ancient Human Butchering", "author": "Tatiana Walk-Morris", "date": "December 4, 2017", "doc": "Two years ago, James Bristle, a Michigan soybean farmer, found the bones of a woolly Columbian mammoth hybrid while installing a drainage system on one of his fields. Now, according to a press release from the University of Michigan, theyve found more. Researchers have unearthed around 40 additional bones, including the skull, tusks and teeth of an ice\u00a0age creature. We got the kind of information that we need to do the science right, and we were also able to recover an impressive amount of additional material from this animal, says University of Michigan paleontologist Daniel Fisher, who led both Bristle digs and who is overseeing the analysis of the bones and the environmental samples, says in the press release. Im confident that as a result of this second excavation, well have more insight into what happened here. The researchers decided to revisit the site after learning that one of the mammoth bones had a radiocarbon date of more than 15,000 years old and hints from the first find suggest the creature was butchered by ancient humans. The mammoths remains were discovered within pond sediments and researchers believe\u00a0that early humans\u00a0cut up the carcass and stored part of the animal at the bottom of a pond. Researchers plan to extract and analyze the fungal spores and pollen grains within the sediments to get a better sense of when the mammoths were present, when they became extinct and how their vegetation changed over time. Though researchers were only able to recover a skull with both tusks attached and multiple other bones during the first dig in 2015, which only lasted a day, they found out that the mammoth lived to an age of around 45 and had likely tromped across the lands \u00a0between 11,700 and 15,000 years ago,\u00a0writes Martin Slagter for MLive. The bones found in the initial excavation were later displayed at the University of Michigans Museum of Natural History in November 2016. It was such a hurried thing the first time around, Bristle, who renamed his farm Mammoth Acres after that find, says in the release. So this is an opportunity to complete the discovery process. The recent find contributes to other scientific efforts to understand the life and demise of the furry giant. Recent studies suggest that the lack of genetic diversity in the dwindling mammoth population was possibly one of several factors that led to its extinction,\u00a0Charlie Wood reported for\u00a0The Christian Science Monitor\u00a0earlier this year. Its not entirely clear whether these genetic mutations led to the demise of the Wrangel Island mammoths, but the timing their extinction is of interest to researchers. These findings, experts say, could contribute to our modern conservation efforts. Though the latest finding doesnt hold answers to the mystery of the mammoths demise, it does help researchers further tease apart the life histories of these massive beasts and could provide clues to their interactions with ancient humans."}, {"title": "Cache of 120-Million-Year-Old Fossilized Pterosaur Eggs Found in China", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "December 1, 2017", "doc": "Pterosaurs\u00a0are rarely preserved in the fossil record. These reptiles soared through the skies more than 100 million years ago, but the light bones that helped them fly\u00a0break down easily with time. Their soft shelled eggs are even harder to find until recently, only 11 had ever been discovered. But as Reuters reports, paleontologists in northwestern China recently hit pterosaur pay dirt when they discovered a trove of 215 fossilized pterosaur eggs. Even more remarkably, 16 of these eggs contained partial embryonic remains, allowing scientists to glean unprecedented insight into the pterosaurs development.  The cluster of eggs, described recently in the journal Science, was found at a site in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. All of the fossils belong to the species Hamipterus tianshanensis, a large pterosaur with an elongated skull, sharp teeth and a wingspan of about 11 feet. The eggs are estimated to be 120 million years old, and the cache represents the first time that scientists have discovered pterosaur embryos preserved in three dimensions.  We want to call this region Pterosaur Eden, Shunxing Jiang, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, tells\u00a0Reuters.   The eggs were fossilized in lake sediments, which show signs of disturbance by fast moving water, according to Michael Greshko of National Geographic. Because of this, researchers\u00a0hypothesize that storms flooded a pterosaur nesting site and dragged the eggs into the lake. And this may have happened more than once over time. The eggs were preserved in four distinct layers within the sediment, leading scientists to believe that Hamipterus, like birds and turtles of today, repeatedly returned to the same nesting siteand, on occasion, lost their eggs to inclement weather.  Researchers were able to glean other insights into pterosaur breeding. As Alessandra Potenza reports for the\u00a0Verge, scientists believe that pterosaurs only laid two eggs at a time, so the large quantity of eggs found at the site suggests that that the creatures converged to lay their eggs together. The shells of the eggs were soft and surrounded by a thick inner membranemuch like the eggs of modern day snakes and lizards. And like snakes and lizards, pterosaurs probably buried their eggs.  It was the embryos, however, that yielded the most surprising discovery. Though many paleontologists had believed that pterosaurs could fly not long after they were born, the\u00a0Hamipterus\u00a0eggs revealed that in late stage embryos, the forelimbswhich would have been crucial for flyingwere less developed than the hind limbs. This suggests that\u00a0Hampiterus\u00a0newborns were likely to walk on the ground, but were not able to fly in the sky, Xiaolin Wang, also a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, says\u00a0in a\u00a0statement.  If\u00a0Hamipterus\u00a0babies could not fly, they probably needed some parental care, the authors of the study write. Indeed, amidst the trove of fossilized eggs, palaeontologists found the remains of an individual that is estimated to have been about two years old at the time of its death. This little pterosaur was not yet fully developed, supporting the idea that pterosaurs had long incubation periods, Wang said.  Not all experts agree with the studys conclusions, however. David Unwin, a paleobiologist at the University of Leicester, tells the\u00a0Verges Potenza that late stage pterosaur embryos found elsewhere in China and in Argentina had well developed wing bones. The newly discovered embryos, Unwin said, looked as though they had only reached the mid point of their development.  In an article that was published alongside the study, Denis Deeming of Britains University of Lincoln in Britain noted that it is important to be cautious and not to infer too many aspects of the life history of\u00a0Hamipterus\u00a0from what remains a limited data set, Potenza reports.  In the hopes of providing further insight into the pterosaurs early life phases, paleontologists plan to return to the site. They believe that around 100 additional eggs may lie beneath the exposed fossils.  We know there are more eggs and embryos in the field, Wang says in the Chinese Academy of Sciences statement, and we will spend much more time in studying this incredible pterosaur."}, {"title": "This Dinosaur Was Much Fuzzier Than Scientists Once Thought", "author": "Tatiana Walk-Morris", "date": "November 30, 2017", "doc": "Though modern day birds sport a coat of streamlined plumage, it turns out that their ancient relatives were surprisingly fluffy. In a new study, published in the journal Paleontology, researchers from the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom compared the well preserved fossilized feathers of the crow sized, bird like dinosaur Anchiornis to those of other dinosaurs and extinct birds, discovering that the ancient feathers are much shaggier than their modern avian relatives. Anchiornis is an early member of the paraves, a group that includes true birds as well as feathered dinosaurs, according to the university press release. Originally thought to be a bird, Anchiornis has long fascinated and puzzled researchers due to both its similarities and many differences to modern birds, Jason Bittel reported for National Geographic earlier this year. In the latest study, researchers found that the feathers covering Anchiornis body had short quills with long, independent, flexible barbs sticking out at low angles in two opposing blades. This organization results in an overall forked shape for each feather and likely produced a surprisingly fluffy and soft texture. In contrast, the feathers of modern birds are tightly zipped, according to the press release. This means that the fluffy ancient creatures likely had a more difficult time repelling water. The ancient feathers also appear less aerodynamic, which would have made Anchiornis a less nimble flyer. But the downy layer likely kept the creatures warm. The four winged Anchiornis also sported elongated feathers arranged in a fringe across the backs of their limbs and tailan arrangement the researchers believe would make the creatures more effective gliders than fliers. Overall, it does suggest that truly modern feathers and wings could have evolved later in time or in extinct bird lineages more closely related to modern birds than we might have expected, Evan Saitta, a paleontologist at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom and author of the new study, tells Dan Robitzski of Live Science. The latest study is helping scientists tease through the details of not only the physiology but also the behavior of early birds, Saitta explains in the press release. Its really exciting to be able to work with the scientists at the forefront of these discoveries, and to show others what we believe these fluffy, toothy almost birds looked like as they went about their Jurassic business, Saitta says. To help further visualize the ancient beasts, the team collaborated with Rebecca Gelernter, a scientific illustrator and graphic designer, to create a life like image of the animal. Anchiornis color patterns were derived from previous fossilized pigment studies, and other previous studies have depicted its wing feathers multi tiered layering, according to the university press release. In this case, the creatures flesh has been recreated by looking closely at the fossil beneath laser fluorescence.  As a result of this study and other recent work, this is now possible to visualize Anchiornis to an unprecedented degree, Saitta says in the release. Its easy to see it as a living animal with complex behaviors, not just a flattened fossil. This latest study adds to the mounting evidence that many ancient dinosaurs sported coats of feathers. For example, the Velociraptor, a fleet footed dinosaur that was depicted as a sleek lizard in the film Jurassic Park, actually had feathers, according to a 2007 study of one of the creatures forearms. The latest find continues to work against the\u00a0Jurassic Park vision of dinos, deepening our understanding about how these creatures looked and functioned."}, {"title": "When the Dinos Went Away, Mammals Came Out (in Daylight) to Play", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "November 7, 2017", "doc": "Paleontologists believe that the first mammals to evolve on Earth were small nocturnal creatures that used a keen sense of smell and hearing to operate in the dark, which was a good place to be in the age of the dinosaurs. These days, many mammal species spend most of their time operating during the daytime, and many other species are crepuscular, which means they do most of their hunting, mating and interacting in the early morning and twilight hours. But when did mammals make the switch from\u00a0the night life to day life?\u00a0Now, reports Gretchen Vogel at Science, a new study pinpoints the time in the distant past when mammals came out of the dark. And it turns out, its immediately after the demise of the dinosaurs. As Vogel reports, paleontologists have had difficulty determining the behavior of ancient animals just by looking at their fossils. Typically, they assume an animal is nocturnal if it has features like large eye sockets and certain configurations of the nasal cavity. But that work is largely speculative and cant answer the question of when mammals first waddled into the daylight. In search of answers, a group of researchers from University of College London and Tel Aviv University worked backward, analyzing the lifestyles and behavior of 2,415 mammal species that exist today, writes\u00a0George\u00a0Dvorsky\u00a0for\u00a0Gizmodo. Using an algorithm, they were able to reconstruct the likely behavior of their ancestral mammals back to the beginning, when mammals evolved from a reptilian ancestor 220 to 160 million years ago,\u00a0Agence\u00a0France Presse\u00a0reports. The researchers used two different variations of the mammalian family tree, according to\u00a0a press release, but the results were the same. Mammals came into the light between 52 and 33 million years ago. The dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago. The research appears in the journal Nature Ecology  Evolution. We were very surprised to find such close correlation between the disappearance of dinosaurs and the beginning of daytime activity in mammals, but we found the same result unanimously using several alternative analyses, Ph.D students and lead author Roi Maor of Tel Aviv University says in the press release. As quickly as 200,000 years after the disappearance of the dinosaurs creatures began emerging. For example, the ancestor of camels, hippos and deer may have begun operating at least partially during the daytime or twilight hours, Maor\u00a0tells Vogel. The ancestors of primates were some of the first mammals to begin living primarily during the day, AFP reports, likely venturing into the light as early as 52 million years ago. The eyes of primates reflect this early emergence. While most mammal species even today have lots of rods, specialized photo receptors in the eye that can detect low level light, they lack a fovea, an area of the retina where focus is strongest and detects\u00a0color in high light. Humans and primates, however, do have the feature, probably because weve had a few extra million years\u00a0in the sunshine to develop the adaptation. \u00a0 The researchers cant say for certain that theres causation between the demise of the dinosaurs and the rise of daytime mammals, but they suggest that the end of the thunder lizards reduced the number of predators and opened up many niches in the environment, ending what is sometimes called the nocturnal bottleneck.\u00a0 Its very difficult to relate behavior changes in mammals that lived so long ago to ecological conditions at the time, so we cant say that the dinosaurs dying out caused mammals to start being active in the daytime, co author and geneticist at University College, London Kate Jones says in the release. However, we see a clear correlation in our findings. While other researchers believe the study was well done, they caution that there are still a lot of gaps in our knowledge of ancient mammalian behavior that an algorithm cant settle. Until we find a way to look at fossils and directly figure out how these extinct animals were behaving, it will still be a prediction, Stephen Brusatte from the University of Edinburgh, who not involved in the study, tells Dvorsky. It may be that the end Cretaceous extinction caused a big shift from nocturnal to diurnal mammals, but it wouldnt surprise me if some mammals living alongside the dinosaurs were also active during the day and we just havent found a good way to determine that yet. That will be the next big step in testing these results. The team hopes to do just that, by adding more species the mammalian family tree to help refine their data."}, {"title": "Four-Horned Giraffe Ancestor Unearthed in Spain", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "November 2, 2017", "doc": "Giraffes are weird animalstheres the long neck, the fetching eyelashes, strange knobbed horns, long legs and unique cobblestone patterned hide. Its hard to imagine the evolutionary pressures that produced such a strange creature, though luminaries including Lamarck and Darwin had some thoughts. Now, the discovery of rare, nearly complete fossil of a giraffe ancestor may provide new insight into how the skyscraper of the savannah came to be, reports Karen Weintraub at The New York Times. Described in a journal article in PLOS One, paleontologists uncovered the almost complete remains of an unknown giraffid species at Cerro de los Batallones near the city of Madrid, Spain, along with incomplete skeletons of three other individuals form the species. Weintraub reports that the specimen, named Decennatherium rex\u00a0by the researchers, is around nine\u00a0million years old and has four short horns like protrusions, or ossicones, on its headone pair curves forward and a longer pair sweeps backward. \u00a0Modern giraffes only have two ossicones. Its silhouette is also quite different, with the nine foot tall creature resembling a moose with a long neck or an okapi, the other member of the giraffid family thats alive today. Researchers have discovered over 30 extinct ancestors of the giraffe over the years, but none of their skulls survived well enough to shed much light on relationship between the giraffids, according to\u00a0a press release. This new specimen, which includes a skull, is allowing researchers to build the giraffid family tree by studying the anatomy and morphology of the creatures. Its something most paleontologists dream of and very rarely find, Ari Grossman, an anatomist at Midwestern University in Glendale, Arizona, not involved in the study tells Weintraub. The discovery in and of itself was breathtaking. The fossils have much to say about ancient giraffes. For instance, the fact that these animals were found in Spain suggests that giraffids ranged well into Europe. The bones also show that there were differences between the males and females of the species. Most importantly, as\u00a0Jake Buehler at Gizmodo reports, the fossils have helped researchers sort out the confusing giraffid lineage. The new Decennatherium species represents the earliest known member of a group of four horned giraffids known as sivatheres which, along with another branch known as samotheres, ruled Africa and Asia for millions of years. The last members of that group only went extinct during the last Ice Age. The findings show that this sivatheres samotheres branch of giraffes is millions of years older than previously thought. The study also indicates that our remaining giraffids, the giraffe and the okapi, are actually pretty far apart in evolutionary terms reports Weintraub. Were preserving relics of two very distinct groups of giraffes that were morphologically very different, Grossman says. Its believed that the giraffids first appeared about 25 million years ago, and spread across Africa and Eurasia. But that long evolutionary legacy may not last much longer. Okapis, which live in the forests of Central Africa, are currently listed\u00a0as endangered and are subject to hunting and habitat loss. And late last year giraffes, which most conservationist did not worry too much about, were listed as vulnerable. Their numbers have dropped\u00a040 percent over the last 30 years\u00a0due to poaching and habitat loss.\u00a0 But perhaps, discoveries such as the new four horned species will remind us just how uniqueand worthy of protectionthese animals truly are."}, {"title": "Scientists Unearth Near-Complete Marine Reptile Fossil in India", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "October 27, 2017", "doc": "When paleontologists in India unearthed a prehistoric fossil in the countrys Gujarat province, they expected that like most other vertebrate fossils in this region It would exist only in fragments. Instead, as Michael Greshko reports for National Geographic, the team unearthed the nearly complete skeleton of an ichthyosaura large marine reptile that glided through the seas while dinosaurs roamed the earth.  The fossil was discovered last year, embedded in hard sedimentary rock in the Kachchh region of Gujarat. When paleontologists finally managed to free the skeleton it took 1,500 person hours, they found that it was largely intact, with only parts of the skull and a number of tail bones missing, according to the BBC.  Describing their discovery in the journal PLOS One, researchers estimate that the ichthyosaurs lived between 152 and 157 million years ago, a time when the Gujarat area of India was covered by tropical waters. The skeleton belongs to the Ophthalmosaurus\u00a0family of ichthyosaurshuge eyed creatures with long, thin mandibles that helped them catch fish and squid. The fossils teeth offer further insights into the ichthyosaurs diet.  We could infer from wear patterns on its teeth that this ichthyosaur was a top tier predator that fed on hard and abrasive food material, including marine molluscs ammonoids\u00a0and belemnites, fish and possibly other marine reptiles, Guntupalli Prasad, a paleontologist at the University of Delhi who worked on the excavation, told Beth Baker of PLOS Research News  The discovery of the Indian ichthyosaur is spectacular for a number of reasons. For one, the fossil represents the first Jurassic era\u00a0ichthyosaur ever found India. It is also the most complete\u00a0fossil of the creature discovered in the country. In general, ichthyosaur fossils are rare so far south to date, most remains have been found in Europe and North America.  The Indian ichthyosaur was closely related to more northerly specimens, suggesting that the creatures were traveling far and wide at a time when the ancient continent Pangaea was slowly breaking up into smaller landmasses. Prasad tells\u00a0PLOS Research News that the ichthyosaur appears to have traversed modern day Europe, Madagascar, South America and Europe.

But some were as cute as kittens, reveals a new study on a chicken sized dinosaur found in the roughly 125 million year old rock of China.  Sinosauropteryx prima first made a splash back in 1996 when it was unveiled as the first non avian dinosaur to have plumage, with a defined line of fluff clearly visible along its neck and tail. Then, in 2010, paleontologists announced that they had recovered the ancient color pattern of this dinosaur from the distribution of pigment carrying organelles in the fluff, its tail banded rust and white. Now a new study by University of Bristol paleontologist Jakob Vinther and colleagues has further refined our image of what this dinosaur was like in life. We thought that perhaps more information could be gleaned from taking high resolution images with crossed polarized light, Vinther saysand that effort produced a new image, which could\u00a0offer additional clues about how and where the cuddly looking carnivore lived.\n\nThe new image of Sinosauropteryx is of an almost raccoon like dinosaur. The restoration Vinther and colleagues have produced sports the familiar banded tail, visible just by looking at the fossil itself. But the dinosaur also appears to have\u00a0an eye mask and a countershaded pattern on its body, with rust colored protofeathers above and white fluff below.\n\nThis new pattern not only comes from what was preserved on a pair of exceptional Sinosauropteryx fossils, but what was not. Vinther and colleagues found preserved protofeathers around the dinosaurs eyes, chest, back and tail. Yet, the researchers argue, the dinosaur was probably even fluffier than a first glance would suggest. Thats because the protofeathers in those blank spots were unpigmented, Vinther and colleagues argue, and so they decayed while the red, pigmented protofeathers persisted thanks to their sturdier structure.\n\nUniversity of Maryland paleontologist Thomas Holtz urges some caution over this interpretation, however. While its possible that the bald spots on the fossils are places where white protofeathers were not preserved, Holtz points out the possibility that there could have been colored fluff there that was lost after death. Decaying bodies can slough off outer layers in part or in whole, Holtz says, so I would be more cautious than they are about the absence of evidence equals preserve of white hypothesis. Still, Holtz says, the reconstruction looks like a reasonable speculation of a living animal, so I wouldnt be surprised if it turns out to be accurate.  Restoring the color palette of long deceased dinosaurs is about more than sending paleoartists back to their easels, though. Vinther and colleagues point out how dinosaur color might offer clues to dinosaur biology that would otherwise remain hidden. The bandit mask, Vinther says, is a common pattern in birds and seems to either disguise the eye or reduce glare, making it easier for them to see in bright habitats while also hiding their own eyes and making the bandits harder to see. \u00a0 The color pattern of\u00a0Sinosauropteryx\u00a0might also tell us something about where this dinosaur liked to roam. Countershaded color patterns are a form of camouflage, and through light tests on 3D models the researchers propose that pattern on\u00a0Sinosauropteryx\u00a0best fits life in a more open habitat. This would have been a risky move. There were larger predatory dinosaurs running around the same clearings, making camouflage all the more important for little\u00a0Sinosauropteryx\u00a0as it darted through the low lying vegetation.\n\nRegarding the connection between camouflage and ecology, Holtz notes, there are animals with\u00a0Sinosauropteryx like color patterns alive today that prefer more forested habitats. Tree kangaroos show countershading, Holtz says, and the forest dwelling raccoon dogs wear color patterns much like\u00a0Sinosauropteryx. Furthermore, University of Ghent feather expert Matthew Shawkey says, the dinosaurs striped tail might have been pretty conspicuous. I imagine that this would stick out like a sore thumb even if the abdomen is camouflaged by countershading, Shawkey says, especially if this pattern was meant as a signal for\u00a0Sinosauropteryx\u00a0to communicate with each other. More work needs to be done on tying patterns to habitat preferences, Holtz says, with any hypothesis about a dinosaurs habits checked against clues from geology, prehistoric plants and fossil pollen.  Still, by refining these connections, paleontologists may be able to pull back the paleontological curtain\u00a0on lost worlds. Drawing from his\u00a0previous research\u00a0restoring the coloration of a small horned dinosaur called\u00a0Psittacosaurus, Vinther points out that this small herbivore likely preferred more closed, forested habitats. This could mean that even though\u00a0Sinosauropteryx\u00a0and\u00a0Psittacosaurus\u00a0were neighbors, they may never have met each other. Perhaps we can in the future say which herbivores and theropods out of the many found in Jehol actually interacted regularly and which rarely saw each other, Vinther says.\n\nIntegument plays a hugely significant role in the lives of living animals, Holtz says, so the more we learn of it in fossil species, the better we can begin to interpret their life. This goes beyond the fossil record. Efforts like shading in\u00a0Sinosauropteryx\u00a0could spur zoologists to get a better idea of how color relates to behavior and ecology in modern animals, allowing researchers to draw parallels between the past and present.  Whats certain is that, from our perspective, dinosaurs will keep changing. After all, despite their fossilized nature, much about dinosaurs is not set in stone."}, {"title": "Why Some Woolly Rhinos Grew Ribs on Their Necks", "author": "Marissa Fessenden", "date": "September 22, 2017", "doc": "Some 350,000 years ago, the woolly rhino first browsed the shrubs and grasses of Europe and Asia with thick fleshy lips similar to their relatives living today. Unlike living rhinoceroses, however, these mammals sported shaggy coats and impressive humps. And just before they went extinct, its possible the animals showed another morphological oddity ribs growing from their neck.  A new study,\u00a0published last month in the journal\u00a0PeerJ, suggests that an unusually high proportion of woolly rhinos that lived between 35,0000 and 115,000 years ago sported these seemingly misplaced\u00a0ribs in their neck, reports Susan Milius for Science News.  Researchers from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in\u00a0the Netherlands analyzed the neck vertebrae of 32 woolly rhinos in their collection as well as 56 skeletons from existing rhino species. In about 16 percent of the woolly rhinos, they found spots where ribs would have attached on the lowest neck vertebrae, or cervical vertebrae. This is not where ribs normally sprout. None of the modern rhino skeletons displayed such spots.  Judging from the rib facets, the cervical ribs were quite large, the researchers write in the study.  In humans, such cervical ribs only affect about 0.5 to 1 percent of the population. A higher percentage can indicate the population is isolated, which have a higher chance of displaying abnormal genetic traits. Higher numbers also show up in children with cancer and in fetuses that did not survive.  The extra ribs may not have hurt the rhinos directly, but the researchers explain that such an unusually high percentage could indicate that the population was\u00a0declining and inbreeding was increasing. That would have bumped up the number of genetic mutations, including some that could cause cervical rib development. Alternatively, stress during pregnancy could have created the extra ribs. Diseases, famine, cold and other stressors can lead to disturbances of early development, the researchers write.  In earlier research, \u00a0Frietson\u00a0Galis, one of the authors on the latest study,\u00a0and colleagues found that woolly mammoths also had\u00a0cervical ribs more frequently than expected. They suggest that cervical ribs could be a sign of a failing population. Since the\u00a0modern rhinoceros skeletons the researchers analyzed date from a time when populations were healthy, its not surprising that they didnt find extra ribs. But sadly, with current rhino populations dwindling, its possible they could soon have more data about these unexpected signs of the creatures impending demise."}, {"title": "Modern Humans and Neanderthals May Be More Similar Than We Imagined", "author": "Ryan P. Smith", "date": "September 22, 2017", "doc": "When the skull of the child was first discovered, it raised more questions than answers. Although it was nearly 50,000 years old, unearthed deep within the Sidr\u00f3n limestone caves of Asturias, Spain, it could easily be mistaken for that of a modern day youth. The archaeologists who later examined it wanted to know What was the story of this young Neanderthal? And how similar was he to todays young Homo sapiens?  As the skeletons additional bones began coming to light one by one, the picture came into focus. When the first remains of the juvenile skeleton started to appear, says Luis Rios, a paleontologist at Madrids Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales and a coauthor on a just published study\u00a0in the journal\u00a0Science, we realized that it was a very interesting skeleton.  The reason the skeleton was so compelling to researchers was twofold. First, as a child skeleton, the specimen offered a window into how Neanderthals grew and developed into adults, which researchers could then compare against modern Homo sapiens. Second, the unusually pristine condition of the jawbone and teeth made it possible to draw a precise estimate of the juveniles age at the time of death.  Dental development is very important in human evolution and in primates, said Antonio Rosas, the museums chair of paleoanthropology and lead author on the study, during a press conference on Wednesday. And also in establishing the chronological agethat is, the age of the individual in years or days and months, or in an absolute time.  Through an analysis of naturally occurring markings on the juveniles first left upper molar, Rosas and his coauthors concluded that the child had almost certainly died between the ages of 7.61 and 7.78 years. While DNA testing was inconclusive, canine tooth size and general bone robustness indicate that he was also male. Further findings, Rosas says, suggest\u00a0that humans may not be as distinct from Neanderthals as we often tell ourselveswith two key exceptions. It was over 23 years ago that a band of spelunkers in northern Spain chanced upon a cache of Neanderthal skeletons, 13 in all, in a part of the Sidr\u00f3n cave complex now known as the Galer\u00eda del Osario the Tunnel of Bones. Comprising several adult males, several adolescent males, several adult females and several infants, the 49,000 year old collection whetted the appetites of evolutionary scientists worldwide. By now, 2,500 distinct bones have been unearthed in the regionan incredible windfall for the international scientific community.  As more and more of the childs skeleton was unearthed, the fullness of the skeleton became apparent to Rosas and his team. Ultimately, Rios says, we were able to approach bone maturation besides dental maturation. The initial motivation for the work was the study of growth and maturation, but we kept adding more and more pieces, until the excavation finished and we had a very complete Neanderthal skeleton.  The team performed a full examination of the skeleton in order to contrast the stages of growth in the Neanderthal child with the equivalent stages of growth in\u00a0Homo sapiens. What they found was that the Neanderthal was nearly indistinguishable from\u00a0Homo sapiens\u00a0in the degree to which its bones had developed. From hands to knees, says Rosas, the general pattern of growth is very similar to that of modern humans.  However, his team did observe two important points of divergencewhich could lend insight into how Neanderthals developed and aged. The first was in the spinal column. CT scans of the Neanderthals spine revealed that certain vertebrae in the boys backbone had not yet fused those\u00a0of\u00a0a modern human child would have fused by age 5 or 6.  Second, inspection of the craniumwhich houses the brainimplied that brain development in Neanderthals may have been a slightly more protracted process than in\u00a0Homo sapiens. The endocranial volume of the specimen was about 87.5 percent of the average adult Neanderthals, the team reports. By contrast, for a modern 7 year old human, the brain is typically 95 percent of the way to its adult size. While the findings are intriguing, results that rely on a single specimen should be taken with a very large grain of salt, says University of Zurich paleoanthropologist Christoph Zollikofer. Comparing this Neanderthals brain size against the adult average for the whole of the Neanderthal speciesas opposed to its own adult brain size, which we can never know since it died as a juvenileis bound to result in shaky conclusions.  It could well be the case that this specimen is just a normal kid with normal Homo sapiens like brain growth, Zollikofer says.  Rosas acknowledges the limitations inherent in this kind of study. Its a problem that pervades the fossil record, that sometimes conclusions rely on few individuals, he says. Nevertheless, he maintains that such work is essential to the slow but steady progress of evolutionary research. In future years, he says, we will try to incorporate other fossils, and later juvenile stages, to help round out the picture.  For now, Rosas views this research as one more step along the path toward a fuller understanding of humanitys rich evolutionary history. We thought that our way of growing was unique to our species, he says. Turns out, we\u00a0Homo sapiens\u00a0may be a lot closer to our past than any of us bargained for."}, {"title": "Look Into the Creepy-Cute Eyes of This Reconstructed, 500-Million-Year-Old Creature", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "September 19, 2017", "doc": "About half a billion years ago, Scandinavia was covered by\u00a0Agnostus pisiformis, an ocean going arthropod about one\u00a0centimeter across that looks like a very complicated little clam. Though fossils of the creature are common, sometimes its hard to visualize such tiny critter. Thats why geology professor Mats E. Eriksson of Lund University in Sweden commissioned sculptures of Agnostus to go along with a research paper in Earth Science Reviews, which collates just about everything we know about the species. As it turns out, the creature is also, kind of, cute?  Stephanie Pappas at LiveScience reports that Eriksson was able to commission the model because Agnostus is often well preserved in shale and limestone. Not only does its hard outer shell survive, but occasionally its soft tissue has also been fossilized, giving researchers lots of material to work with. The incredible degree of preservational detail means that we can grasp the entire anatomy of the animal, which, in turn, reveals a lot about its ecology and mode of life, Eriksson says in a press release.  For instance, its known from the fossil record that the animal starts out as a larva. Over several life stages it grows and sheds its hard exoskeleton. Its also believed that it would grab little pieces of organic material out of the ocean. For paleontologists, however, the species most important trait is its mere existence. Pappas reports that Agnostus is a great index fossil. If researchers find a layer filled with Agnostus, they can accurately date that rock, which gives them a reference for other fossils they may find.\u00a0\u00a0  Pappas reports that Erikkson hired 10 Tons studio in Denmark to create the sculptures. First, the little creature was hand sculpted in clay. Then wax molds were poured before the artists produced the final models made of translucent silicon, each the size of a dinner plate. The sculptors made several versions, including what Agnostus would have looked like swimming, and a rolled up model demonstrating how its clam like exoskeleton would have protected the creature. Theres also one that mimics what the arthropod looks like under a scanning electron microscope.  While the creature is a clammy, bug like thing with tentacles, its appearance has been inspiring a number of reactions. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder of course, but to me it is beautiful for a number of reasons, Erikkson tells George Dvorsky at Gizmodo. I love its anatomy, but I guess it becomes even more beautiful in my eyes because of its long and convoluted research history, and its applicability. Finally, being known from exceptionally well preserved material we have detailed insights into its anatomy... What is there not to love?  Erikkson tells Pappas he hopes the sculpture will help draw more attention to the Cambrian explosion, the time period when life evolved from simple bacteria to much more complex ocean dwelling creatures.\u00a0Getting the public excited and inspired to learn more about ancient animals is nothing new. Dinosaurs were first popularized by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins who displayed sculptures of the creatures at Londons Crystal Palace in 1851, part of a tradition of Paleoart that has been evolving over the course of 200 years."}, {"title": "Researchers Find 98-Million-Year-Old Horned Vampire Ant Encased in Amber", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "September 13, 2017", "doc": "Encountering a floating mat of fire ants may be a modern nightmare, but a newly described ant species is even more fearsome. As Josh Gabbatiss at New Scientist reports, researchers recently described a new genus and species of hell ant that has a metal reinforced horn and jaws designed to slurp up blood. The critter was encapsulated 98 million years ago during the Cretaceous period in sticky tree resin. Discovered in present day Myanmar, it is now preserved in an amber tomb.\u00a0The researchers dubbed the new species Linguamyrmex vladi\u00a0Vladi for Vlad the Impaler, aka the original Dracula and described its fearsome looks\u00a0in the journal Systematic Entomology. As Gabbatiss reports, instead of the usual ant mouthparts, Vladi has two large mandibular blades. Its believed that when prey passed by the ant, they would set\u00a0off trigger hairs. The blades would then activate, flipping up to impale the hapless creatures on the ants horn. The flipped up mandibles had grooves that acted as a type of gutter that could then direct haemolymph, the insect version of blood, into the ants mouthbut this is just an educated guess.  Until we find a specimen with the prey item trapped, which is probably a matter of time, were left to speculate, lead author of the study Phillip Barden at the New Jersey Institute of Technology tells Gabbatiss. Equally amazing, according to the paper, is that X ray imaging shows the horn, or clypeal paddle, is impregnated with metal particles, likely to strengthen it and help it withstand multiple impacts. That same type of reinforcement is found in the pincers of some modern beetles that contain zinc or iron. While Vladis horn is likely unique, its not the only potentially blood drinking hell ant researchers have discovered. The first hell ant was collected in the\u00a01920s, but it wasnt until 1996 that a Russian researcher recognized the insect trapped in amber,\u00a0Michelle Z. Donahue wrote for\u00a0Smithsonian.com\u00a0last year. Over the last two decades, entomologists have described five other species of ancient hell ants. And this motley crew makes up the oldest true ants in the world. There are no ant fossils older than these, full stop, Barden tells Donahue. But we estimate from molecular data and DNA analysis that they diversified 20 to 60 million years earlier. Though they are not directly related to modern ants, there are some similaritiesthough not many. Recently, researchers described how the trap jaw ant, a genus of tropical ant, also uses trigger hairs that set off their mega jaws, which snap shut in half a millisecond700 times faster than a blink of an eye. When talking about the trap jaw ant, North Carolina State University entomologist Magdalena Sorger tells Carrie Arnold at National Geographic,\u00a0I dont know that theres another species of ant thats as strange looking as these. But she may not have been looking far enough in the past."}, {"title": "The Ultimate Summer Camp Activity: Digging for Dinosaurs", "author": "Mike Sager", "date": "September 13, 2017", "doc": "The bone digger is unloading his truck when three of his teen volunteers come loping toward him, flush with excitement. I think we found a theropod hand says Isiah Newbins. The then rising senior from Cherokee Trails High School in Aurora, Colorado, is dripping sweat his clothes are muddied with the slippery, volcanic clay known hereabouts as gumbo. His face is alight with the glow of discoveryequal parts scientific interest and little boy hope. Its been a long day in the Hell Creek Formation, a 300 foot thick bed of sandstone and mudstone that dates back to a period between 65 and 67.5 million years ago, to a time before dinosaurs became extinct. Stretching across the Dakotas and Montana in Wyoming, its known as the Lance Formation, Hell Creek is one of the richest fossil troves in the world, left behind by great rivers that once flowed eastward toward an inland sea. Its August 2016, and Newbins has been hunting fossils in the heat with a team from the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. Every summer the DMNS, in cooperation with the Marmarth Research Foundation, offers several weeks of programs and research opportunities for students, academics, and serious hobbyists. A sort of ultimate fantasy camp for would be paleontologists, the age among the 35 attendees and staff this week ranges from 15 to 80. Theropods were carnivorous dinosaurs, bipedal predators like the T. rexperhaps the most fearsome and captivating of all the extinct species, at least to the general public. To Newbins, wholl be applying this fall to undergraduate paleontology programs, finding the possible hand is unbelievably surrealkind of like a dream come true moment. As he will later say, echoing the sentiments of most in attendance at the gathering You know how everybody likes dinosaurs when theyre kids? I never stopped. The bone digger thumbs back the brim of his well seasoned Aussie bush hat. Theropods are rare, says Tyler Lyson, 34. Hes been prospecting these parts for fossils since he was young. He raises his eyebrows skeptically. I mean, very rare. Lyson is the founder of the MRF he is employed as a curator with the Denver Museum. A Yale trained paleontologist with a specialty in fossil vertebratesmore specifically dinosaurs and turtlesLyson pronounced Lee sun was born and raised here in Marmarth, population 143, a once thriving railroad town in the far southwest corner of North Dakota.

The Lonely Hedonist True Stories of Sex, Drugs, Dinosaurs and Peter Dinklage is Sagers sixth collection of true storiessixteen intimate profiles of larger than life Americans, both famous and obscure\r\n Lyson was just 16a year younger than Newbinswhen he spotted his first serious fossil, a mummified hadrosaur, or duck billed dinosaur, later nicknamed Dakota. An extraordinary find, Dakota had apparently died near the bend of a river, where its body was rapidly buried under accumulating sediment. The wet, mineral rich environment protected the specimen from decay, leaving a detailed preservation of the dinosaurs skin, bones and soft tissue. Eventually, the fees Lyson collected for loaning Dakota to a Japanese exposition would help him build out his foundations summer program, which he started as a college sophomore with four attendees in 2003. Dakota later found a permanent home at the North Dakota Heritage Center in Bismarck. Were there multiple bones? Lyson asks. Jeremy Wyman, 18, pulls out his cell phone, searches for a photo. It looked like multiple bones and multiple hand bones, he says. But then again his voice trails off. Lyson squints at the photo through his prescription aviator shades. With his scrubby beard and dirty, long sleeve shirt, he looks like a guy whos just spent the day hiking ten miles though the thorny, sage scented territory in the 90 degree heat. Ian said he\u00a0thought\u00a0it might be a hand, says Newbins, pleading his case. Ian is Ian Miller, their chaperone in the field today, a specialist in fossil plants who heads the paleontology department at the Denver Museum, making him Lysons boss. Miller is visiting this week, as he does annually. Later this evening, after a dinner of Chinese carryout from restaurant 20 miles away, across the Montana state line Miller will be giving a lecture about the Snowmastodon Project of 2010, when he helped to lead an effort to harvest an important site that had been found unexpectedly during the re construction of a reservoir in the resort town of Snowmass, Colorado. During the six month window they were allowed, the crew unearthed 4,826 bones from 26 different Ice Age vertebrates, including mammoths, mastodons, bisons, American camels, a Pleistocene horse and the first ground sloth ever found in Colorado. Lyson returns the phone to Wyman. I kind of wanna go look at it\u00a0right now, he says. I could go get my field stuff, Newbins says. If thats a theropod hand, Lyson says, Im gonna give you the biggest hug. Im gonna give\u00a0myself\u00a0a huge hug, Newbins says.  The bone digger is digging. Perched on a low shelf of rock at the bottom of a wash, Lyson scrapes gingerly with the three inch blade of a Swiss Army knife. Now and then he uses a small hand broom to wisk away the dust. He scrapes some more. The object of his attention is what appears to be a perfectly intact shell of an Axestemys, an extinct soft shelled turtle that grew to three and a half feet in diameter. A cousin of the large sacred turtles found in various temples in Asia, it was the largest animal in North America to survive the great extinction. You might say turtles were Lysons first paleontological love. Over time he has become one of the worlds foremost experts on turtle evolution. His latest work solves the mystery of how the turtle got its shell. Earlier in the day, a couple of dozen volunteers from the MRF walked right past the fossilized shell without seeing it. Then Lyson caught sight of ita brownish edge sticking out of the weathered ochre slope. Dropping his backpack on the spot, he got right to work. At 3,000 feet of elevation, the air is slightly thin the suns rays feel harsh against the skin. Prior to 65 million years ago, this part of the arid Badlands was at sea level. A moderately wet area, with lakes and streams, palms and ferns, it resembled the modern Gulf Coast. Today, along with the prickly pear cactus and desert grassesand the slippery sheets of gumbo collected in low areas like so many ponds of ice used by oil companies as a lubricant for oil drillingthe ground is a trove of minerals and fossils, bits and pieces of larger chunks that have weathered out of the sides of the buttes, evidence of the eternal cycle of erosion, and of the treasures buried all around. The group from the MRF is fanned out along the network of gullies and buttes within shouting distance of Lyson. By summers end, more than 100 will have passed through the program, including student teams from Yale University, Brooklyn College and the Smithsonian Institution. This weeks group includes a retired auditor who has traveled to 49 of the 50 states a retired science teacher credited with the 1997 find of an important\u00a0T. rex\u00a0named Pecks Rex a 23 year old whose grandfather employed Lyson, while still a teenager, to recover a triceratops and the mother of a young grad student who just wanted to see what her daughters chosen life is all about. One crew applies a plaster cast to a bone from a pterosaur, a flying reptile, a rare find. Another uses brushes, rock hammers and awls to unearth the jawbone and partial skull of a champsasaur, an alligator like animal with a thin snout. Up on top of a nearby butte, a third crew attends to a rich vein of fossil leaves. Another crew is equipped with a portable GPS system. Over the past two years, Lyson and his collaborators have hiked hundreds of miles in an attempt to create a computerized map of the KT Boundary. Known more formally as the CretaceousTertiary Boundary the German word\u00a0kreide, meaning chalk, is the traditional abbreviation for the Cretaceous Period, the KT Boundary is an iridium rich sedimentary layer that scientists believe marks in geologic time the catastrophic eventan asteroid colliding with the earththat led to the extinction of the dinosaurs and much of the earths fauna, paving the way for the evolution of mammals and modern plants. By placing all of the readings on a mapand by adding locations where fossils have been found including samples of leaves and pollen over a hundred year period by researchers from the Smithsonian, the Denver Museum, and other regional museumsLyson and the others have created a three dimensional image of the boundary that will aid in dating past and future finds. Simply put, if youre below the boundary, youre in the Cretaceous, the world of the dinosaurs. If youre above, youre in the Paleocene, the world of the mammals. Lyson and the others hope this data will help them more accurately depict the sequence of events of the great extinction. Did it happen all at once? Was it gradual? What was the timing across the globe? At the moment, Lyson has taken a break from mapping to do something hes had precious little time for this summercollecting a fossil. While the abundance of volunteers makes the painstaking tasks of digging and preparing fossils more efficienteverything taken will be donated eventually to public museumsit means that Lyson spends a lot more time administrating . . . and mapping. We are a few miles outside of Marmarth, founded in the early 1900s as a hub along a railroad line, leading from Chicago to Seattle, that was built to aid in settlement of the great northern plains. The town was named for the railroad owners grandaughter, Margaret Martha Finch. Despite a boom in the 1930s, caused by the discovery of oil nearby, the population has continued to dwindle from its high of 5,000. These days, locals say, a large percentage of Marmarth residents are retirees, here for the modest cost of living. There is one barrestaurant, a classic automobile museum, a coffee shoptobacco store, and a former railroad bunkhouse that rents out roomsduring summers it serves as the MRF dorm. The land where Lyson is digging is owned by his uncle Lysons maternal family, the Sonsallas, have ranched here for three generations. An important factor in fossil hunting is land ownership. Permission is needed to dig on both private and public lands, the latter managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. Lysons dad, Ranse, hails from a farming family in Montana. After a stint as a nuclear submariner, he worked as a D.J. at a small radio station in Baker, Montana, where he met the former Molly Sonsalla. The couple married and settled in Marmarth Ranse went to work for the oil company. The couple had three boys. The Hell Creek Formation was their playground. My mom would drop us off and wed run around and chase rabbits and look for fossils and arrowheads, Lyson says, scratch scratch scratching at the sand with his knife. I was the youngest. My older brothers would constantly beat me up, and I always gave them a run for their money. One of the guys wed go fishing with, his nickname was Beareverybody around here has nicknames. And one time he said to me, Youre gonna be tough when you grow up. I guess it stuck. Tuffy Lyson was in fourth or fifth grade when he came across his first important finda trove of giant turtle shells he named it the Turtle Graveyard. Likely they had died together as a pond dried up, he hypothesized. The next year he found his first hadrosaur. Dakota would come later, in high school. When hed finished unearthing it, Lyson remembers, he took a piece of the fossil in a shoebox down to the bunkhouseonly three blocks from his parents place  where all the commercial prospectors and academics would stay every summer while doing their field work. Id just hang around and I wouldnt leave until theyd take me out digging. You can imagine how annoying I was. They gave me a hard time but I was pretty resilient, Lyson says. From the spot where hes working on the turtle shell, the butte where he found his first hadrosaur is about one mile north. The locals call it Tuffy Butte. Look at the size of that thing, says Kirk Johnson, interrupting Lysons story. Johnson, 56, is a Yale trained paleobotanist and the director of the Smithsonian Institutions National Museum of Natural History. Hes been doing field work in Marmarth since he was an undergrad. He met Lyson when he was about 12, when Lyson was a little gumbo butte Sherpa, Johnson says. Lyson affectionately calls him Dr. J. Johnson was instrumental in helping to convince Lysons parentswho lived in a town where most of the sons went to work for the oil companythat their son could make an actual, paying career in paleontology. Eventually Lyson would go on to scholarships at Swarthmore and Yale. Hes that rarest of all rare things, a native paleontologist, Johnson says of Lyson. Hes remarkable in the field because hes trained his eye since he was small. He can see everything. \u00a0At least 25 people strolled right past it, and then I spotted it, Lyson says of his turtle shell find, pointing to the distinctive raindrop pattern of the markings on the surface of the shell. His face is alight with the glow of discoveryequal parts scientific interest and little boy hope.  The bone digger is standing on stage, beside a podium, wearing clean chinos and a button down oxford shirt We are 60 miles southwest of Marmarth, in the town of Ekalaka Eee ka laka, Montana. With a population of 300, its another close knit, Badlands ranching community, rich in fossils. The audience is a diverse collection, 200 academics, dinosaur enthusiasts, ranch owners, and community members who have gathered in the pews and folding chairs of the spacious sanctuary at the St. Elizabeth Lutheran Church to celebrate the fourth annual Ekalaka Shindig. Part small town fair, part open door conference, the Shindig is a weekend long celebration of Ekalakas contribution to paleontology, with a lecture program, kids activities, field expeditions and live music. Central to the entire program is the Carter County Museum, the first of its kind in Montana, founded in 1936. The museums guiding force was a local high school teacher named Marshall Lambert, who died in 2005 at the age of 90. He taught science to some of the old timers in the crowdas part of his curriculum, he took his students into the field to collect fossils. Today many of those students are landowners. Their cooperation is key. The Shindig lectures started at nine this morning. Right now its almost noon. As can be expectedbesides being hot and dusty, life is a little bit slower out here where some cell phones have no servicethings are running a bit late. Standing on the stage next to Lyson, getting ready to introduce him, is another bone digger. His name is Nate Carroll, but everybody calls him Ekalaka Jones. Carroll is 29 years old with a mop of black hair, wearing his trademark blue denim overalls. As the curator of the museum, the Ekalaka Shindig is his creation. Like Lyson, Carroll grew up with the Badlands as his playground his family goes back four generations. At 15, after a\u00a0T. rex\u00a0was unearthed 20 minutes away from his familys ranch, Carroll volunteered to work on the dig, sponsored by the LA County Museum. By his senior year in high school, hed landed a spot as a paid field assistant. Currently hes pursuing his Ph.D. at the University of Southern California. As an undergrad he focused on pterosaurs. Lately hes been more fascinated with amber. The secret to becoming a successful academic is finding a unique area of studyyoure not just out digging bones, youre trying to figure out a particular piece of historys puzzle. In 2012, Carroll decided to find a way to bring together all the different academics who come to the area to do fieldworkand to make it more attractive for others to come. The Shindig celebrates the community that supports the local museum, and the landowners who make fossil hunting possible. Last night was the annual Pitchfork Fondue, so named for the regulation, farmyard sized pitchforks upon which steaks by the dozen are skewered and then lowered into 50 gallon cauldrons of boiling peanut oil, to delicious result. As a band played country music and beer flowed from the taps, the assembled academics, students and locals danced and mingled and traded tall tales into the wee hours of the warm and buggy night. Early this morning, a caravan of sleepy MRF volunteers and staffers returned to Ekalaka to catch the day long slate of distinguished speakers, including Lyson and Kirk Johnson. In the audience, along with interested locals, are fieldworkers from, among others, the Burpee Museum of Rockford, Illinois, the Los Angeles County Museum, the University of California, Carthage College in Pennsylvania, and the University of Maryland. In the moments of fidgeting between presentations, one of the teens from the MRF group gets up from his chair and moves to the side of the sanctuary. I join Jeremy Wyman against the wall. He has his cell phone out per their MRF assignments, all four of the teen interns are live covering the Shindig on various social media platforms. By way of greeting, I ask him what hes up to. Resting my butt, he says with a respectful smirk. I ask about the theropod hand. What happened? Was it real? Wyman shrugs. It was nothing but plant matter, all crumbled up and packed together. We kind of jumped to a conclusion because it would be so\u00a0cool\u00a0to find a therapod hand. I ask if hes disappointed about the theropod hand. Wyman shakes his head emphatically,\u00a0no way. Being out here has actually changed my\u00a0entire\u00a0view on paleontology, he says. At first I was\u00a0super\u00a0into dinosaurs.

But this wasnt always the case. The groups dog sized ancestors actually had four toes on their front feet and three on their back. Why did they lose their digits? As\u00a0Nicola Davis at The Guardian reports, researchers may finally have an answer. In the study, published in the journal\u00a0The Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Harvard researchers used\u00a0micro CT scans to create detailed 3 D images of animal feet. They examined the long bones in the feet of 12\u00a0extinct horse species each from a different genus, as well as the bones from a tapir, a large pig like South American species with four toes on its front feet and three in the back.\u00a0 They then used that data to model how much stress those bones experience during\u00a0running and jumping. How did the center toe handle\u00a0the body weight? How did the side toes distribute the force? What they found is that the extra toes in early horse ancestors were necessary without the toes present to distribute the weight, the stress from running and jumping would be enough to fracture the big toe bone. As horses grew larger, however, the architecture of the big toe bone changed. As body mass increased, and side toes shrunk, the middle digit compensated by changing its internal geometry, allowing ever bigger horse species to eventually stand and move on one toe,\u00a0Harvard evolutionary biologist and co author Stephanie Pierce says in a press release. The bone of the digit carrying the load moved further from the center of the foot and grew thicker, helping it to resist\u00a0bending and breakage. This finding backs up to the latest theories on why horses grew larger\u00a0and lost their toes. As\u00a0Jen Viegas at Seeker reports, 55 million years ago the horses earliest ancestor was the dog sized genus Hyracotherium,\u00a0which roamed the forests of North America and had four front and three back toes for each limb. The creature lost a front toe due to natural selection, creating a hoof like claw that likely had a pad on the bottom. As the climate changed, opening vast grasslands in the region, early horses moved onto the plains, with selective pressure leading to a larger body mass. By about five million years ago, this shift led to the strengthening of the center toe and the loss of the outer\u00a0digits. This single toe likely helped the animals move faster and more efficiently, according to the lead\u00a0author of the study Brianna McHorse yes, that is her real name. It is very energetically expensive to have a bunch of toes on the end of that leg,\u00a0McHorse tells Davis. If you get rid of them then it costs less, energetically speaking, to swing that leg for every step. Robin Bendrey, a zooarchaeologist from the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study, supports the analysis. The study makes a major contribution to explaining a major evolutionary adaptative trend of the family Equidae and one which ultimately produced an animal that has been so influential in human history,\u00a0he tells Davis. Despite its usefulness for horses, having one toe is still evolutionarily unusual. Some species of a type of prehistoric animal that evolved in South America known as liptoterns also lost their digits and developed a horse like uni toe. But these creatures have long been extinct, leaving the horse and its ilk the only remaining one toed critters on Earth."}, {"title": "Is This Baby Animal the Last Common Ancestor of Humans and Apes?", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "August 10, 2017", "doc": "About 13 million years ago, when present day Kenya was covered in forests, a baby ape died. Its tiny corpse was covered in ash from a nearby volcano, helping to perfectly preserve its fragile cranium. Now, reports Michael Greshko at National Geographic, that baseball sized skull is giving researchers insight into a little understood period when the human and ape lineages split. As Greshko reports, between 25 to 28 million years ago, apes diverged from Old World monkeys before splitting into many different lineages. While most of those evolutionary branches died off about 7 million years ago as the climate changed, one line remained, later branching into great apes, like chimps,\u00a0gorillas and eventually humans. Reconstructing the history of that branch, however, has been difficult, mainly because the forests those common ancestors once lived\u00a0 werent great at preserving fossils. Researchers have found bits of jaw, facial bones and foreheads, but a complete cranium is an almost miraculous find. During an expedition three years ago, Kenyan fossil hunter John Ekusi\u00a0discovered the infant skull\u00a0in the Turkana Basin of northern Kenya, reports Michael Price at\u00a0Science. Dating suggests that the skull was some 13 million years old and dental rings showed the creature\u00a0was just one\u00a0year, four months old when it perished. The shape of the teeth also showed it was a new species in\u00a0the genus Nyanzapithecus, given a species designation of\u00a0alesi. The research appears in the journal Nature. As\u00a0George Dvorsky at Gizmodo reports,\u00a0the researchers believe N.\u00a0alesi is the oldest common ancestor of human and apes discovered so far. If the animal was fully grown it would have weighed in at 25 pounds and\u00a0looked like a gibbon. But a tiny semicircular canal in the skull suggests was markedly different from gibbons, reports Dvorsky. In tree dwelling primates, like gibbons, the canal is larger and helps the animals keep their balance and orientation as they swing through the trees. So\u00a0N.\u00a0alesi was likely a slower moving primate. Gibbons are well known for their fast and acrobatic behavior in trees, co author Fred Spoor of University College London and the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology says in a press release. But the inner ears of N.\u00a0alesi show that it would have had a much more cautious way of moving around. Brenda Benefit, an anthropologist at New Mexico State University, who was not involved in the study, tells Dvorsky that N. alesi\u00a0combines some traits of the great apes with more primitive gibbon like traits. But the inner ear helps researchers know that fossil comes from a period after monkeys and early apes diverged. According to Price at Science, placing N. alesi in the ape ancestor camp helps answer a big question in paleontology whether the common ancestor of hominins and apes evolved in Africa or somewhere in Eurasia. Determining this last common ancestor of apes and humans is also important in figuring out\u00a0what pressures, such as climate, geography and ecology, led to the emergence of early human ancestors, reports\u00a0Charles Q.\u00a0Choi\u00a0at\u00a0LiveScience,\u00a0 The living apes are found all across Africa and Asiachimps and gorillas in Africa, orangutans and gibbons in Asiaand there are many fossil apes found on both continents, and Europe as well, Christopher Gilbert, paleoanthropologist at Hunter College in New York and co author of the paper, tells Choi. So, as you can imagine, there are numerous possibilities for how that distribution came to be, and different researchers have suggested different hypotheses for where the common ancestor of the living apes and humans might be found. The discovery of N.\u00a0alesi\u00a0seems to squarely place that lineage in Kenya. But not everyone is convinced by the little skull. For one, David Begun, anthropologist at the University of Toronto in Canada argues that human and ape ancestors evolved in Europe before moving into Africa. He tells Dvorsky that he believes other ape specimens, including Proconsul and Ekembo are also good candidates for being the last common ancestor. In fact, he points out that paleontologists previously found a 17 million year old specimen of Nyanzapithecus. It therefore does not mean that the last common ancestor of all living apes lived 13 million years ago, the age of this fossil, he says. It was much older than that. Theres just one solution find more skulls.\u00a0And, as Greshko reports, the researchers saw hints that more fossils may be trapped in the ash layer. They hope to soon return\u00a0to look for more."}, {"title": "Exceptional Fossils Show Ancient Winged Mammals May Have Glided Above the Dinosaurs", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "August 10, 2017", "doc": "Gliding mammals, like flying squirrels, sugar gliders and colugos are pretty impressive creatures, with some capable of flying up to 300 feet in a single jump between trees. While gliding might seem like a novelty among modern mammals, as\u00a0Shaena Montanari at National Geographic reports, two new fossils found in China suggest that the mammalian ancestors likely figured out how to glide during the age of the dinosaurs, 160 million years ago. The two well preserved fossils were discovered in the Tiaojishan Formation in Hebei Province, China in sediments from an ancient lake. As\u00a0Montanari reports, the fossils include well preserved bones and teeth as well as imprints of the skin flaps the creatures used to glide. The research was published this week in two papers in the journal Nature. One specimen, Maiopatagium furculiferum,\u00a0was about the size of a squirrel and had simple teeth like modern species that gnaw on soft fruit. The other species, Vilevolodon diplomyos, was closer in size to a mouse and had ridged molars, similar to modern seed eating species, though, according to a press release, both species lived at a time before the dawn of flowering plants and likely specialized in eating parts of the ferns, conifers and gingkoes that dominated the Jurassic. Ten other gliding mammals from the Jurassic era have been previously found in recent years, suggesting that the strategy of gliding and the ecological niches it opened up was well established during the period. However, these two new specimens are the oldest gliders discovered so far. As\u00a0Carl Zimmer at The New York Times reports,\u00a0in the past, paleontologists believed that proto mammals during the Mesozoic Era which lasted 252 to 66 million years ago were not very diverse.\u00a0 Most, they thought, were little nocturnal insect eaters scurrying around after the dinosaurs went to bed. But in the last decade, researchers have found thats not true. Besides the gliding animals theyve also discovered a range of species, Zimmer reports. There were otter like swimmers, raccoon like critters that predated on eggs, and even aardvark like creatures that chowed down on\u00a0insect nests. We consistently find with every new fossil that the earliest mammals were just as diverse in both feeding and locomotor adaptations as modern mammals, Luo says in\u00a0a press release. The groundwork for mammalian success today appears to have been laid long ago. Both of the new gliders are haramiyidans, which are an extinct branch of pre mammals. As Zimmer reports, in many ways they are very different from mammals of today. They likely laid eggs and did not have the unique bones mammals use to hear. At the same time they look similar to the furry, warm blooded gliders we have today. I was stunned when first seeing these specimens  they looked as if they just fell flat into a shallow lake, with limbs and their gliding membranes spread perfectly out, fossilized for eternity, Luo tells\u00a0Laura Geggel at\u00a0LiveScience. They are almost like modern mammal gliders The ancient gliders died out well before the dawn of modern mammals. According to the press release, the fossils are a great example of convergent evolution, in which unrelated species develop similar evolutionary strategies. Two branches of modern mammals developed gliding at least 100 million years later, leading to todays marsupial sugar gliders and flying squirrels."}, {"title": "New Analysis Indicates Early Britons Engaged in Ritualistic Cannibalism", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "August 10, 2017", "doc": "In the 1980s, researchers exploring the Cheddar Gorge in Somerset, England, found something incredible inside Goughs Cave. No, it wasnt a delicious wheel of ancient cheese it was the remains of a three year old, two adolescents and at least two adults that appeared to have been eaten by humans some 15,000 years ago. Now, Hannah Devlin at The Guardian reports a study of engravings on the bones suggest they may have been butchered as part of a ritual. According to Devlin, researchers werent sure why the ancient Britons ate their companions. Some suggested it was part of a sacred rite while others thought it might have been a desperate act of starving people. About 40 percent of the human bones found in the cave have bite marks on them, while 60 percent show some\u00a0signs of butchery activities. Steph Yin at The New York Times reports that after taking a closer look at some of the marks on a bone from a right forearm, the researchers found that they were much deeper and wider than the butchering cuts, and also made a zigzag pattern. That, along with\u00a0skulls that appear to have been fashioned into drinking cups which were previously discovered at the site, indicates that cannibalism was part of ritual. Its likely that ritual wasnt actually violent. Jen Viegas at Seeker explains that none of the bones recovered showed signs of injury, meaning the practice could have been part of funeral rite\u00a0known as endocannibalism. None of the remains seem to reveal any obvious signs of trauma, Silvia Bello, lead author of the study in the journal PLOS One tells Viegas. Suggesting that the consumed probably died of natural causes rather than a violent death. If this is the case, it is probable that the consumers and the consumed belonged to the same group. In fact, Bello tells Hannah Osborne at Newsweek that after eating the flesh, the living paused to ritually engrave the bones before cracking them open to eat the marrow. While its currently impossible to figure out the motive for such cannibalism, Bello says that eating a loved one might have been a way to try and transfer their knowledge or extend the memory of them. Thats not to say eating the bodies was just for show. Devlin reports that while the skulls did not show many bite marks, the toe and finger bones found were pretty chewed up, indicating that the cannibals were at least a little hungry. There are not signs that the bones were ever cooked over a fire, so its likely they were either consumed raw or boiled. Its something that we find horrifying, but  that was their tradition, Bello tells Devlin. Like we incinerate bodies or put them in the ground. It was their way of disposing of bodies, like it or not. Osborne reports that similar zigzag cut marks have been found on animal bones and tools in France and cannibalism has been found in other parts of Europe. The team plans continue research into cannibalism rituals. They also hope to extract DNA from the Gough bones to try and establish if the people living there were related to other prehistoric groups in Europe."}, {"title": "Did Scientists Just Unveil the Biggest Dinosaur of All Time?", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "August 9, 2017", "doc": "Dinosaurs are superlative animals in every sense of the word.\u00a0Their ranks include some of the strangest and fiercest creatures ever to have evolved, not to mention the largest\u00a0to have walked the Earth. Now paleontologists have announced a species proposed to be most massive dinosaur ever discovered an enormous herbivore estimated at over 120 feet long and weighing over 70 tonsor longer than a blue whale and heavier than a dozen African elephants. You may have already heard of this ancient titan. The dino started making headlines back in 2014, before its\u00a0bones were even fully out of the ground, getting its own David Attenborough hosted documentary and American Museum of Natural History exhibit in early 2016. Over and over again, the Cretaceous dinosaurs status as the biggest of all time was proclaimed. But the dinosaur didnt have a name it was simply referred to as The Titanosaur and no formal description of the bones was published for other experts to check this sauropods claim for the title.\u00a0 Today, in the pages of the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, paleontologist Jos\u00e9 Carballido of the Museo Paleontol\u00f3gico Egidio Feruglio and colleagues have finally published the scientific details of this enormous plant muncher. The dinosaurs official name is Patagotitan mayorum, meaning\u00a0the Mayo familys Patagonian titan. Thats because its bones were excavated in 2014 at La Flecha ranch, owned by the Mayos, in Chubut Province, Argentina, from their 101 million year old resting place. This wasnt the resting place of just one animal. The stone was littered with the remains of at least six individual dinosaurs of different ages and sizes. By the time they were done, however, the paleontologists had excavated parts of the neck, back, tail and limbs, which were enough to come to two conclusions This was a dinosaur no one had ever seen before, and it was a true giant. \u00a0 But was it really the largest dinosaur of all time, as some of the media hype has proclaimed?\u00a0 Not everyone is convinced. Mathew Wedel, a paleontologist at the Western University of Health Sciences who has been following the titanosaurs story since 2014, notes that the body of the new paper doesnt include the necessary measurements of the dinosaurs bones to tell. On top of that, Wedel says, the measurements reported in the media so far hint that Patagotitan was comparable in size to the previous record holder, Argentinosaurus, also known from Cretaceous Argentina.\u00a0 So not the worlds largest sauropod, probably, Wedel says, but the most complete super giant sauropod by far. This means Patagotitan joins a club of previously discovered immense dinosaurs its real claim to fame\u00a0is that far more bones of\u00a0Patagotitan\u00a0are known than for other giants.\u00a0I think it would be more accurate to say that Argentinosaurus, Puertasaurus and Patagotitan are so similar in size that it is impossible for now to say which one was the largest, Wedel says.\u00a0 But step back from the my dinosaur is bigger than yours contest for a moment, and a curious pattern starts to appear. All the big sauropods for which we have good evidence seem to be clustering in the same general area, Wedel says, whether those are titanosaurs or other sauropod giants from different lineages. That suggests a real upper limit that all these lineages were hitting, Wedel says, with Patagotitan not so much blowing past previous records as reinforcing an emerging pattern. Which brings us to the question of why these dinosaurs got so large at all. Macalester College paleontologist Kristi Curry Rogers points out that these huge sauropods were bellwethers of the times they lived in. Titanosaurs like Patagotitan evolved huge bodies because they could, Curry Rogers says, adding that the ecosystems they inhabited had the resources to support their bodies, and their unique and specialized physiological adaptations made behemoth sizes work for them. \u00a0Furthermore, Wedel says, a giant like Patagotitan is a case of them that has, gets.\u00a0 Living large has definite benefits. Big sauropods, Wedel says, laid more eggs, were harder for predators to kill, could survive on lower quality food, could migrate long distances on less resources, and more. The bigger they got, the more benefits they reaped So to me the mystery is not Why did some sauropods get so big? its Why didnt all sauropods gets big at Argentinosaurus, Puretasaurus and Patagotitan? Sauropods came in sizes from about as large as a draft horse to the biggest animals on land. What led to that range of sizes is still unclear.\u00a0 Yet for better or worse, its the giants who transfix our attention, and it seems that every few years theres another dinosaur thats touted as the largest of all time. Brachiosaurus, Supersaurus, Seismosaurus, Argentinosaurus\u00a0and more have all had their turn laying claim to the title over the years.\u00a0 Could there still be larger dinosaurs out there? Curry Rogers thinks so. So far, all of the very biggest sauropod dinosaurs how clear signs that they are still growing when they died, Curry Rogers says. Even the largest Patagotitan bones, she points out, show signs of ongoing growth at death. Even if weve discovered the largest terrestrial animals ever known, Curry Rogers says, we havent found the biggest representatives of their species so far. So rest assured, paleo lovers There are still giant discoveries to be made."}, {"title": "Was the \u201cSleeping Dragon\u201d Dinosaur a Red Head?", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "August 4, 2017", "doc": "In May, the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Alberta debuted a stunning fossil, a life like mummy of a 110 million year old armored nodosaur that some people dubbed the sleeping dragon. The creature\u00a0is preserved in stunning detailfrom its stomach contents to its plate like armor. In addition to these features, a thin organic film covered parts of its body, reports Nicola Davis at The Guardian. Now scientists have analyzed that film\u00a0and made a surprising discovery The dinosaur likely sported a reddish coloring on\u00a0top.\u00a0They published their results\u00a0in the journal\u00a0Current Biology. Its believed that after the\u00a0dino\u00a0died, it fell back first into the muddy floor of the ocean. That perfectly preserved the top half of the creature. The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous. You dont need to use much imagination to reconstruct it if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping, Donald Henderson, Curator of Dinosaurs at the Royal Tyrell Museum says in a press release. It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimensthe Mona Lisa of dinosaurs. Discovered by accident in 2011, scientists have since been working to analyze the creature, teasing out details about its physical looks and life. As Davis reports, scientists discovered that the black film contained traces of elements that are associated with red pigmentation. We could see that the organic compounds in the film were something that contained carbon, nitrogen and sulfurthat is something that we know is typical for the pigment red melanin, University of Bristol molecular paleobiologist Jakob Vinther tells Davis. The film was only found on the top of the nodosaur, which suggests that it was red on top and\u00a0pale on its undersidea color pattering known as countershading\u00a0in which the critters top and bottom halves are different colors. This flattens the animals appearance at a distance, making it harder for predators to spot.\u00a0While modern prey species like deer and chipmunks are\u00a0countershaded, heavily armored species such as rhinos or predators such as brown bears dont generally sport this useful camouflage pattern. As Davis reports, if this tank like plant eaterwho likely weighed in at nearly 3,000 pounds and measured up to 18 feet long in lifeneeded counter shading to hide from hungry carnivores, this conflicts with the common idea that large dinosaurs like\u00a0T. rex\u00a0were primarily scavengers. That this nodosaur is camouflaged means that it still was experiencing predation regularlythese animals got gobbled up and eaten by the large theropod dinosaurs, Vinther tells Davis. Things were scary back then. Not everyone is convinced that the\u00a0nodosaur\u00a0sported this red colorationor what the coloring could imply about its life history. Alison Moyer who studies fossilized tissue at Drexel University tells\u00a0Michael Greshko at\u00a0National Geographic\u00a0that the organic film found on the sleeping dragon could have come from bacteria that grew on the decaying corpse after death.\u00a0She also notes that the preserved dinosaur hide doesnt reach the animals belly, meaning the underside could have been the same color.\u00a0 Even if the creature was two toned, Moyer cautions against drawing too many conclusions based on these looks. The study relating to the pigmentation and colorationand, therefore, conclusions about predator prey relationshipsis kind of flooded with issues, Moyer tells\u00a0Greshko. There are endless possibilities that arent considered that would be more parsimonious than jumping to this countershading. Whatever color the nodosaur was, its still extraordinary, and the study serves as the species debut in the scientific literature. According to\u00a0a press release, the creature now officially represents a new genus and species of dinosaur,\u00a0Borealopelta markmitchelli,\u00a0named after Mark Mitchell, the museum technician who spent five and a half years meticulously removing rock from the specimen after it was found in 2011 in Albertas Suncor Millennium Mine.

", "author": "Lorraine Boissoneault", "date": "July 31, 2017", "doc": "Turn the clock back 1.8 million years, and the world was full of fantastic\u00a0beasts In North America, lions, dire wolves and giant sloths prowled the land. South America boasted camel like creatures and giant 4,500 pound bears. Eurasia had rhinoceroses and cave hyenas, while Australia teemed with giant wombats and 7 foot tall flightless birds. Across all those continents and many islands were massive, long nosed creatures that included the notorious woolly mammoths and mastodons. Today we have less than half of the species known as megafaunaan exclusive club whose members weigh at least 97 pounds when fully grownon all continents but Africa. Where did these giants all go? In the past 50 years, archaeologists have started to come to a damning conclusion Perhaps they would still be here if humans hadnt arrived on the scene. First proposed in 1966 by paleontologist Paul Martin, this overkill hypothesis stated that the arrival of modern humans in each new part of the world brought with it the extinction of all those huge animals, whether through hunting them or outcompeting them. The hypothesis paints humans as a potent force of destruction and was highly controversial when Martin first proposed it. But over time it gained tractionthough never full consensusin the archaeological community. Today, some archaeologists continue to fight back. For many of these Pleistocene extinctions, humans probably arent to blame, says archaeologist Ben Marwick. The key to his argument is timing Marwick and other researchers recently found human artifacts in the Madjedbebe rock shelter in northern Australian that indicate humans came to the island 65,000 years ago, 10,000 years earlier than previously believed. Thats critical, because Australian megafauna didnt start going extinct until sometime between 60,000 and 40,000 years ago. The new data puts people on the landscape well before megafauna started suffering population stress and showing signs of extinction, Markwick says. Its like the alibi for humans It absolves them of central responsibility. Marwick believes his teams find in Australia may be close to a deathblow for the hypothesis. In archaeology we rarely have such decisive finds that shift the argument from an ongoing debate to a fact, but my feeling is that this could be one of those moments, he says. Indeed, recent finds have threatened to upend the conventional timeline of human migration. Marwick pointed to a controversial study from April that suggests humans arrived in North America 100,000 years earlier than previously believed. It looks as if the whole global debate of megafauna extinction is getting a simultaneous revision, he says. If thats true, the consequences would go beyond the scientific. If it turns out we didnt kill the megafauna, says Marwick, that might suggest our relationship is more one of being just another species on the landscape, rather than a total domination and inflicting environmental violence. But for two scientists, the same data can tell vastly different stories. Geologist and paleontologist Gifford Miller of University of Colorado at Boulder thinks Marwicks study proves the exact opposite of what Marwick claims. One of the previous arguments against a human role in the Australian megafaunal extinction was that humans first appeared there 50,000 years ago and animals were gone almost immediately after, which doesnt given them enough time to build a population size sufficient to have any kind of impact, he says. Marwicks data, he says, helps solve this discrepancy. The earlier arrival date gives humans time to grow in number over generations, spreading across the landscape, eating whatever they came across and transforming the environment. Its undeniable that humans are preying on some of these large animals, says Miller, and undeniably something happens to the ecosystem structure and function at about the same time. Miller knows the signs of human hunting better than most. He has spent years studying the burnt remains of eggs laid by Australian thunder birds Genyornis newtoni, giant flightless avians that went extinct approximately 47,000 years ago. In 2015 Miller and others published a paper in Nature Communications arguing the burn patterns on these eggshells, which have been found in more than 200 hearth sites across Australia, were different than what would be seen from natural wildfires. You cant make a firm statement, but I think the smart money is the megafauna would still be around if humans hadnt arrived, he says. One counterargument to the overkill hypothesis is that ancient climate change killed off all those huge beasts. Scientists on this side of the fence argue that, depending on the continent, fluctuations in temperature and humidity spelled doom for the megafauna. Yet Miller, who has also studied climate change in Australia from the Quaternary period beginning 2.5 million years ago to today, finds that argument lacking. These are animals that have been living through the Quaternary, and its a rough time. In Australia, you go from extreme cold and dry during Ice Age periods and warmer and wetter conditions in interglacial times. And theyve made it through 20 of these cycles. Archaeologist Todd Surovell tends to agree with Millers assessment, though he didnt always. Surovell was a student under Martin, the father of the overkill hypothesis. Initially,\u00a0he was skeptical. The biggest hang up is the paucity of physical evidence. For me that was the case for a long time, Surovell says. But when he started studying megafaunal extinction on a global scale, not just in North America, the patterns he saw astounded him. Hunting these large mammals tracks global colonization perfectly, he says. Humans move to a new place, megafauna suffer extinction. Of course, the ecological and archaeological landscapes are vastly different between Australia and North America, where Surovell does most of his research. In Australia, theres relatively little evidence of humans hunting or eating megafauna other than the eggshells Miller studied scientists have found no definitive proof that humans caused the doom of dozens of other deceased species, including 25 foot long lizards and 1,000 pound kangaroos. But in North America, there are dozens of sites that show human exploitation of mammoths for their meat and tusks, though those sites can sometimes be contentious in their own right. There are more than 70 mammoths that have been argued to have some cultural association human markings or evidence of butchery, Surovell says. Of those, the archaeological community would accept 16 as definite. Some argue that just because a spearhead was found in the same location as a mammoth, it doesnt mean humans killed it they couldve just been scavenging its meat. And then theres the fact that plenty of other speciesfrom short faced bears to Glyptodons, which were essentially 1 ton armadillosbut we have no evidence of humans hunting them. That means humans didnt play any role in driving these other giants extinct, Surovell clarifies. I dont know anything about hunting ground sloths, but I imagine a 16 year old kid with a spear coming across one, is he going to ignore that? No, he speculates.\u00a0 While hes considered the impacts of large carnivores like lions and saber toothed cats, Surovell believes that the pressure humans put on the landscape forced those apex hunters to extinction. After all, humans arent just hunters were ecosystem shapers. By changing the landscape and driving out predators, we may have had a far larger impact than even the deadliest non human predators. For Miller, all the evidence of humankinds ability to alter ecosystems provides irrefutable evidence of the overkill hypothesis. But that doesnt mean the debate is anywhere near settled. Like climate change or human evolution, Miller says, the debate over whether humans are responsible for extinctions can\u00a0be about values just as much as it is about data. Im not sure theres any evidence that will convince people who dont want humans to be responsible for such a big change, Miller says. They want to put it in terms of good and bad. Theres nothing to do with good and bad. Its not that humans set out to exterminate things. Theyre trying to feed their families the most efficient way they can. The idea that ancient hunter gatherers dramatically altered their ecosystems doesnt necessarily line up with the stereotypes people have, Surovell addswhich is all the more reason to find evidence for the hypothesis. People like to think we dont see major human environmental impacts until the Neolithic, with farming, but I think thats absolutely not the case, he says. We see it from the very beginning of human existence on the planet. I think it speaks to our nature as animals, as ecological agents, as shapers of the environment. What all of them agree on is that the debate is far from being over, and people will continue hunting for evidence to prove and disprove the overkill hypothesis. Surovell believes it would take faunal evidence from a dozen early North American human sites to really solidify the hypothesis among North American archaeologists. But he does say this The best way to falsify overkill is to show animals went extinct before human arrival. For 50 years now weve been trying to falsify overkill and weve failed. That, to me, suggests its a pretty strong hypothesis."}, {"title": "The Fierce T. Rex Was a Walker Not a Sprinter", "author": "Ben Panko", "date": "July 18, 2017", "doc": "A heart pounding scene of the hit film Jurassic Park depicts a fearsome Tyrannosaurus Rex chasing\u00a0scientists in a Jeep\u00a0and nearly catching them. But in reality, the infamous T. rex would have broken its legs trying to move anywhere near that fast, new research suggests. The muscles need to be able to generate sufficient power to allow high speed locomotion, but at the same time the skeleton has to be able to cope with the loads generated by the high speed, paleontologist William Sellers tells\u00a0Matthew Stock at Reuters. Sellers and his collaborators used advanced computer simulations to model how the seven\u00a0tons of weight of an adult T. rex would be distributed as it moved, reports Tom Chivers for Buzzfeed News. While its skeleton was capable of running motions, the scientists found that\u00a0beasts slender legs likely wouldve shattered under stress of its entire body weight landing on one leg.\u00a0 Instead, it appears that the most an adult T. rex would have been capable of would have been a walking pacebut its long legs would have made it a pretty fast walk by human standards. At top speed, the dinosaur would be able to move at around 12 miles per hour, reports George Dvorsky for Gizmodo. This\u00a0is within the range of\u00a0average sprinting speeds for most people, but less than the half the top speed ever clocked by a person.\u00a0They published their results in the journal\u00a0PeerJ. It certainly would not have been able to chase down faster moving prey animals, Sellers tells Stock, raising the possibility that the previously discredited hypothesis of the T. rex being more of a scavenger could hold some water. However, even at relatively slow speeds, there wouldve still been plenty of prey available to the T. rex, paleontologist Thomas Carr tells Dvorsky. It doesnt matter if adult T. rex couldnt run all it had to do was move more quickly than its prey, Carr tells Dvorsky. The available herbivorous dinosaurs in its environmentEdmontosaurus, Triceratops, Ankylosauruswere all much slower than an adult T. rex it was just slaughter in the slow lane. The T. rex could have also relied on the element of surprise in its heavily forested habitats by being able to ambush and quickly subdue prey, according to Buzzfeed News. Like kids who can run laps around their parents, smaller, lighter juvenile T. rex would have likely been able to move much faster, reports Buzzfeed News, possibly letting them pursue more agile prey while leaving the slower, larger animals to their older relatives. So if you expect to encounter any T. rex on your island explorations, you might want to bring along a pair of running shoes. You might just be able to outrun it."}, {"title": "Will the Public Ever Get to See the \u201cDueling Dinosaurs\u201d?", "author": "Mike Sager", "date": "July 2017", "doc": "The Dinosaur Cowboy sits behind an old desk in the dusty basement workshop of the ranch house where he grew up, wearing a denim shirt and blue jeans, his thinnish brown hair bearing the impression of his black Stetson, which hes left upstairs in the mudroom, along with his boots. Behind him, peering down over his shoulder from its perch atop an antique safe, is the fearsome, dragon like head of a horned Stygimoloch, a replica of an important fossil he once found. The way it is mounted, jaws agape, it appears to be smiling, captured in a moment of prehistoric mirth. \n        Hell Creek, Montana Americas Key to the Prehistoric Past\n     The Dinosaur Cowboy is smiling, too. You could probably say its an ironic smile, or a little bit of a grimace. His real name is Clayton Phipps. A wiry 44 year old with a weathered yet impish face, he lives on the ranch with his wife, two sons, a few horses and 80 cows in the unincorporated community of Brusett, Montana. Located in the far north of the state, near the rim of the Missouri River Breaks, it is all but impassable during winter the closest shopping mall is 180 miles southwest, in Billings. Of his spread, Phipps likes to say Its big enough to not starve to death on. Phipps is the great grandson of homesteaderspioneers who were given the right to claim, improve and buy land at bargain prices. Most became cattle ranchers, the only logical choice in this unforgiving region. Little did they know the land theyd claimed was sitting atop the Hell Creek Formation, a 300 foot thick bed of sandstone and mudstone that dates to a period between 66 million and 67.5 million years ago, the time just before dinosaurs went extinct. Stretching across the Dakotas and Montana in Wyoming, its known as Lance, the formationone of the richest fossil troves in the worldis the remnant of great rivers that once flowed eastward toward an inland sea. Before his father died, and the homestead was divided among four descendant families, including Phipps and his two siblings, Phipps scraped by as a ranch hand on a neighboring ranch. He and his wife, Lisa, a teachers aide at the local school, lived in a cabin on the ranchers property. One day in 1998, Phipps says, a man showed up and asked the landowners permission to hunt fossils. Given consent to roam the property for a weekend, the man returned Monday morning and showed Phipps a piece of triceratops frillpart of the shield like structure that grew around the massive plant eaters head. He told me This piece is worth about 500, Phipps recalls. And I was like, The heck it is You found that just walking around? From that day on, whenever Phipps wasnt doing ranch work, he was out looking for fossils. What he found he prepared in his basement workshop, or consigned to others to prepare, for sale at trade shows and to museums and private collectors. In 2003, he unearthed the head of the horned Stygimolochfrom the Greek and Hebrew, roughly, for demon from the river Styxa bipedal dinosaur, about the size of a bighorn sheep, prized by collectors for its highly ornamented skull. Phipps sold the fossil for more than 100,000 to a private collector, who placed the specimen in a museum in Long Island, New York. Then, one hot day in 2006, Phipps and some partners made the discovery of a lifetimeexperts say it might well be one of the greatest fossil specimens ever unearthed. Or, more accurately, two specimens. Jutting out from a desiccated hillside were the remains of a 22 foot long theropod and a 28 foot long ceratopsian. Locked in mortal combat when they were instantly buried in sandstone, perhaps along a sandy riverbed, the incredibly well preserved pair is forever captured in a moment in time from more than 66 million years ago. Theres an entire skin envelope around both dinosaurs, Phipps says. Theyre basically mummies. There could be soft tissue inside. If true, the specimen offers the possibility that scientists might recover tissue cells or even ancient DNA. The exact species of the Montana Dueling Dinosaurs, as the specimens have become known, are still in contention. The larger of the two appears to be a ceratopsian, from the family of beaked and bird hipped plant eaters beloved by children for their horned faces. The existence of additional horns on the animals faceplate, however, has led to some speculation that it may be a rare or new species. The smaller specimen appears to be either a juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex or a Nanotyrannus, a dwarf species, rarely documented, the very existence of which some scientists dispute. Scott Sampson, a paleontologist and the president of Science World, a nonprofit education and research facility in Vancouver, is among the few academics, museum officials and commercial collectors who have viewed the specimen. The Dueling Dinosaurs is one of the most remarkable fossil discoveries ever made, he says. It is the closest thing I have ever seen to large scale fighting dinosaurs. If it is what we think it is, its ancient behavior caught in the fossil record. Weve been digging for over 100 years in the Americas, and no ones found a specimen quite like this one. And yet there is a chance the public will never see it.  We may speculate romantically about how far into the past dinosaur fossils were collected by our hominin ancestors, but the study of dinosaurs is a relatively new science. Deep thinkers in ancient Greece and Rome recognized fossils as the remains of life forms from earlier epochs. Leonardo da Vinci proposed that fossils of marine creatures like mollusks found in the Italian countryside must have been evidence of ancient seas that once covered the land. But for the most part, fossils were regarded as the remains of gods or devils. Many believed they had special powers of healing or destruction others that they were left behind from Noahs flood, a notion still held by creationists, who deny evolution. Dinosaurs inhabited much of the earth, but their fossils are not easily found in most places. The western United States is a treasure trove due to a combination of factors We live during a sweet spot in time when the rock layers laid down during the end of the Cretaceous Period have become exposed after eons of erosion, a process accentuated by the stark environment, lack of plant life and extreme weather conditions that continually reveal ever new layers of ancient rock. As layers of the earths surface erode, fossilized bones of dinosaurs, more solid than the sand and clay in which they are buried, peek through. In the early 20th century, universities and museums frequently commissioned commercial bone diggers to excavate dinosaur fossils. Many of the oldest specimens on display in museums in the United States and Europe were uncovered and harvested by these professional amateurs. While federal land can only be prospected by accredited academics in possession of a permit, dinosaur bones found on private land are private property Anybody can dig with the permission of the owner. In 1990, a group of paleontologists digging on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation, in South Dakota, unearthed an enormous and incredibly well preserved\u00a0T. rex. Later named Sue, it is to date the largest and most complete specimen ever found, with more than 90 percent of its bones recovered. Sue was auctioned in 1997 for 7.6 million to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the most ever paid for a dinosaur fossil. The record sale was publicized around the world and kicked off a sort of dinosaur bone gold rush. Scores of prospectors descended on Hell Creek and other fossil beds in the West, drawing the ire of academics, who contend that fossils should be extracted according to scientific protocols, not ripped from the ground by profit seeking amateurs. To scientists, every site contains much more than fossil trophiesthe plant, pollen and mineral records, as well as the exact placement of the find, are critically important to understanding the history of our planet.\u2029Over the following decade, the mania for dinosaur bones was fueled by the popularity of movies like\u00a0Jurassic Park, booming wealth in Asia, where fossils became ultra chic for use in home d\u00e9cor, and the medias attention to celebrity collectors like Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicolas Cage. At the height of the bone rush, there were perhaps hundreds of prospectors conducting digs across hundreds of thousands of square miles, ranging from the Dakotas to Texas. One of them was Cowboy Phipps.  It was a typical day in early June, clear with the mercury in the triple digits, when Phipps discovered the Dueling Dinosaurs. He was prospecting with his cousin Chad OConnor, 49, and a friend and fellow commercial bone digger named Mark Eatman, 45. OConnor, strong and good humored, is partially disabled by cerebral palsy. This was his first time hunting for dinosaur bones. Hed later say he accompanied his cousin on the expedition in the hope hed find something that could change my life. Eatman had been a full time prospector for many years before falling demand and prices for fossils, along with a three year stretch of bad luck, forced him to give up the game. His wife told him it was time to get a real job, Phipps says. Eatman found work selling carpet in Billings. On occasion hed join Phipps for an expedition, sometimes camping out for a few days at a time. Bone diggers across the spectrumcommercial, academic, amateurwould probably agree that the hunt is often as important as the find, an opportunity to get out into nature and to collaborate with like minded people beneath the same ancient stars the dinosaurs stood under. Phipps and his partners were checking out an area about 60 miles north of Phipps ranch. Because he was using a small map of a big area, Phipps says, he believed they were on land his brother was leasing, in the Judith River Formation, which predates Hell Creek by at least ten million years. Later, Phipps discovered they were actually prospecting about ten miles north of where he thought they were, in the area that Phipps, like most of the locals, calls\u00a0Hell Crik. The land was part of a 25,000 acre ranch owned by Mary Ann and Lige Murray. The men picked their way through the sunburnt environment, the ground a mix of eroded clay, shale and sand. The topography is riven with canyons, ravines and gullies, interrupted by striated buttes, hunkered beneath the cloudless sky like silent messengers from the past. In the time of the dinosaurs, the Hell Creek area was subtropical, with a warm and humid climate. The swampy lowlands were rich with flowering plants, palmettos and ferns. At higher elevations were forests of shrubs and a variety of broad leaved trees and conifers. About 66 million years ago, an asteroid collided with the earth, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs and much of the earths fauna and paving the way for the evolution of mammals and modern plants. Today, Hell Creek is stark, hot and seemingly deserted. The crew made its way around low growing cactuses, through prickly and fragrant sage, over tuffs of wild grasses. Phipps was riding a small, off road motorcycle. The other two men were on foot. Along the way they encountered an occasional set of sun bleached bones, late of a grazing cow or other denizen prairie dog, mule deer, antelope, coyote. At about 11 a.m. Eatman spotted what looked like a piece of massive bone sticking out of a sandstone bank. Phipps approached the hillside for closer inspection. Right away, he says, We knew we had a pelvis, possibly of a ceratopsian. And we knew we had the femur articulated into the pelviswe could see the head of the femur. What they didnt know was whether any more of the creature was buried beneath the sand, or whether the rest of the dinosaur had already been washed away from erosion. Phipps marked the spot carefully in his minds eye, and then he and the party headed home. The answers to these mysteries would have to wait for another time. I had 260 acres of hay to cut, he says. From remarkable T. rex skeletons to a 66 million year old mummy, here are 10 celebrated fossils unearthed at Hell Creek Map credit Guilbert Gates Research credit Ginny Mohler  Later that summer, after the hay was mowed, rolled and put upfeed for his cattle over the long winterPhipps returned to the secret location, this time in the company of Lige Murray, the landowner. Now Phipps found pieces of ceratops frill that had already weathered out of the bank. He could also see a line of vertebrae leading toward a skull. It seemed likely the dinosaurs back end was buried in the hillmeaning there was a good chance it was still intact. Murray gave his approval, and Phipps began the painstaking process of excavating, starting with a brush and a penknife. Meanwhile, business partners were gathered contracts were signed. A 150,000 loan was arranged. A road to the site was constructed. Most of the arduous work of extraction was done by Phipps and OConnor. He doesnt get around very good, but hes got a great sense of humor, Phipps says of his cousin, who helped ease the burden of their long, hot days. Eatman came up on weekends to help, as did a small cast of confidants and colleagues, who lent elbow grease and expertise. The find was kept secret throughout the entire process. I didnt even tell my family until just before we finished the excavation, Phipps says. After two weeks, Phipps had established a perimeter around the ceratopsian from head to tail. We had basically all the bones to his body mapped out at that point, he says. One day he was sitting in the cab of a backhoe hed borrowed from his uncle, which he was using to remove the soil behind and around the specimen to prepare the area for the fossils removal. I went to dump my bucketas usual I was watching very carefully, Phipps recalls. Suddenly I see these bone chips. The bones were easy to tell from the light colored sand because they were dark in color, like dark chocolate. Phipps clambered down off the backhoe and began to sift the contents of the bucket by hand. Thats when he saw it There was a claw, he says. And it was a carnivore claw. Its not any bone that goes with a ceratopsian. Phipps smiles at the memory. Man, my hat went in the air, he recalls. And then I had to sit down and think, like, Whats going on? Here is this meat eater in with this plant eater, and obviously they werent friends. What are the odds of another dinosaur being there? It took Phipps and his partners three months to extract the specimens from the remote site. The sinewy Phipps lost 15 pounds in the process. Railroad ties were inserted beneath the Dueling Dinosaurs to preserve their position and integrity. Plaster jackets were placed around the exposed bone, a standard procedure among paleontologists. In the end there were four large sections and several smaller onesall together they weighed nearly 20 tons. The section of earth containing the theropod alone was the size of a small car, weighing some 12,000 pounds. Phipps enlisted the help of friends at CK Preparations, run by a preparer named Chris Morrow and the paleo\u00adartist Katie Busch. The multi ton blocks were transported to a facility in northeastern Montana, where Phipps and his partners carefully removed the jackets. Next the specimens were cleaned down to the outline of the bones, so you could see everything that was there, how each animal is arranged, Phipps says. About 30 percent of the fossils were exposed, the bones shiny and dark. In situ, Phipps explains, using a model he holds in his lap, the skeletons overlapped, with the tail of the theropod, which was about the size of a polar bear, resting beneath the back foot of the elephant size ceratopsian. Both dinosaurs, buried in some 17 feet of sand, are fully articulated, meaning their skeletons are intact from nose to tail. Phipps speculates that on the day in question, scores of millions of years ago, one or more\u00a0Nanotyrannuses\u00a0attacked the ceratopsian. A number of theropod teeth were found around the site, and at least two were embedded in what were the ceratopsians fleshy areas, one in the throat and one near the pelvis. Scientists believe that theropods shed teeth and quickly regrew them, like sharks. In this case, Phipps says, some of the theropods teeth are broken in half, indicating a violent fight. A pitched battle ensued. The ceratopsian is almost ready to die, Phipps says, picking up the narration and growing animated. Hes hot, hes tired, hes whipped, hes bleeding from all the bite marks in him. Just as the ceratopsian is about to tip over, he staggers around and steps on the nanos tail. Well that hurts, right? So the nano bites the ceratopsians leg. And whats the ceratopsian gonna do? Instinctively he kicks the nano in the face. The nanos skull is actually cracked. When the ceratopsian caved in the side of the nanos head, the force slammed him into a loose sandbankand the wall of sand came down, burying them both instantly. Theres so much science in these dinosaurs Phipps exclaims, a rare show of emotion from a guy who likes to wear his black cowboy hat low on his brow. There may be last meals, there may be eggs, there may be babieswe dont know.  Well aware hed found something special, Phipps set out to alert the world. There was only one problem Nobody would listen. We called every major American museum and told them what we had, Phipps says. But I was a nobody. A lot of them probably thought, Yeah, right. This guy is crazy. Nobody sent anyone to verify what wed found. In time, though, word got out. Sampson, the Canadian paleontologist, then with the Denver Museum of Nature  Science, spent an hour with a group from the museum examining the fossils in a Quonset hut in eastern Montana. We were blown away, Sampson says. Its an amazing specimen. Several other experts whove seen the Dueling Dinosaurs have come to the same conclusion. Its exquisite, says Kirk Johnson, director of the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. Its one of the more beautiful fossils found in North America, ever. Tyler Lyson, a curator at the Denver Museum of Nature  Science, calls it a spectacular discovery. Any museum would love to have it. But not everyone agrees. As far as Im concerned, those specimens are scientifically useless, says Jack Horner, the pioneering and world famous paleontologist who was the inspiration for the dinosaur expert played by Sam Neill in\u00a0Jurassic Park. Every single specimen collected by a commercial collector is useless, because they do not come with any of the data that academically trained paleontologists are careful to collect, Horner says. As time dragged on, Phipps tried everything he could think of to find a buyer for the Dueling Dinosaurs. There were a few museums that were interested, he says. We got close with one. I was negotiating with the director, and we actually came to an agreement on a price at one point. And thennothing happened. They didnt get back to us. I dont know more than that.  In 2013, after seven years in the lab of CK Preparations, the Dueling Dinosaurs were brought to auction at Bonhams, in New York City. It was valued by appraisers as high as 9 million, according to Phipps. To transport the specimens from Montana, custom crates had to be built for each section. A special semi truck with an air ride suspension was hired. Phipps and his party flew to New York. Bonhams displayed the fossils in a large atrium room at its facility on Madison Avenue. The crowd at the event was a mix of professorial baby boomers, wily prospectors, impeccably dressed collectors, according to an account of the event published by the website Gizmodo. Phipps, the website reported, wore a ranchers vest, neckerchief and black cowboy hat. The bidding on the Dueling Dinosaurs lasted just 81 seconds. The only offer was 5.5 million, which failed to meet the reserve. Although the reserve price was not publicly announced, Phipps says it was closer to the appraised figure of around 9 million. I just felt that they were worth probably twice what we were offered, Phipps says. We were expecting better, and we werent willing to take that. Perhaps reflecting the falling market for fossils, a number of other items failed to sell that day, including a triceratops skeleton, valued between 700,000 and 900,000, and a\u00a0Tyrannosaurus rex\u00a0valued at up to 2.2 million. Three years later, sitting in his office, there is regret in his voice. The reason they went to auction was sort of out of frustration on my part. And then it was over before it started. It was disappointing that we couldnt make a sale, but I guess I was half expecting it. My attitude is always the same You dont count your chickens before they hatch. Since then, the Dueling Dinosaurs have been housed in a storage facility at an undisclosed location in New York. They remain unstudied more than a decade after they were exhumed. In the meantime, Phipps has been regarded by some, however undeservedly, as a privateer devoted more to money than to science. Ive never had any money, so moneys never been all that important to me, he says. But Im not gonna just give them away. There were people that said I should just donate them. Well, no. Ive got partners. Ive put too much into the project. I was out there trying to make a living. Its just like them academics that come out every summer between classes to look for fossilstheyre trying to make a living, too. Johnson, of the Smithsonian, says there is tremendous value in the Dueling Dinosaurs, despite some of the criticisms leveled against how the specimens were excavated. Theres scientific value, theres display value, theres the novelty of the two of the dinosaurs being adjacent, he says. But, he adds, the price tag is sort of out of reach of most museums, unless somebody comes along who wants to buy it and donate it. And that hasnt happened yet. Johnson says he viewed the Dueling Dinosaurs in the company of a wealthy museum supporter whom he invited, hoping the man might take an interest in the fossil. It turned out the donor had already seen itwith an official from another museum. There really arent that many buyers for something like this. The sale of Sue, the\u00a0T. rex, for more than 7 million, was a high water mark for fossils, Johnson says, reflecting unprecedented donations by corporate sponsors like McDonalds and Disney. Sue changed everything, because ranchers went kind of nuts when they realized that dinosaurs werent just old bones, they were a source of moneyand that screwed everything up. Tyler Lyson, of the Denver Museum, says it would unquestionably be a shame if it ultimately doesnt end up in a museum. A Yale trained paleontologist who grew up about three hours southeast of Phipps, along the Montana North Dakota border, Lyson got his start hunting fossils on ranch land homesteaded by his mothers family. Improbably, through a series of scholarships, his childhood hobby became his lifes work. Theres only a certain percentage of people on the planet who are interested in fossils to begin with, Lyson says. We all share that common bond, even though we might be interested for different reasons.  At five oclock, Phipps wife rings the dinner bell. Phipps hoists himself out of the chair and gingerly climbs the stairs. Three months ago, he and his 12 year old son were cutting a calf from the herd when Phipps horse slipped and rolled over on top of him. Phipps broke his leg in several places his foot was turned the wrong way. His son, thinking he was dead, began to administer CPR. Last week the screws were removed from the leg it looks like he will recover full use. Of course, during his convalescence, an entire prospecting season was lost, along with any hope of any income from fossilsrevenue that over the years has accounted for two thirds of his annual income, he says. Besides her duties at the nearby one room schoolhouse, Lisa Phipps has published two childrens books. We are joined at the table by the couples two boys, the younger of whom is 10. Their eldest, a daughter, is in nursing school. We eat a convivial supper of shredded chicken, potatoes and squash. The windows frame the rugged beauty of the surrounding countryside. The early evening sunlight creates an intimate glow. Beside my plate, in two little plastic bags, are a pair of triceratops teeth that Phipps has given me as a remembrance of my visit. The academics think what Im doing is horrid, Phipps is saying. They think Im destroying fossils and selling them to the highest bidder. But thats not true, he says, anger rising in his voice. I love fossils as much as they do. Granted, Im self taught. Im just a cowpoke, I dont know everything. But Ive had several paleontologists, even ones who dont exactly condone what I do, tell me I did a good job getting the fossils out. Maybe I didnt do the totally detailed scientific work like they do, but I dont have 30 college students under me working for nothing. When we found the Dueling Dinosaurs, I thought the academics would be big enough to bridge the gap. I figured theyd say, OK, this is a once in a lifetime find. Someday, Phipps hopes, the divide with the academic community will be bridged and whatever valuable scientific data the Dueling Dinosaurs retain will be reaped. The dinosaurs have been removed, he says. If we left them in the hill, the weather would have destroyed them in the last eight or ten years since we dug them out. We did the best we could with what we had at our disposal. You gotta make up your own mind if what I do is wrong or not. But to me, its not. After my visit, not long before this article went to press, Phipps told me that there have been renewed overtures from a museum interested in buying the Dueling Dinosaurs. There are some things happening, but Im not at liberty to discuss it, he said. But he did suggest that sufficient funds havent yet been raised. Its like anything in business, I guess. You want a fair price. Im gonna wait and see what happens. Im not in any hurry. In the meantime, Phipps says, Ive paid back my debts, and Im trying to build the ranch up a little more, and to get more cattle. Im leasing more ground now, too. Im trying to focus on that, because fossils arent a guarantee, you know?

Head, who specializes in fossil insects, recalls thinking, that looks kind of like a mushroom. But it wasnt just any mushroom. Standing at\u00a05 cm tall, the\u00a0squashed stalk topped with a droopy cap is the oldest fossilized mushroom yet found.  As Nicola Davis reports for the Guardian, the shroom\u00a0hails from the Crato Formation in Brazil, a series of rock that dates to about 115 million years ago. This means that the mushroom sprung from the ground when dinosaurs still trundled across the Earth. It is a rather extraordinary find Mushrooms are rarely preserved in the fossil record.\u00a0They dont live for very long, for one, and their soft and squishy bodies tend to decay quickly. Only ten fossilized mushrooms have ever been discovered, with the next oldest dating back\u00a099 million years.  Heads fossilized fungus is also unique because of the way in which it was preserved. All of the other known fossil mushrooms were engulfed by sticky tree resin, which later hardens into amber. But the recently discovered mushroom was subjected to a more dramatic journey. As Laura Geggel explains for\u00a0Live Science, the mushroom once grew on Gondawa, an ancient supercontinent that encompassed present day\u00a0South America, Africa, Arabia, Madagascar, India, Australia and Antarctica. It likely fell into a river and drifted along to a salty lagoon, where it sank and was covered by\u00a0sediment. Over millennia, its tissues were replaced with the mineral pyrite, which in turn transformed into the mineral goethiteand voila, the fossil was formed.  The fact that this mushroom was preserved at all is just astonishing, Heads said in a University of Illinois press release. When you think about it, the chances of this thing being herethe hurdles it had to overcome to get from where it was growing into the lagoon, be mineralized and preserved for 115 million yearshave to be minuscule. Most importantly, as the oldest member of its group, the find helps calibrate whats known as the molecular clock, a method that uses the rate of mutations in gene sequences to deduce how species evolve. This so called clock is calibrated with discoveries like the oldest mushroom, which can place more definitive dates on when certain groups begin. Heads and his team of researchers describe this marvelous mushroom in the journal PLOS One. The fungus, they write, had gills, or thin structures that hang from the cap of a mushroom. And they\u00a0gave a fitting name to this plucky little fungus Gondwanagaricites magnificus, or magnificent fossil mushroom from Gondwana."}, {"title": "Researchers Use Particle Accelerator to Peek Inside Fossilized Poop", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "June 9, 2017", "doc": "Scientists study every inch of an animalfrom the tip of their nose right down to their, well, poop. And the same goes for ancient creatures. But until now, only a limited amount could be learned from from studying fossilized feces, also known as coprolites. As\u00a0Ryan F.\u00a0Mandlebaum\u00a0reports for\u00a0Gizmodo, scientists recently turned to a synchrotron particle accelerator for help\u00a0discerning every morsel of data locked inside the prehistoric poop. Their study, published this week in the journal Scientific Reports, documents a new method to examine the treasures hidden within the coprolite without destroying the samples. These ancient turds are actually troves of information. Due to their phosphate rich chemistry, poop can actually preserve many delicate specimens, such as muscle, soft tissue, hair and parasites. But accessing all those bits and pieces usually means cutting the fossil into thin slices and examining it under different microscopes, a process that not only destroys part of the fossil but may not reveal all the\u00a0minute details. In recent years, some researchers have begun examining coprolites using CT scans, which produce three dimensional images of their innards, but those often produce poor contrast images. So Martin Qvarnstr\u00f6m, lead author on the study, and his team from Swedens Uppsala University began searching for a solution. The team took a pair of 230 million year old\u00a0coprolites from Poland to the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, to try to get a look\u00a0inside, using a technique\u00a0with a frighteningly long name\u00a0propagation phase contrast synchrotron microtomography.\u00a0 In essence, the circular half mile particle accelerator strikes the coprolite with x rays thousands of\u00a0times stronger than a CT scan, allowing the researchers to build an incredibly detailed 3D model of the interior of the fossil. The experiment worked. In one coprolite the researchers\u00a0found the remains of three beetle species, including two wing cases and a part of a leg. The other specimen contained crushed clam shells and pieces of a fish. The researchers believe that hunk of poop came from a large lungfish, the fossil of which was found near the coprolite. We have so far only seen the top of the iceberg Qvarnstr\u00f6m says in a\u00a0press release. The next step will be to analyze all types of coprolites from the same fossil locality in order to work out who ate what or whom and understand the interactions within the ecosystem. The technique could help coprolites take center stage in paleontology, much as other\u00a0trace fossils\u00a0like dinosaur footprints and fossilized vomit has become increasingly important in recent years. Analyzing coprolites at this level of detail opens up an entire new universe of research possibilities for those interested in reconstructing the paleobiology of extinct organisms, NYU anthropology professor Terry Harrison tells Mandelbaum. In other words, this new method provides quite the dump of information."}, {"title": "T. Rex Was Likely Covered in Scales, Not Feathers", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "June 8, 2017", "doc": "Tyrannosaurus rex\u200b\u00a0has long been depicted with scaly, reptile like skin. Over the past few decades, however, new research has\u00a0called the accuracy of that portrayal into question. Evidence of feathers was discovered on the fossils of earlier tyrannosaurs, leading scientists to believe that the king of the dinos may have boasted fluffy plumage.  But as Jason Bittel reports for National Geographic, new research suggests that the T. rex\u00a0of\u00a0our favorite childhood movies may have not been too far from the truth. According to a study recently published in the journal Biology Letters, the T. rexs skin was likely\u00a0scaly.  An international team of researchers studied skin impressions taken from T. rex fossils found in Montana. They then compared those impressions to fossilized skin patches of other tryannosaurs, like the Albertosaurus, Daspletosaurus, Gorgosaurus,\u00a0and\u00a0Tarbosaurus. The samples represented parts of the dinosaurs stomach, chest, neck, pelvis, and tail, according to Ben Guarino of the Washington Post. And none bore any traces of feathers.  These findings indicate that most if not all large bodied tyrannosaurids were scaly, the authors of the study write. They add that the T. rex may have had some feathers, but the plumage was likely limited to the dinosaurs back.  Since there is ample evidence to suggest that earlier tryannosaurs had feathers, the studys conclusions would mean that tyrannosaurs evolved a feathery coat, only to eventually lose it. The studys authors believe that the T. rexs size can help explain the evolutionary shift, Bittel reports.   This is tyrannosaur skin UAlberta science dinosaurs pic.twitter.comZwN08xOg2D T. rex\u00a0were much bigger than their predecessors, having developed long legs that let them dash after prey. But large and active animals dont cool down as quickly as smaller creatures. So as they got bigger, researchers think that the\u00a0dinosaurs may have lost their plumage.\u00a0Feathers were too much of a hindrance to cooling off after a sprint, Bittel writes. \u00a0  There was, however, at least one massive tryannosaur that had feathers. The Yutyrannus,\u00a0discovered several years ago in China, stretched about 30 feet long and was covered in fine feathers. This dinosaur was smaller than the\u00a0T. rex, but about the same size as the\u00a0Albertosaurus\u00a0and\u00a0Gorgosaurus, which means that size cant be the only factor that determines whether or not a dino sports a downy coat. So the authors of the study offer an additional hypothesis the\u00a0Yutyrannus\u00a0had feathers because it lived in shady forests, which helped the dinosaur keep its cool.  A similar phenomenon can be seen in elephants of today, as Helen Briggs of the BBC\u00a0points out. Asian elephants have more hair than African elephants not only because they are smaller, but also because they live in dense forest environments.  But the studys findings are not conclusive. Soft tissues like feathers are only preserved in the fossil record under specific circumstances, so just because we dont see them doesnt mean they werent there, Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh told Briggs. So it is still possible that the most fearsome of all the dinosaurs was fluffy and soft."}, {"title": "Spectacularly Detailed Armored Dinosaur \u201cMummy\u201d Makes Its Debut", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "May 15, 2017", "doc": "In 2011, a\u00a0heavy equipment operator at the Millennium Mine in northern Alberta started digging\u00a0up odd colored rock. He stopped to take a closer look, puzzling over the material, which was speckled with strange patterns. His supervisor quickly realized they had something special, Michael Greshko reports for\u00a0National Geographic. The operator had just extracted a bit of fossilized skin from an armored nodasaurus, a type of ankylosaur. But this wasnt just any fossil, it was one of the best preserved nodasaurus\u00a0specimens ever found.\u00a0 The fossil remains are\u00a0incredibly lifelike, resembling a sleeping dragon. According National Geographic, which sponsored the five year, 7,000 hour preparation of the fossil, its likely that the 3,000 pound,18 foot long creature died in or near a river. Then its bloated carcass floated out to sea before sinking back first into the muck where fossilization began. \u00a0 Its basically a dinosaur mummyit really is exceptional, Don Brinkman, director of preservation and research at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the fossil is housed tells\u00a0Craig S. Smith at\u00a0The New York Times. The remarkable preservation of its armored plates, as well as some preserved scales, are helping paleontologists finally understand the size and shape of the creatures keratin defenses. Ive been calling this one the Rosetta stone for armor, Donald Henderson, curator of dinosaurs at the Tyrrell Museum tells Greshko.  As\u00a0Matt Rehbein at CNN\u00a0reports,\u00a0the dino is 110 million years old, making it the oldest ever found in Alberta. It also represents a new genus and species of nodosaur. But the most exciting aspect may be at the microscopic level, Greshko reports. The researchers have detected miniscule bits of red pigment, which could help them reconstruct the dinosaurs colorationa feature that may have helped it attract mates. This armor was clearly providing protection, but those elaborated horns on the front of its body would have been almost like a billboard, Jakob Vinther, an animal coloration expert from the University of Bristol who has studied the fossil, tells Greshko. The new specimen isnt the only exceptional ankylosaur specimen recently unveiled. Just last week\u00a0Brian Switek at Smithsonian.com\u00a0reported that the Royal Ontario Museum discovered a new species in Montana, which they nicknamed Zuul. That specimen also has some intact armor plates and skin as well as a tail club. Switek explains that during decomposition the armor plates of ankylosaurs\u00a0typically fall off and are often washed away or not found. But the discovery of these two extraordinary samples will go a long way towards helping researchers figure just what these animals looked like and how they used their formidable horns and armor.

Generation after generation, the creatures slowly changed, losing their hind limbs and gaining flippers. A group of these early creatures, known as the\u00a0basilosaurids, evolved into two broad groups of whales that are found today\u00a0the toothed whales,\u00a0like modern sperm whales and orcas, and the filter feeding baleen whales, like todays\u00a0blue whales and humpbacks. Molecular and genetic research suggests\u00a0that this split took place roughly 38 to 39 million years ago, but until now no fossils of these early creatures had been found. But as\u00a0Sarah\u00a0McQuate\u00a0reports for\u00a0Nature, scientists have uncovered the oldest baleen whale relative yet. And at 36.4 million years old, this this fossil fills in the gaps in whale evolution As\u00a0McQuate reports,\u00a0the new species was excavated from Playa Media Luna in the Pisco Basin area of southern Peru and has been named Mystacodon selenensis. The creature was likely about 13 feet long, the length of a bottlenosed dolphin. But unlike modern baleen whales, which use plates made of keratin to screen krill and other small organisms out of the water, M. selenensis\u00a0had teeth and likely sucked up small creatures like shrimp or squid off the bottom of the ocean floor. That suction feeding technique links\u00a0M. selenensis to older species and modern whales.\u00a0It perfectly matches what we would have expected as an intermediary step between ancestral basilosaurids and more derived mysticetes baleen whales, paleontologist Olivier Lambert of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences and co author of the paper in Current Biology,\u00a0says in a press release. This nicely demonstrates the predictive power of the theory of evolution. As\u00a0Nicola Davis at The Guardian reports, the find also jibes with another whale fossil discovered, dubbed Alfred. That specimen dates back some 25 million years ago and was also a suction feeder, suggesting that it took a long time for modern baleen feeding to develop. While the fossil bears out paleontologists predictions, it did come with one big surprise\u00a0it had tiny hind limbs sticking out of its body, Davis reports. Lambert says that these tiny limbs\u00a0had no real functionalso known as vestigial organs. But the find upturned researchers belief that whales completely lost their back limbs before the\u00a0toothed and baleen whale ancestors split. Paleontologists have been slow to put together the whale family tree, Lambert says,\u00a0because they have been looking for fossils close to home\u00a0in Europe and North America. But it turns out that much of the action in whale evolution took place in Antarctica, Peru, and India. Now that they are looking in the right places, they are finding more and more specimens. Thats also a plus for evolutionary theory in general. For a long time, Creationists took the evolution of whales as a favorite target to say that, Well, you say that whales come from a terrestrial ancestor, but you cant prove it. You cant show the intermediary steps in this evolution, Lambert says in the press release. And that was true, maybe thirty years ago. But now, with more teams working on the subject, we have a far more convincing scenario."}, {"title": "Ancient Creature Left a 28-Foot Drag Mark After It Died", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "May 11, 2017", "doc": "Some 150 million years ago, a\u00a0squid like creature that lived\u00a0in a coil shaped shell, also known as an ammonite, died. Its shell drifted to the bottom of a tropical lagoon, dragging along in the current nearly 28 feet before settling into it final resting spot. Millions of years later, as\u00a0Helen Briggs reports for\u00a0the BBC, scientists have unearthed the mark along with the shell in a stone quarry in Solnhofen, Germany. They published a paper this week\u00a0describing the find this week in the journal\u00a0PLOS One. The fossil is perhaps one of the most unlikely of fossils to have ever been preserved, let alone be discovered, Dean Lomax paleontologist from the University of Manchester who led the study in the journal\u00a0\u00a0tells Briggs. Its a real chance findthat provides a snapshot of a moment that is captured in timeit really tells a story. The ammonite owner of the shell likely died between 163 and 145 million year ago, according to the study. These creatures\u00a0jetted around the oceans\u00a0from roughly 240 million years ago until about 65\u00a0million years ago.\u00a0  As\u00a0Stephanie Pappas at\u00a0LiveScience\u00a0reports, Lomax and his colleagues made a 3D model of the ammonite and its track using a method known as\u00a0photogrammatry, which involves taking and combining hundreds of photos of a subject from many different angles. The resulting model\u00a0shows that at its tip, the death drag is a mere 0.3 inches wide and is composed of two grooves. But as the shell was pulled along by the current the impression widened, till 18 ridges become visible before the ammonite plopped over. Lomax tells Pappas its likely that the water was between 65 and 200 feet deep, and that the current was strong enough to propel the shell, but not strong enough to disturb the sandy bottom. If the current was very fast, then the ammonite would likely have bounced as opposed to drifted, he says.  This isnt the first ammonite marks found in the limestone, though it is by far the longest. According to the study, researchers first interpreted such impressions as claw marks, ripples from fish or paths made by turtles or coelacanths.

It was obvious The saur just had to be named Zuul. Between the armored dinosaurs prominent horns and blunt snout, Arbour immediately saw a resemblance to the monstrous gatekeeper from 1984s Ghostbusters. I half jokingly said that it really ought to be Zuul, she says, recalling batting around names for the newly discovered, 75 million year old ankylosaur with Royal Ontario Museum colleague David Evans. Evans immediately agreed, and now science welcomes a creature with one of nerdiest names ever selected for the ranks of Dinosauria.\u00a0 But theres far more to Zuul than a cheeky name. The dinosaur was spectacularly preserved, including its skull, part of its skeleton and its iconic club tail, Arbour and Evans report today in the journal\u00a0Royal Society Open Science. Thanks to that preservation, Zuul offers paleontologists a closer look at how armored dinosaurs may have arrayed their spiky ornamentation for defense. Zuul ranks among the ankylosauridsprickly, club tailed dinosaurs that experts like to call living tanks. Their tubby, low slung frames were dotted by distinctive patterns of pointed bonescalled osteodermsthat acted as ornamentation as well as possible defense against the tyrannosaurs of their time. These animals were so well protected that, in some species, even the eyelids were armored.\u00a0 Finding a fossilized skull alone would have made Zuul easy enough to tell apart from its relatives. While the new dinosaurdiscovered in the Judith River Formation of northern Montanashares some similarities in skull shape with ankylosaurs from Montana and Alberta, Arbour says, Zuul would be easy to recognize based on the shape of the horns at the back of the skull and by the rough, peaked ornamentation along the snout and in between the eyes on the forehead. But the new finding included much more than just the skull It was attached to a partial skeleton and tail club, making it the most complete dinosaur of its kind yet discovered in North America. In North America, ankylosaurids form only about five percent of the dinosaur fauna Evans says. The discovery of new species like Zuul, therefore, offers key pieces to the puzzle of how the continents dinosaur communities evolved. Even better, this fossil preserves skin impressions and some of those armor plates held in their original place. Because the armor plates are in the skin, they often fall away from the skeleton after death as the animal is decomposing, Arbour says. In Zuul they stayed put, with fossils of skin and the keratin sheaths that covered the bony armor to bootoffering a rare glimpse at what this dinosaur really looked like.\u00a0  Despite being an herbivore,\u00a0Zuul\u00a0would have had cut a rather imposing figure. Ankylosaurids had highly modified tails to carry the hefty tail clubs at the end, which researchers thinks they swung at the limbs of attackers with painful precision. Arbour has gone so far as to catalog depictions of ankylosaurs\u00a0swatting their foes, from childrens books to\u00a0Jurassic World. The interlocking vertebrae near the end of the tail had a thin V shape, buttressed along their length by ossified tendons to create what paleontologists call the handle for the tail club.\u00a0 Like other ankylosaurids known from exceptional tails,\u00a0Zuul\u00a0also had additional armor running almost all the way to the club. Broad triangular spikes just out from both sides of the tail, giving this dinosaur a rather sharp look. No wonder that Arbour and Evans decided to give\u00a0Zuul\u00a0the species name crurivastatormeaning shin destroyerin recognition of the dinosaurs potential to be a literal pain to the tyrannosaurs of its time.\u00a0 Ive been itching to name an ankylosaur ankle breaker for years, but was waiting for a specimen that included a nice tail club, Arbour says, and they dont get much nicer than this. But did\u00a0Zuul\u00a0actually use its\u00a0sledgehammer tail to break the bones of its attackers?\u00a0We arent sure. In a\u00a0previous study, Arbour surveyed ankylosaur skeletons for signs of healed fractures that would support the idea that these dinosaurs were using their unusual anatomy to defend themselves. Of the few injuries that turned up, none conclusively supported the tail clubbing hypothesis. If ankylosaurs were whacking other dinosaurs, their skeletons havent turned up the crucial evidence yet. Nevertheless, Arbour says, theres still good reason to think that all that ornate armor had a practical use. Some tyrannosaur skeletons show healed shin fractures, Arbour says, which could be signs of reprimands delivered with sledgehammer force by the ankylosaurs they lived alongside.\u00a0 Then again, maybe ankylosaurs were more worried about each other than predators. When we think about animals alive today, Arbour says, most animals with specialized weapons like horns or antlers use them for fighting members of their own species, so its also possible that Zuul turned its tail club on other ankylosaurs when fighting for mates or territory.\u00a0 Whether paleontologists will ever know for certain what ankylosaurs used their tail clubs for is a secret still held by the fossil record. All the same, Zuul offers one of the closest looks at an ankylosaur as a living animal and not a jumble of bones. Arbour and Evans report that the dinosaurs torso was wrapped up in a block of stone weighing over 15 metric tonnes. From what paleontologists may still learn from this skeleton, Zuul may become a new gatekeeper for our understanding of the most ornate dinosaurs to walk the Earth."}, {"title": "Remarkable New Evidence for Human Activity in North America 130,000 Years Ago", "author": "Brigit Katz", "date": "April 26, 2017", "doc": "In 1992, construction workers were digging up a freeway in San Diego, California when they came across a trove of ancient bones. Among them were the remains of dire wolves, camels, horses and gophersbut the most intriguing were those belonging to an adult male mastodon. After years of testing, an interdisciplinary team of researchers announced this week that these mastodon bones date back to 130,000 years ago.\u00a0 The researchers then went on to make an even more stunning assertion These bones, they claim, also bear the marks of human activity. The teams findings, published today\u00a0in the journal\u00a0Nature, could upend our current understanding of when humans arrived in North Americaalready a flashpoint among archaeologists. Recent theories posit that people first migrated to the continent about 15,000 years ago along a coastal route, as Jason Daley writes in\u00a0Smithsonian. But in January, a new analysis of horse remains from the Bluefish Caves by archaeologist Jacques Cinq Mars suggested that humans may have lived on the continent as early as 24,000 years ago. The new study, however, suggests that some type of hominin speciesearly human relatives from the genus Homowas bashing up mastodon bones in North America about 115,000 years earlier than the commonly accepted date. Thats a staggeringly early date, and one that is likely to raise eyebrows. There is no other archaeological evidence attesting to such an early human presence in North America. I realize that 130,000 years is a really old date, Thomas Dem\u00e9r\u00e9, principal paleontologist at the San Diego Museum of Natural History and one of the authors of the study, conceded during a press conference. Of course, extraordinary claims like this require extraordinary evidence. Dem\u00e9r\u00e9 and his co authors believe that their discoveries at the Cerutti Mastodon siteas the area of excavation is knownprovide just that.\u00a0         Palaeontologists working at the site found an assortment of mastodon\u00a0remains, including two tusks, three molars, 16 ribs, and more than 300 bone fragments. These fragments bore impact marks suggesting that they had been smacked with a hard object Some of the shattered bones contained spiral fractures, indicating that they were broken while still fresh, the authors write.\u00a0 Amidst the fine grain sands at the site, researchers also discovered five hulking stones. According to the study, the stones were used as makeshift hammers and anvils, or cobbles. They showed signs of impactfragments found in the area could in fact be repositioned back into the cobblesand two distinct clusters of broken bones surrounded the stones, suggesting that the bones had been smashed in that location. These patterns taken together have led us to the conclusion that humans were processing mastodon bones using hammer stones and anvils, Dem\u00e9r\u00e9 said at the press conference. He was joined by three of his co authors Steven Holen, co director of the Center for American Paleolithic Research James Paces, a research geologist at the United States Geological Survey and Richard Fullagar, a professor of archaeology at the University of Wollongong, Australia. There is no evidence of butchery at the site, so the team suspects that its occupants were breaking the bones to make tools and extract marrow. To bolster their theory, researchers analyzed mastodon bones found in later North American sites, which date from 14,000 to 33,000 years ago. These bones displayed the same fracture patterns that were observed among the remains of the Cerutti Mastodon. Researchers also tried to replicate the activity that may have occurred at the site by smacking\u00a0at the bones of a recently deceased elephant, the mastodons closest living relative. Their efforts produced exactly the same kinds of fracture patterns that we see on the Cerutti mastodon limb bones, said Holen. We can eliminate all of the natural processes that break bones like this, Holen added. These bones were not broken by carnivore chewing, they were not broken by other animals trampling on the bone.  While some members of the team were wreaking havoc on elephant remains, efforts were underway to date the Cerutti mastodon bones. Attempts at radiocarbon dating proved unsuccessful because the bones did not contain a sufficient amount of carbon containing collagen. So researchers turned to uraniumthorium dating, a technique that is often used to check radiocarbon derived dates.\u00a0Uraniumthorium dating, which can be used on carbonate sediments,\u00a0bones and teeth, makes it possible to date objects far older than 50,000 years, the upper limit of radiocarbon dating. Using this method, scientists were able to assign an approximate age of 130,000 years to the Cerutti bones.\u00a0 While the studys authors believe that their evidence is ironclad, other experts arent so sure.\u00a0Briana Pobiner,\u00a0a paleoanthropologist with the Smithsonian Institutions Human Origins Program, says it is nearly impossible to rule out the possibility that the bones were broken by natural processes, like sediment impaction. \u00a0\u00a0 I would have liked to see really easily identifiable stone tools, she says The study theorizes that early humans were bashing open bones with natural rocks. Both of those things are kind of hard to distinguish in the archaeological record book natural rocks that were used and also the bones that were bashed open.\u00a0 Still, Pobiner says she is excited about the researchers findings. They have broken mammoth bones, they have broken stones, they have patterning, and damage and wear on both the bones and the stones, which look human modified, she explains. I think that the combination of evidence is on the way to being convincing.\u00a0 The authors of the study have anticipated that their conclusions will be met with some wariness. I know people will be skeptical of this, because it is so surprising, Holen said during the press conference. I was skeptical when I first looked at the material myself. But its definitely an archaeological site.  Researchers also acknowledged that for now, the study raises more questions than it answers. For instance Who were the early humans described by the study, and how did they arrive in North America? The simple answer is we dont know, said Fullagar. But he went on to venture a few guesses. The occupants of the Cerutti Mastodon site could have been Neanderthals, their\u00a0Denisoven\u00a0cousins, or even anatomically modern humans. They might have been some type of hybrid population. Recent genetic studies indicate that rather than dealing with a single, isolated species of migrating hominids or humans, were actually dealing with an intermixing, a kind of meta population of humans, Fullagar noted. These humans, whoever they were, may have migrated across\u00a0the\u00a0Bering land bridge\u00a0or sailed along the coast to North America, researchers said. There is evidence to suggest that early humans in other parts of the world were able to make water crossings. Archaeologists have found hand axes dating to at least 130,000 years ago on the island of Crete, which has been surrounded by water for about five million years, according to Heather Pringle at\u00a0National Geographic.\u00a0\u00a0 Moving forward, the team plans to seek out new archaeological sites and take a fresh look at artifact collections that may contain undetected signs of human activity. We fully intend to keep this type of research going in the future, to look in collections all over Southern California, and to continue to do fieldwork looking for more sites of this age, Holen said. If humans did roam through North America 130,000 years ago, their numbers were likely sparse. This means that the chances of finding human remains are slimbut not out of the question, says Pobiner of Smithsonian. If people were in North America 130,000 years ago, she said. I dont see why we wouldnt find them."}, {"title": "Man-Eating Lions of Tsavo Did Indeed Eat People, Teeth Reveal", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "April 19, 2017", "doc": "Theyre two of the most notorious killers in history The lions of Tsavo, a pair of maneless males implicated in dozens of deaths before they were shot by Colonel J.H. Patterson in 1898. Their depredations were legendary enough to inspire a major motion picture, The Ghost and the Darkness, back when Val Kilmer was an A list celebrity. Yet legends often overshadow reality, especially when we look into the maws of creatures that developed a predilection for human flesh. A new study by paleoecologist Larisa DeSantis and zoologist Bruce Patterson no relation, published in Scientific Reports, helps disentangle myth from reality when it comes to Africas most famous man eaters.\n\nTheres something deeply unsettling about the concept of being eaten. While todays lions and big cats kill people every year, beasts that take the next step and actually consume humans send a shiver down our spines. Those disturbing dining habits no doubt fed the celebrity of the Tsavo lions, said by Colonel Patterson to have been responsible for the deaths of 135 people. The actual total was probably far lowera 2009 study of chemical traces in the lions teeth estimating that the two consumed about 35 peoplebut they still ate humans often enough that signs of their unusual menu choices should be visible on their teeth.  This is where DeSantis and Patterson comes in. For those who scour bones, teeth not only lend insight into what kind of food an animal evolved to eatthey also record what an individual animal was eating in the days and weeks before death. These microscopic clues are called microwear, and include scratches and pits that can be linked to particular types of foods. For the new study, DeSantis and Patterson looked at the microwear preserved on the teeth of the Tsavo lionsas well as the Mfuwe lion that ate six people in 1991to see if their teeth showed a shift in diet compared to other lions, cheetahs and hyenas.\n\nThey were especially on the lookout for signs the lions were cracking the skeletons of their victims. They already had eyewitness testimony. In his account of what transpired at Tsavo, Colonel Patterson wrote I have very vivid recollection of one particular night when the brutes seized a man from the railway station and brought him close to my camp to devour. I could plainly hear them crunching the bones, and the sound of their dreadful purring filled the air and rang in my ears for days afterwards. Now the researchers wanted evidence. If the Colonel was right, such habits would have undoubtedly left their signature on the lions teeth, with microwear clues confirming the hunters colorful account. Yet DeSantis and Patterson didnt find corroboration for this chilling part of the story. We were surprised to see no evidence of extreme durophagywhich is paleo speak for chewing hard food like bonesDeSantis says. That lack of evidence also ran counter to one of the traditional explanations of the lions man eating behavior. It was thought that a local outbreak of a disease called rinderpest had wiped out the zebra and wildebeest that the lions normally preyed on, making the cats desperate enough to prey on humans, who the lions then consumed entirely. But the new study reveals that the lions were not scavenging buried humans or crunching bones out of desperation.\n\nWe thought we were going to provide concrete evidence that these lions were scavenging and thoroughly consuming carcasses before they died, DeSantis says. Instead, she notes, the man eating lions have microscopic wear patterns similar to captive lions that are typically provided with softer food. In the case of the lions kept at the Smithosonians National Zoo, curator of great cats Craig Saffoe says the lions get a base diet of ground beef, supplemented with specific vitamins and nutrients six days a week,\u00a0with a whole frozen rabbit once a week and defleshed beef bones twice a week. But for the Tsavo and Mfuwe lions, a good proportion of that softer food was human flesh.\n\nExactly why the Tsavo and Mfuwe lions turned to hunting humans remains a mystery. Still, DeSantis and Patterson point out some potential contributing factors. The Mfuwe lion, as well as one of the Tsavo lions, had extreme injuries to their jaws. They wouldnt have been as adept at taking their typical prey, so soft, tasty humans would have offered an attractive alternative. Even then, DeSantis says, humans were a food of last resort and the lions were primarily focused on the soft parts. These were not devilish skeleton crunchers, but injured cats doing what they could to survive.\n\nThe new study is a reminder that well kept historic specimens can often reveal ancient secrets later down the road, DeSantis notes. But the upshot is more than ancient history. We need to stop thinking of humans as on the top of the food chain, DeSantis says. The fossil record is clear that humans have been prey for other animals for\u00a0our entire history, and, DeSantis points out, 563 people were\u00a0killed by lions in Tanzania\u00a0alone between January of 1990 and September of 2004. Getting in your car to drive to work is still far more likely to be fatal than meeting a lion, of course. But that statistic is a reminder that other species do not recognize our self important strut as somehow outside or above nature. For some beasts, we are still prey."}, {"title": "Before There Were Dinosaurs, There Was This Weird Crocodile-Looking Thing", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "April 12, 2017", "doc": "Everybody knows about dinosaurs.

But even while we adore the terrifying Tyrannosaurus and breathtaking Brachiosaurus, we still know next to nothing about the earliest dinosaurs that arose over 235 million years agoand who exactly they evolved from.  That may be about to change, thanks to a new analysis of an enigmatic creature from the ancient rock of Tanzania. This crocodile like beast, it turns out, plays a starring role in the origin story of the terrible lizards.\n\nThe story of this new dinosaur predecessor, described by Virginia Tech paleontologist Michelle Stocker and colleagues in a Nature study published today, picks up in 1933. Thats when British paleontologist Rex Parrington collected some unusual bones from the 245 million year old rock of southern Tanzania. Those bones rested in storage until 1956 when paleontologist Alan Charig categorized them as some sort of archosaur, part of the major group of reptiles that includes dinosaurs and other lineagesbut it was difficult to say where exactly the species fell.  Nonetheless, Charig proposed a name for the animal in his unpublished research Teleocrater, or finished bowl, in reference to the saurians closed hip socket.  The reptiles hip may have been finished, but the story wasnt Charig never published his research on the animal, and so the mystery of Teleocrator remained unresolved. It wasnt until 2015, when a multi institution team of researchers recovered additional bones of Teleocrater from Tanzanias Manda Beds, that researchers began a new analysis of the ancient enigma.\n\nWhile significant, Parringtons Teleocrater find was relatively meager. The original material consists of limb elements and some vertebrae, Stocker says, but no skull material. This left Stocker and colleagues eager to find more bones during their field expeditions to Tanzania their 2015 jackpot added more elements of the hips, limbs, spine and skull of the animal. The new collection brought Teleocrater into finer focus This 10 foot long reptile walked on all fours, and its curved, serrated teeth hint that Teleocrater used its long neck to strike at protomammals and other small prey of its time.\n\nBut the most impressive thing about Teleocrater, Stocker and colleagues highlight, is its pedigree. Teleocrater was a very early predecessor of Mesozoic superstars like dinosaurs and the flying pterosaurs. The evolutionary arrangement goes like this.\n\nAmong the archosaurs, or ruling reptiles, there are two major groups the crocodiles and their relatives on one side, and the dinosaurs and their relatives on the other. The dinosaur and pterosaur side is called the Avemetatarsalia, or bird feet. Early on, it seemed impossible for scientists to tell which side of the split Teleocrater sat on, as the crucial bones were missing. But the new analysis places Teleocrater definitively near the base of the Avemetatarsaliathe line that includes dinosaurs and their closest relatives.  Its important to note that doesnt necessarily mean that Teleocrater was a direct dinosaur ancestor direct ancestry is almost always impossible to discern in the fossil record. Instead, Teleocrater and related reptiles from Triassic rocks act as stand ins that show paleontologists the general form and nature of dinosaur ancestors. In this case, that the earliest members of the dinosaur branch of the archosaur family tree were four legged meat eaters that still shared some features in common with their more distant crocodile cousins.\n\nThe characteristics that place Teleocrater as being just that much closer to dinosaurs than crocodiles are subtle a depression on a bone at the back of the skull the length of the neck vertebrae articulations on the spine and muscle attachment points on the arms and legs. Taken together, Stocker says, these qualities all pin Teleocrater as being an early member of the Avemetatarsalia line that would later spin off the dinosaurs.\n\nPaleontologists can still see Teleocrater as an animal in transition. Dinosaurs and their close relatives are often characterized by a simple hinge like ankle joint, while crocodiles and their kin have a more complex arrangement of bones. Yet despite being on the dinosaur side, the ankle of Teleocrater resembles that of a crocodile. This came as a surprise, Stocker says, and indicates that the more complex, crocodile type ankle shape was ancestral for archosaurs. It was the combination of continued fieldwork and previously collected specimens that allowed paleontologists to reconcile the identity of Teleocrater, Stocker says. Beyond Teleocrater, researchers are also beginning to identify other mystery animals from India and Russia as early members of the line that would give rise to dinosaurs and their kin that would go on to rule the world for well over 100 million years. Once the puzzle of Teleocrater was solved, the identity of other mysterious fossil reptiles snapped into focus. These kinds of finds are changing what paleontologists had come to expect of the earliest dinosaurs. For a long time we thought that the ancestral body plan of dinosaurs was small and bipedal, Stocker says, but Teleocrater instead shows us that those small bipedal forms were unique and on their own evolutionary path.\n\nAt the time Teleocrater prowled along the ancient river system it called home, dinosaurian dominance was still a long way off. It would take another mass extinction to give dinosaurs the edge they needed to step out of the shadow of the more numerous crocodile cousins that dominated the Triassic. But from our modern perspective, we can see in Teleocrater the glimmerings of what was to come a whisper of when dinosaurs would come to rule the Earth."}, {"title": "30-Million-Year-Old Tick Full of Monkey Blood Found in Ancient Amber", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "April 4, 2017", "doc": "Some 20 to 30 million years ago, in a tropical jungle in what is now the Dominican Republic, a mammalpossibly a monkeyplucked off a tick, pinched it\u00a0and dropped it into a little puddle of sticky resin oozing from a tree. Overtime, that gooey substance fossilized into an amber tomb for the parasite, preserving it and its last meal for future generations to see. The tick fossil was discovered by George Poinar, Jr., professor emeritus at Oregon State University who first put forth the idea of finding ancient DNA in amberthe inspiration for\u00a0Michael Crichtons Jurassic Park. Over the decades, hes discovered a steady stream of groundbreaking finds trapped in amber. In just the last year hes found that malaria could have infected the dinosaurs, beetles pollinated orchids 20 million years ago, and he even discovered a new order of insects. As\u00a0Ryan F. Mandelbaum\u00a0reports for\u00a0Gizmodo, the latest discovery comes from amber collected in the Cordillera Septentrional mountain range in the Dominican Republic. This blood engorged tick, just\u00a02.5 millimeters long, belongs to the genus Amblyomma\u200b.\u00a0Two small puncture wounds in its back allowed a minute amount of blood to trickle out, and were likely\u00a0the result of being unceremoniously plucked from its feast. Poinar polished the amber chunk to make it clearer and cracked it open to get a better view of the ticks gut contents, reports Entomology Today. The research will appear in the Journal of Medical Entomology.  Poinar speculates that the blood cells come from a monkey species. As\u00a0Entomology Today\u00a0reports, the size of the blood cells are consistent with primates.\u00a0I have no other hypotheses for the mammal host, he tells Mandelbaum. Too bad I couldnt find some monkey hair along with the sample.\u00a0 Though stray hairs were absent, he did find another hanger on blood parasites, Babesia microti, which causes a tick born disease that still\u00a0exists today. The life forms we find in amber can reveal so much about the history and evolution of diseases we still struggle with today, Poinar says in the press release. This parasite, for instance, was clearly around millions of years before humans, and appears to have evolved alongside primates, among other hosts. So will this discovery lead to some\u00a0Jurassic Monkeys?\u00a0 Its unlikely that well get the DNA of the mammal species anytime soon. Recovering DNA from amber encased creatures is highly improbable. And\u00a0Poinar\u00a0says he has no plans to try and extract the DNA from the blood cells since it would destroy the rare specimen."}, {"title": "New Study Restructures the Dinosaur Family Tree", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "March 24, 2017", "doc": "Back in 1887, British paleontologist Harry Seeley changed the dinosaur world when he began classifying the thunder lizards into two broad categories based on their hip structure. The group he dubbed saurischians had pelvic structures similar to modern day lizards and includes theropods large meat eaters like Tyrannosaurus, Herrerasauridae smaller meat eaters\u00a0and the massive sauropodomorphs which include the 70 ton Argentinosaurus. The second group,\u00a0ornithischians, have pelvic structures superficially similar to modern birds, and include classic armored dinos like Stegasaurus and Triceratops.\u00a0 But a new study published this week in the journal\u00a0Nature\u00a0suggests that Seeleys system, which has been in place for some 130 years, isnt quite right. And the suggestion\u00a0is shaking up the dino\u00a0world. As Ed Yong writes for The\u00a0Atlantic,\u00a0this is like someone telling you that neither cats nor dogs are what you thought they were, and some of the animals you call cats are actually dogs. So how did the studys authors arrive at this revelation? Researchers from the University of Cambridge and Natural History Museum in London analyzed the skeletons of 75 different dinosaur species, collecting 35,000 data points about 457 physical traits. What they found is that the theropods a group that\u00a0eventually gave rise to modern birds are in the wrong group. Based on their analysis these creatures should be moved in with the\u00a0ornithischians\u00a0and this new bunch could be renamed\u00a0Ornithoscelida. When we started our analysis, we puzzled as to why some ancient ornithischians appeared anatomically similar to theropods, Cambridge grad student Matt Baron, lead author of the study, says in a press release. But the results of their analysis suggest that the similarity is more than just superficial. This conclusion came as quite a shock, he says. If were correct, this study explains away many prior inconsistencies in our knowledge of dinosaur anatomy and relationships, says Paul Barrett, museum paleontologist and co author of the study. Luckily, most of what weve pieced together about dinosaurshow they fed, breathed, moved, reproduced, grew up, and socializedwill stand unchanged, Lindsay Zanno from the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, who was not involved in the study, tells Yong. However, she says these conclusions lead us to question the most basic structure of the entire dinosaur family tree, which we have used as the backbone of our research for over a century. If confirmed by independent studies, the changes will shake dinosaur paleontology to its core. There are several noticeable changes right off the bat, David Norman, researcher at\u00a0the University of Cambridge and co author of the study, explains\u00a0in a press release. The bird hipped dinosaurs, so often considered paradoxically named because they appeared to have nothing to do with bird origins, are now firmly attached to the ancestry of living birds. The move also explains why some ornithischians have some indication that they may have had feathers, according to a\u00a0press release from the Natural History Museum in London. If theropods and ornithischians come from one common ancestor, it means feathers only evolved once, instead of evolving separately in the two major branches of the dino tree. The research also indicates that the first dinosaurs may have evolved 247 million years agoa bit earlier than the current 231 to 243 million range, Yong explains. The study raises other questions, too. In the old system, ornithischians were considered plant eaters while all the meat eating dinosaurs were saurischians, meaning that the trait of eating meat could have evolved after the two main branches of dinosaurs split. But in the new system, meat eaters appear on both branches, making it more likely that the common ancestors of both branches were omnivores. Since\u00a0potential omnivorous\u00a0ancestors can be found in both the northern and southern hemispheres, the new association hints that the dinos\u00a0didnt necessarily originate in the southern half as previously believed. One possibility for their last common ancestor, writes Devlin, is a cat sized omnivore called Saltopus elginensis, unearthed in a quarry in Scotland. Max Langer, a respected\u00a0paleontologist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil tells Devlin that hes not convinced that Saltopus is the mother of dinos. Theres nothing special about this guy, he says. Saltopus is the right place in terms of evolution but you have much better fossils that would be better candidates for such a dinosaur precursor. Other researchers are now digging into the data set to see if the new classification holds up. Whether this new family tree sticks or not will be a matter of testing, Brian Switek, author of My Beloved Brontosaurus tells Devlin. One group of scientists has come up with what is no doubt a controversial hypothesis, and now others will see if they get the same result, or if the idea is bolstered by additional evidence."}, {"title": "How Did Sabercats Use Those Outlandish Fangs?", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "March 21, 2017", "doc": "Of all the vicious smiles to have ever evolved, its hard to beat the grin of the aptly named Smilodon. The largest of these Ice Age cats sported canines that were 11 inches long, with fine serrations giving the fangs even more of a cutting edge. Yet despite the fact that this felid\u00a0has been famous for its dental cutlery ever since the early 19th century, paleontologists are still trying to figure out just how it used its impressive teeth. How do you bite when you have an excess of tooth?\n\nTheres no shortage of ideas about what Smilodon did with its ludicrously long fangs. The 19th century paleontologists Richard Owen and Edward Drinker Cope, for example, both suggested that Smilodon was a living can opener, those teeth being an adaptation to cut\u00a0through the tough and often armored hides of giant sloths and huge armadillos. Other experts, such as paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson, proposed that Smilodon used them to slash or stab. It was even suggested that the palate of the great sabercat suggested a propensity for sucking, painting\u00a0Smilodon\u00a0as a sort of\u00a0Ice Age vampire.\n\nSadly, there are no living Smilodon to studythe last of these cats died out about 8,000 years agoand the humans who undoubtedly saw them did not think to carefully document their feeding habits. On top of that, todays big cats arent very helpful as analogs. Lions, for example, have shorter, conical teeth and use throttling bites to clamp around the throats of large prey, clamping down the windpipe. This option wasnt open to Smilodon. But thanks to reinvestigations of old bones and high tech analysis, paleontologists are finally starting to get a handle on how Smilodon employed those terrible teeth.  \nPart of the answer is to stop thinking just about teeth and jaws. With an anatomists eye, various aspects of the\u00a0Smilodon\u00a0skull jump into focus as different from those of their living feline cousins. The back and base of sabercat skulls tend to show very expanded and bulky bony areas for the attachment of large neck muscles, says Zhijie Jack Tseng, a paleontologist at the State University of New York at Buffalo, leading some researchers to suggest that prey killing involved significant contribution of neck power. A 2007 study by Colin McHenry and colleagues, for example, found that\u00a0Smilodon\u00a0had a bite only about\u00a0a third as powerful as a lions, yet the fossil feline had bulky neck muscles that would have aided a quick killing stroke.\n\nHaving saberteeth wouldnt be of much benefit without a jaw able to open extraordinarily wide.\u00a0Thats why many sabercats also have modified lower jaw joints that allowed the jaws to swing open to clear\u00a0those fangs,\u00a0Tseng says. And looking beyond the skull and neck,\u00a0Smilodon\u00a0also had exceptionally muscular arms. Taken together, says Des Moines University paleontologist Julie Meachen, its likely that Smilodon\u00a0used its very muscular neck and forearms to assist in the kill bite.\n\nKeeping prey pinned down was critical to the process. Compared to todays lions and tigers, Tseng says, the thin sabers suggest that, whatever the killing behavior, it was more important for\u00a0Smilodon\u00a0to keep the prey immobilized long enough to use the sabers so they dont bend sideways in the direction of weakness. This risk isnt just theoretical Rare specimens of\u00a0Smilodon\u00a0from the La Brea asphalt and other sites bear broken fangs.\n\nEnvisioning how\u00a0Smilodon\u00a0killed the horses and camels of its time, then, is not just about the bite.\u00a0Smilodon\u00a0didnt have the proportions of a fast running cat, Meachen says, meaning that the beast probably would stalk its prey from a hidden position, then leap out at prey and knock it off balance using its weight. The arms came into play at this moment, grappling and pinning the victim as the cat got ready to inflict the fatal blow. Here, however, we hit a freeze frame theres still some uncertainty about how\u00a0Smilodon\u00a0would have best employed its teeth. Either Smilodon would rip out the preys throat, Meachen says, or it would make a precise killing bite, severing the carotid artery and then it would remove its teeth and start eating. Either way, it would have been a huge mess. Naturally,\u00a0Smilodon\u00a0wasnt the only sabertooth around. The cat was among the last, the largest andthanks to the thousands of bones pulled from the asphalt of La Breabest known, but sabertoothed carnives have evolved over and over again throughout the history of life. Looking at the filiform side of the carnivoran family tree alone, sabertooths evolved at least three times both the true sabercats and two lineages of false sabercats called\u00a0nimravids\u00a0and barbourofelids. This raises the question of whether sabercats may one day make a comeback. Some point to the clouded leopard of Asia has sometimes as having the potential to become the next sabertooth. The\u00a0cats canines\u00a0are long for its size perhaps, over time and with the right evolutionary nudging, the clouded leopard or another cat could take\u00a0Smilodons\u00a0place. Whether that ever happens, though, depends on the fate of todays felids Clouded leopards are currently listed as vulnerable on the\u00a0IUCNs Red List of Threatened Species.  I think its possible, hypothetically in an ideal world, that a new sabercat could evolve, Meachen says.\u00a0But I think in the real word, most carnivores will become extinct due to habitat loss, hunting and climate change. If were ever going to see sabercats return, well have to safeguard the imperiled cats around us today."}, {"title": "The Real Reason the Turtle Learned to Hide its Head Will Surprise You", "author": "Ben Panko", "date": "February 21, 2017", "doc": "Sixty five years ago, at the height of the Cold War, the U.S. government released a short animated film about what Americans should do in the event of a nuclear attack. The film featured as its protagonist perhaps the most famous example of an animal with a tendency to duck and cover the wary, protective turtle.\u00a0 It may not be the giraffes slender leaf picker or the owls elastic head spinner, but the turtles retractable neck is nothing to scoff at. When danger strikes, turtles use their flexible necks to retract\u00a0their heads safely inside their shield like shells. Evolutionary researchers have long assumed that turtles developed this trick as protection against predators, but new research suggests that its original purpose\u00a0was likely not defense, but food. Platychelys oberndorferi was a species of turtle that lived in central Europe roughly 150 million years ago, just a few million years after turtles evolved. It measured roughly 1 to 2 feet in length, and likely made its home in the wetlands and lakes of the warm Jurassic earth. However, the similarities to the majority of modern turtles end there, according to Jurassica Museum paleontologist J\u00e9r\u00e9my Anquetin, lead author of a study published yesterday in the journal Scientific Reports. This Jurassic turtle is actually very bizarre when you look at it, says Anquetin, referring to a shell made up of sharp knobs and a wide skull with eyes close to the nose. P. oberndorferi fossils are rare Anquetin says he and his team came upon the fossil used in their study by chance, when a specimen from 1862 was returned to a museum in Basel, Switzerland, from New York. Most fortuitiously, this fossil happened to have the delicate bones of the turtles vertebrae preserved, giving the team an opportunity to compare its skeletal system to turtles of today. Modern turtles are divided into two broad groups based on how they retract their necks pleurodires, which turn their necks to pull their heads into their shells sideways, and cryptodires, which pull their heads straight back into their shells. Pleurodires appear to have\u00a0evolved more than 200 million years ago, with cryptodires branching off around 165 million years ago. Based on the shape of its skull and its number of vertebrae, P. oberndorferi has long been classified as a pleurodire. But when Anquetin and his collaborators modeled the extinct turtles vertebrae, and found something puzzling. They were shaped as they should be in a different group of turtles, Anquetin says, referring to the cryptodire like vertebrae. We didnt expect to find anything like that. P. oberndorferis vertebrae were shaped to allow the turtle to partially pull its head straight back into its shellnot to the side, like pleurodires. The partial part is key, says Anquetin. Partial retraction of the head provides no protective benefits, as a predator could easily reach and attack the turtles curled, vulnerable\u00a0head. So the idea that this kind of head retraction could have evolved for defense didnt make sense. This had to evolve for a reason, Anquetin says. We started to look for a reason. A clue came in the form of two modern day doppelgangers of P. oberndorferiNew Zealands mata mata turtles and North Americas snapping turtles, which both also have the spiked shells found on P. oberndorferi. These turtles evolved independently of each other on opposite sides of the world. And yet both use their neck retraction abilities not only for protection, but also for hunting. They represent an example of convergent evolutiontwo unrelated species evolving the same behavior or physical trait. Turtles may be stereotyped as slow, herbivorous creatures, but these two species launch their necks violently forward to attack prey. Similarly, the snapping turtle infamously lunges forward to capture small fish with the snap of its powerful jaws. To gain momentum and surprise their victims, the two species will launch their retracted heads from within their shells. Anquetin suspects that P. oberndorferi is a case of the early evolution of this ability. Since partial retraction wouldnt help this turtle protect itself, it makes much more sense that it developed the trait for hunting others. Being able to partially retract their necks like P. oberndorferi would let them strike at prey with more force. This would make sense for the evolution of neck retraction in other modern cryptodires too, Anquetin adds. Evolution often works to co opt features that evolved for one purpose for a drastically different one, in a process known as exapation. For instance, says Tyler Lyson, vertebrate paleontology curator at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,\u00a0bird feathers were originally used to regulate body temperature, but later came to play a critical role in flying.\u00a0 Similarly, the added benefit of turtle neck retraction for defense then likely evolved from this partial point, Anquetin says. Because of the significant physical changes required to allow a turtle to fully retract its neck, the process of evolving that ability likely took a very long time. They cannot appear in one night, he says. Brad Shaffer, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California at\u00a0Los Angeles,\u00a0thinks Anquetin and his collaborators are pushing the envelope a bit with their confidence in their hypothesis. In particular, Shaffer says hes unsure about the amount of\u00a0extrapolation from a partial fossil required to reach a conclusion in this study.\n\nGiven that there are only two neck vertebrae, theyre doing an awful lot of reconstructing,\u00a0says\u00a0Shaffer, who was not involved in the new study. However, he adds that\u00a0the theory will hopefully spark more discussion in the field of turtle research, and that it advances the debate among researchers on how rigid the boundary between pleurodires and crytodires turtles really is. Those early turtlesthey were experimenting a bit, Shaffer says.\u00a0 With such a limited pool of well preserved early turtle fossils, Anquetin says he doesnt expect to be able to do many studies on this aspect of turtle evolution again. But he predicts that biologists will now be able to study the different feeding behaviors of modern turtles and see how their neck anatomies compare. Shaffer agrees that analyses of how turtles use neck retraction across the turtle tree of life\u00a0will help paint a better picture of how this trait evolved. There must be another explanation than protection at the beginning, Anquetin says. People will have to investigate now."}, {"title": "This Ancient Reptile Gave Birth to Live Offspring", "author": "Swapna Krishna", "date": "February 16, 2017", "doc": "Roughly 245 million years ago, the long necked Dinocephalosaurus dominated the China Sea. Nearly the size of a Siberian tiger, these creatures swept through\u00a0the oceans long before dinosaurs roamed the earth.  Scientists have long thought that these creatures all laid eggs like their\u00a0modern birds and crocodile relatives. But as Ben Guarino reports for the Washington Post, a new study suggests that\u00a0Dinocephalosaurus went about babies a different way They gave birth to live offspring.  The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, documents a puzzling fossil that researchers discovered in Chinas Luoping Biota National Geoparka site that is home to many exceptionally well preserved specimen. Researchers, however, were initially unsure what they had, reports Guarino.  I was not sure if the embryonic specimen was the last lunch of the mother or its unborn baby, Jun Liu, a paleontologist at the Hefei University of Technology in China, told Guarino. Upon closer inspection and searching the literature, I realized that something unusual had been discovered.  Upon inspection the scientists discovered that they had found a baby dino still inside its mama. But to confirm the find was no easy task with the scant number of bones available, reports Guarino.  The scientists used the structure of the skeleton to confirm the tiny dino and massive creature were the same species. Its unlikely that they were vaguely similar species because, according to Liu and his team, as far as scientists know, none existed at the time in the China Sea. They estimated that the smaller animal is about 12 percent the size of the adult.  Using the position of the smaller animal, writes Paul Rincon at the BBC, Liu and his team also ruled out that the smaller fossil was Dinocephalosaurus last meal. Predators normally swallow their prey headfirst, which helps the \u00a0prey travel down to the stomach more easily. As a result, meals face backwards within the stomach of animals. However, the smaller animal was facing forwards within Dinocephalosaurus.  The crucial piece of the puzzle was the posture of the embryo It was in a curled position. This is the typical situation for vertebrates, Liu tells Guarino.  Its still possible that the embryo was encased within an egg, and that the shell didnt survive, says paper co author Mike Benton from the University of Bristol to Rincon. But with the advanced development of the embryo, the team concluded that the live birth was most likely.  This discovery has wide ranging implications for the entire Archosauromorpha family, of which Dinocephalosaurus is a member. Scientists will be studying both new fossils and old for more evidence that live birth was possible for multiple members of the species."}, {"title": "Mary Leakey\u2019s Husband (Sort of) Took Credit For Her Groundbreaking Work On Humanity\u2019s Origins", "author": "Kat Eschner", "date": "February 6, 2017", "doc": "When it came to finding humanitys ancestors, Mary Leakey had no parallel.  Born on this day in 1913, Leakey did so much to advance the study of ancient humans that she has been called the woman who found our ancestors. Working with her husband, famous paleoanthropologist Louis Leakey, and then with her own team, she advanced humanitys knowledge of our origins. \u00a0 What happened next is a familiar story in the history of STEM although Mary did a lot of the work  the fieldwork, that is  Louis got a lot of the credit. Although Louis grabbed the headlines, it was his second wife, Mary, an archaeologist, who made many of the actual finds associated with the Leakey name, wrote Roger Lewin for Smithsonian Magazine in 2002. Until later in their relationship, when their marital ties all but snapped for both personal and professional reasons, she let her husband bask in the limelight while she conducted her beloved fieldwork. And what fieldwork it was. Writing for The Christian Science Monitor, Steph Solis described what Leakey is known for a ... skull that was proven to be a prehistoric ape ancestor, another that dated back to an unprecedented 1.75 million years and fossil footprints of prehistoric hominids. But for a long time it was Louis, not Mary, who traveled to the United States to lecture, raise money and speculate at news conferences about the significance of his wifes discoveries, often leaving the impression that he, personally had made the finds, wrote Bart Barnes for The Washington Post. According to Solis, some historians think that Leakey didnt mind. She was a strong woman who neither resented her husband for being in the spotlight in fact, she preferred it that way, nor felt threatened by her male counterparts, Solis writes. And because she hated publicity, Barnes writes, she did not object to Louiss activities. \u00a0 Its worth remembering that Mary Leakey wasnt university educated and got her start as an illustrator on archaeological digs like the one where she first met Louis. And that Louis Leakey was already a Cambridge University professor with an established reputation for fieldwork in East Africa, according to Barnes, when he left his pregnant first wife to marry Mary, who was in her early twenties. Mary Leakey, ne\u00e9 Nicol,\u00a0was talented, but she probably wasnt sure how to play the game of academia, particularly in a field as fraught with intense differences of interpretation as paleoanthropology, which requires practitioners to form extended arguments off a few remaining physical clues about our ancient ancestors.\u00a0 As for whether Leakey minded or not, if she didnt at first, she sure began to as her marriage to Louis crumbled. At the same time, she started to take more credit for her own work, and received accolades.\u00a0Leakey eventually left Louis  partially, Lewin writes, because of a dodgy claim he was making about an artifact  \u00a0although she kept the name she had helped make so famous in scientific circles. Her son with Louis, Richard Leakey, is also a paleoanthropologist responsible for numerous finds, although his wife Meave Leakey\u00a0has done more recent important work in the field. \u00a0 In recent times, Leakey has gotten more credit for her groundbreaking work.\u00a0She got her own Google Doodle in 2013. After Louiss death of a heart attack in 1972, she went on to lead a team in the discovery of hominid footprints that were dated at 3.6 million years old, at the time the oldest evidence of human ancestors that had been found. The Laetoli footprints were important because they demonstrated decisively that hominids were walking on two legs rather than four at that point in their evolution, wrote Neville Agnew and Martha Demas for The Getty Conservation Institute. Mary Leakey wrote this about her discovery, Agnew and Demas write, talking of one of the hominids who made the trail At one point, and you need not be an expert tracker to discern this, she stops, pauses, turns to the left to glance at some possible threat or irregularity, and then continues to the north.

But for paleontologists, theres a deeper lesson here Far from being an anomaly, SK 54 represents one of many fossils that may never have made it into the fossil record without the hunger motivated intervention of prehistoric carnivores. By helping themselves to a hot meal, meat eaters assembled a record of our past. The textbook version of fossilization goes something like this. Alive or dead, an organism needs to be rapidly buried. Sand, mud, ashalmost any sediment will do. This geologic blanket keeps the bones safe from scavengers that would otherwise destroy and scatter the remains. Carnivores are thus cast in the role of natural enemies of paleontologists. But, in truth, fossil hunters owe a debt of gratitude to a variety of prehistoric predatorsespecially those who preyed on our own predecessors.\n\nConsider the crocodile. Dozens of schlock horror movies have banked on the terror of being snaffled up by the toothy saurians, but the reptilian ambush predators of Olduvai Gorge actually did paleontologists a valuable service. Back in the days that\u00a0Homo habilis\u00a0was wandering around Tanzania, around 1.8 million years ago, Olduvai was a marshland inhabited by huge, horned crocodiles. Its difficult to say whether these prehistoric giants were able to catch the prehistoric people fresh or scavenged bodies, but a\u00a0Homo habilis\u00a0foot and two leg bones bear crocodile bite marks. This led paleontologist Christopher Brochu and colleagues to name the Olduvai predator\u00a0Crocodylus anthropophagus\u00a0 the human eating crocodile. And while such scenes might be unsettling to envision, those crocodiles dragged human remains into an environment where sediment was being laid down and therefore fossilization could take place. The giant hyenas of Chinas Dragon Bone Hill provided a similar service. While\u00a0Homo erectus\u00a0 famously known of Peking Man upon discovery  are indeed found in the 750,000  200,000 year old sediments of the cave, the most numerous fossils belong to\u00a0Pachycroctua bervirostris\u00a0 a stocky hyena as heavy as a lion. This was their turf, and, according to paleoanthropologist\u00a0Noel Boaz and colleagues, damage to the\u00a0Homo erectus\u00a0bones only reinforces the conclusion.  About 67 percent of\u00a0Homo erectus\u00a0bones found at the site show signs of\u00a0gnawing by large carnivores, and the giant hyena in particular. There are some indications that the\u00a0Homo erectus\u00a0sometimes used the cave as a refuge, their tools and evidence of fire giving away their efforts to hunker down, but the overwhelming signal was that hyenas were bringing the humans back to their den to consume at their leisure. \nIt was a grisly process. After finishing the meat of the body, the hyenas likely ate the easily available muscles on the outside of the skull, Boaz and coauthors proposed, before cracking off the lower jaw to get to the tongue. From there the hyenas may have braced the skulls against the cave floor to\u00a0break open the cranium\u00a0to get the fatty brain inside, a delicacy for the carnivores. Yet while we might wish that\u00a0Pachycrocuta\u00a0were gentler with our ancient relatives, their efforts nevertheless scattered\u00a0Homo erectus\u00a0bones in a place where they could be buried and held safely until discovery. While most of these\u00a0Homo erectus\u00a0bones were later lost in transit  an open mystery of Sherlockian proportions  and only survive today as casts of the originals, they were an international sensation when discovered and were among the richest human bonebeds ever found. Thanks, hyenas.\n\nThe more paleontologists and anthropologists look at the fossil record, the more its apparent that meat eating animals have helped make the fossil record we now study. Owls and other birds of prey, for example, have kept a long running record of small mammals in the pellets they deposit, and crocodylians have been unwittingly contributing to the fossil record for\u00a0over 47 million years. Big cats have had a paw in shaping our view of the past, too. Leopards have been stashing their prey\u00a0in caves\u00a0for millions of years, and, even in recent history, cougars have made enough of a habit of stashing kills in hard to get places that they can sometimes\u00a0confuse archaeologists. Even lions, who were thought to almost never accumulate bones, can sometimes stash\u00a0impressive skeletal assemblages. Carnivore contributions to the fossil record havent stopped. Today, meat eaters in Africa like hyenas, jackals and big cats are all adding to tomorrows fossil record, says says Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History paleoanthropologist Briana. Of these, hyenas are our heroes. The reason why, Pobiner notes, is mainly feeding their babies in their dens, which can be already underground. Its a ready made situation for future fossilization. They may destroy a fair amount of their meals, to be sure, but better to have leftovers than no future fossils at all.\n\nOur helpful carnivore neighbors have done more than just increase the sample size of hominin remains. Theyve also helped anthropologists put us in our place. Early visions of prehistoric people saw them as exceptionally violent and brutish. The damage on SK 54 and on the Dragon Bone Hill humans were originally interpreted to be signs of murder, and even cannibalism. But realizing that early humans were often prey helped usher in a more nuanced vision of our ancestors. These were people struggling to survive while also learning from the carnivores we feared and competed with.\n\nOnce our ancestors stopped cowering in the shadow of predators and stepped into the carnivore guild ourselves, using stone tools to stand in for slicing teeth, they inadvertently started to create a fossilized record of their favorite foodstuffs. The menu has ranged from mammoth to lemurs to seafood, scattered through caves and collected in middens. People creates records of their meals just as carnivores contributed to our own story. Which just goes to show A hominins trash is a paleontologists treasure."}, {"title": "Tiny Cone-Shaped Creature Gets a Twig on the Tree of Life", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "January 12, 2017", "doc": "When researchers first described\u00a0hyoliths roughly 175 years ago, flummoxed paleontologists bestowed them with the Latin moniker\u00a0Incertae sedisthe binomial equivalent of We dont know, writes\u00a0Stepanie\u00a0Pappas at\u00a0Live Science. Where did this strange little creature fit in the tree of life? Now, almost two centuries later scientists may have\u00a0finally have an answer, positioning\u00a0the hyolith on the proper twig in the tree of life. Nicholas St. Fleur at The New York Times reports that\u00a0researchers have debated from the beginning where the hyolith belongs. Less than half an inch long, the tiny extinct creature lived during the Cambrian period 540 million years ago. It resembles a tentacled ice cream cone with a lid, he writes, and has characteristics similar to\u00a0snails or clams but is also very different. It sports a pair of helens, or curved stilts, that likely allowed the creature to prop itself up on the ocean floor to feed. To crack the mystery, Joseph Moysiuk, and undergraduate at the University of Toronto, and his colleagues took a fresh look at 1,500 hyolith fossils from the Burgess Shale in the Canadian Rockies and the Spence Shale, a formation in Idaho and Utah. Pappas reports that 254 of those fossils included impressions of the hyoliths soft tissue, giving the researchers new insights into the structure of the animals. The researchers used a scanning electron microscope and other instruments to test for trace elements on the fossils. Those tests revealed that the hyoliths had tentacled structures coming out of their mouths. A band of tissue protruded from the hyolith lid, and between 12 and 16 tentacles, depending on the exact species, extended off that tissue, Fleur reports. That type of feeding structure is called a lophophore, which is one of the primary organs of a group of creatures called Lophophorata, which includes modern day bryozoaaquatic moss animalsand brachiopods, a group of marine animals with hard shells. Based on these analyses the hyolith, appears to combine characteristics from several modern lophophorata groups, reports Pappas. The creature has a shell like a brachiopod and has a tubular body similar to a group called phoronids or horseshoe worms. The hyolith, says Moysiuk, was likely a stationary filter feeder, and is more closely related to brachiopods than molluscs, like clams. We suggest that hyoliths may be distant cousins of brachiopods who have retained a tubular shaped body from an ancestor they share with phoronids, he tells Pappas. Its adding this new branch to the tree of life. Paleontologist Mark Sutton at Imperial College London tells St. Fleur that the finding finally solves the 175 year old mystery. Finding them with enough soft tissue to actually place them is a major coup, he says. This is the sort of thing that will rewrite textbooksat least the ones that talk about hyoliths. The real star of the show, however, is the Burgess Shale deposit. The area, first discovered in 1909, is still answering questions more than 100 years later about the Cambrian explosion, a period when huge numbers of new life forms, like the hyolith, evolved in the Earths oceans. Who knows what secrets remain buried in this depositjust waiting to be found."}, {"title": "Ancient Teeth Show That Dinosaurs Took a Long Time to Hatch", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "January 3, 2017", "doc": "Dinosaurs werent just super sized reptilesthey were bird like too, with colors and feathers. They may have even been partially warm blooded. But researchers havent been able to figure out one important part of their lifecycle Did dinosaur eggs incubate rapidly, like modern day birds? Or did they follow a more reptilian pattern, taking weeks or even months to hatch? New research in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that when it came to hatching babies, dinosaurs were squarely on the lizard like side of the equation. Researchers examined\u00a0the teeth of dinosaur embryo fossils including Protoceratops, a sheep sized dino collected in Mongolias Gobi Desert, and an embryo of a duck billed Hypacrosaurus, a large dino with eggs the size of volleyballs found in Alberta, Canada, according\u00a0to a\u00a0press release. The team ran the jaws of the embryonic thunder lizards through a CT scanner to get fine detail of the developing teeth. They also examined several of the teeth under the microscope. Growth lines on the teeth revealed that the baby Protoceratops had been in its egg at least three months and the duck billed dino\u00a0was cooped up in its shell for six months. In fact, points out Maddie Stone at Gizmodo, the incubation times could be longer since the embryos died in the shell. These are the lines that are laid down when any animals teeth develops, Gregory Erickson, professor of biological sciences at Florida State University and lead author of the study says in the press release. Theyre kind of like tree rings, but theyre put down daily. We could literally count them to see how long each dinosaur had been developing. The new information upends some ideas about dinosaurs. For instance, the long incubation period means its less likely the creatures migrated. Instead, points out James Gorman at The New York Times, while some dinosaur species buried their eggs and went on their merry way, others likely stuck around to protect their slow developing eggs and babies, which would be a tempting treat for predators. The biggest takeaway, however, is the slow incubation periods impact on dinosaur survival during an extinction event. The slow embryonic development along with the year or so to reach maturity places the lumbering lizards at a disadvantage compared with smaller creatures that could reproduce more quickly after a global catastrophe, like the asteroid or comet that hit the earth, creating the\u00a0Chicxulub\u00a0 crater in present day Mexico, 66 million years ago. Dinos, on the other hand, would have been stuck in one place trying to raise a clutch of eggs under harsh conditions. Having a slow incubation periodthree to six monthswould have exposed eggs to predation, droughts and flooding for long periods of time, Erickson tells Stone. If there were attending parents, you can imagine the parents would have been exposed for long periods of time, too. That long incubation period, combined with climate changes and an asteroid strike or other world changing events could have pushed the dinos over the edge. With regard to their life history and physiological attributes, dinosaurs were basically holding a dead mans hand, Erickson said. They were profligate wasters of energy, which is bad in a resource depleted environment. Some of our work shows that dinosaurs took over a year to reach maturity, he says. You throw in very slow incubation times on top of that, and these attributes are collectively a bunch of black eights and aces."}, {"title": "Fossil Footprints Show Movements of Our Early Ancestors", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "December 15, 2016", "doc": "In 1978, researchers in Laetoli, Tanzania, found an 88 foot long trail of preserved footprints. The 3.6 million year old imprints included 70 impressions from two ape like early human ancestors, likely Australopithecus afarensis, and are the earliest set of bipedal footprints ever discovered. Now, researchers assessing the area of the famous tracks for a proposed museum have discovered another large set of bipedal prints, reports Helen Briggs at the BBC. The new fossil prints, as well as the previously discovered tracks, were formed when the early hominids walked across a stretch of wet volcanic ash that hardened into a clay like material, preserving the impressions. Ian Sample at The Guardian reports that preliminary analysis of the prints indicates that the newly found 90 foot stretch of tracks were made by a male, three females and a child walking as a group through the ash. The largest footprints in the group show that the male Australopithicus likely stood five feet, five inches tall, making him the largest member of the species ever recorded, Sample reports. Lucy, the famous skeleton and first member of the species found, for instance, was only around\u00a03.6 feet tall. The composition of the group also adds to our scant knowledge of the species behavior. A tentative conclusion is that the group consisted of one male, two or three females, and one or two juveniles, which leads us to believe that the maleand therefore other males in the specieshad more than one female mate, Marco Cherin, director of the school of paleoanthropology at the University of Perugia, tells Briggs. That may mean the social structure of the species may have resembled apes, such as gorillas, where a dominant male and several females from one child rearing unit. We are far from the traditional representation of the 1970s, with a couple of human like Australopithecus, romantically walking arm in arm, Giorgio Manzi, of Italys Sapienza University of Rome and a co author of a study on the footprints in the journal eLife tells Michael Greshko at National Geograhpic. This old representation is probably misleading. But not everybody is comfortable with the teams interpretation of the footprints, or the extrapolation that one of the creatures was so large. The size variation they report has no bearing on sexual dimorphism, since we dont know the age of any of the footprint makers, Kent States Owen Lovejoy, who worked on the original Lucy fossil, tells Greshko. The suggestion that somehow these five prints suggest a gorilla like sexual strategy iswell, let me put it this waynuts. Its not the only controversy that has cropped up surrounding Australopithcus this year. Sample points out that researchers reanalyzing Lucys bones concluded that she had fractures consistent with falling out of a tree. Other researchers argued that an animal stampede or many other causes could have caused the breaks post mortem. In November, researchers also argued that Lucys forearms were very strong for her size, indicating that she likely did spend time in trees. Whatever the case, theres likely to be more information to come from Laetoli. Manzi tells Greshko that the new footprints were found in three small trenches and future excavations may reveal many more remnants of the hominids who once passed that way."}, {"title": "Construction Workers Uncover Ancient Elephant Bones Under L.A.\u2019s Subway", "author": "Danny Lewis", "date": "December 5, 2016", "doc": "Ten thousand years ago, the land where Los Angeles now stands\u00a0was blanketed with tar pits, snagging all sorts of unsuspecting creatures and entombing them in its gooey depths. So it didnt come as too big of a surprise when construction workers at the site of L.A.\u00a0Subways future\u00a0WilshireLa Brea Station came across fragments from an ancient elephant,\u00a0Brittny Mejia reports for the\u00a0Los Angeles Times. Considering how well known the La Brea Tar Pits are, the crew was prepared for the possibility of uncovering prehistoric creatures. Just after Thanksgiving, the team found a set of teeth belonging to an adult mastodon, prompting officials\u00a0to call a\u00a0paleontological monitor to watch for other creature remains. Shortly thereafter, the monitor uncovered a partial skull with tusks from\u00a0not far away from where the first specimens were found,\u00a0Sarah Laskow reports for\u00a0Atlas Obscura. When such finds are made, construction work is immediately stopped in the area until the fossils can be preserved and removed, Metro spokesman Dave Sotero wrote\u00a0in a statement.  Preliminary analysis of the ancient elephant bones suggest that the creature lived at least 10,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age. But while the first set of teeth fragments the workers uncovered appear to be from a mastodon, its unclear whether the second set of fossils belonged to a mastodon or a young mammoth,\u00a0Hudson Hongo writes for\u00a0Gizmodo. Both the tusk section and skull have been encased in plastersimilar to that used in making casts for humansin order to be removed from the site intact and taken to a lab for further analysis, Sotero writes. An analysis of the teeth and other features of the skull will tell whether the animal was a mammoth or mastodon.  Both beasts were distant cousins of the modern elephants, but they are not one and the same. Mammoths were much larger than mastodons and had tall, ridged teeth that could stand up to the wear and tear of eating tough plains grasses. Mastodons, on the other hand, tended to stick to the forests and snacked on fruit and leaves, Sotero writes. Both species went extinct at about the same time, around 10,000 years ago. Though these were the first fossil findings during the Metros expansion, they are unlikely to the be last. When the subway systems Red Line was being built in the 1980s, workers uncovered thousands of fossil specimens, and funding for retrieving them safely has been worked into the current budget.

Just look at the blue whale The largest animal on the planet, this ravenous creature can scarf down over 457,000 calories in a single mouthful, straining seawater through its mouth to catch krill and other tasty little morsels. But how did these ocean giants evolve their impressively efficient if not exactly well mannered method of slurping up huge mouthfuls of tiny prey?  A recently discovered fossil whale presents an unexpected answer Early baleen whales sucked. Thats no disrespect intended to whale ancestors. Even though todays baleen whaleswhich include blue whales, humpback whales and minke whalesget their family name from the peculiar array of bristles that allow them to filter food out of the water, the earliest members of their family actually had mouths filled with teeth. The 25 million year old Janjucetus, for example, had a sharp smile of recurved choppers without a trace of baleen to be seen.  Later members of the same group, known as mysticetes, may have had a mixture of teeth and tufts of baleen. Baleen, by the way, is made of keratin, the tough protein found in fingernails, hair and ant exoskeletons. Even though the baleen itself hasnt been found in the oldest fossil whales, like the 23 million year old species of Aetiocetus, clues such as blood vessel openings on the rooves of their mouths have led researchers to hypothesize its presence. Drawing from these fossils, paleontologists proposed two scenarios for how mysticetes may have switched from teeth to baleen, says paleontologist Erich Fitzgerald of the Museum Victoria.  One idea was that the ancestors of todays baleen whales had interlocking teeth, which they used to strain small fish out of the water, as crabeater seals do today. Yet theres no solid evidence to suggest that whales like Janjucetus did this. The possible tooth and baleen mixture in Aetiocetus seemed a more likely option, with baleen becoming more and more important to catching little tidbits through time, but Fitzgerald points out that no one has yet found conclusive evidence that Aetiocetus had baleen. Seals and other marine mammals have similar openings on the rooves of their mouths, even though they lack baleen. When, why and how baleen whales evolved the distinctive bristles that give them their name remained unclear.  Enter Alfred. Thats the name of a 25 million year old whale found along Washingtons Olympic Peninsula in 2004. It got its nickname, Fitzgerald says, simply because colleague Felix Marx thought Alfred was a fitting title for the new aetiocetid. But even though Alfred doesnt yet have an official scientific moniker, Fitzgerald could see that it was something special even before the whale had fully emerged from the stone that encased it.\n\nAlfreds teeth were preserved loose in soft sediment alongside the skull, Fitzgerald says, and as we were disaggregating blocks of sediment in buckets of hot water, some teeth dropped out to the bottom of the bucket. Fitzgerald could immediately tell there was something odd going on \u00a0one tooth had horizontal scratch marks along the crown. Museum Victoria lab technician Tim Ziegler soon found other examples during the preparation process, Fitzgerald says, all with telltale scratches on the tongue side of the teeth.  Fitzgerald had seen this before. Modern walrus show similar dental damage from scraping sediment along their teeth as they move their tongues back and forth to suck prey into their mouths. In that moment of insight, Fitzgerald says, the team realized that we could have direct evidence of suction feeding behavior in this ancient baleen whale. The researchers report their results in a\u00a0new\u00a0Memoirs of Museum Victoria\u00a0study.\n\nFitzgerald had raised the possibility that another ancient mysticete, called\u00a0Mammalodon,\u00a0might have nabbed lunch by suction. But, he says, Alfreds scratched teeth are the smoking gun of suction feeding. This ancient whale flung open its toothy jaws to create a little vacuum, drawing in prey as well as sedimentjust as toothed whales like belugas do today. Our team suspects that other aetiocetids, perhaps all aetiocetids, were suction feeders, Fitzgerald says, but it is only Alfred that has preserved the rare clinching evidence for this prey capture method.\n\nAlfred opens a new possibility for how whales lost their teeth. In short, teeth would have only gotten in the way. Ancient toothed baleen whales first became suction feeders, Fitzgerald says, which resulted in a reduced need for teeth to bite prey, and paved the way for loss of teeth and the modification of gums to form a baleen filter for prey that was sucked in to the mouth.\u00a0Teeth could have acted as a simple sieve to start. But a curtain of baleen would have been even better, starting these whales on their path to delicately sifting the seas."}, {"title": "Preserve and Protect: How Paleontologists Care for Their Long-Dead, High-Maintenance Stars", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "November 14, 2016", "doc": "How do you take care of a superstar whos been dead for over 66 million years? Thats a question that William Simpson, the paleontology collections manager at Chicagos Field Museum, faces nearly every day.\n\nSimpsons most high profile star, Sue, is arguably the most famous Tyrannosaurus rex ever found. The majority of the tryants skeleton is reconstructed in the lobby of the Field. But Sue more than a beloved showpiece. This dinosaur is also an essential part of the Fields scientific collection, where its primary importance is what it can teach us about its long lost species. Sues\u00a0visitors arent just the adoring public, but researchers who need to get up close and personal with the predators bones to unlock their mysteries.\n\nWith that in mind, the Field took great care when putting the dinosaur back together. Sue, Simpson says, is mounted in such a way that every bone can come off the mount without taking the entire mount apart. That recently came in handy for researchers. Just this month we took Sues right arm off the mount for high powered CT scanning at the synchrotron at Argonne National Labs. Thats not exactly the stereotyped image of what goes on with museum collections.  In the popular imagination, museum collections conjure images of the vast warehouse at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark, where a lone custodian rolls a precious artefact among row upon row of crates, only to be forgotten. Paleontologists wish that such views would go extinct. The perception of dark and dusty is a Hollywood clich\u00e9, says Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History curator Hans Dieter Sues. Museums carefully plan how to care for their specimensfrom climate control to pest managementall because these places are where new science is unfolding. The reality is that collections, on display or tucked away behind the scenes, are places of near constant activity where paleontologists treat their long dead charges with care and respect. For instance, the La Brea Tar Pits and Museum. The fossil collections at La Brea are far from forgotten, says collections manager Aisling Farrell. We get visiting researchers from all over the world who come to examine, measure, photograph, and surface scan and document their particular interest.\u00a0Thousands of fossils have come out of the famous asphalt seepsfrom American lion skeletons to specimens as delicate as leafcutter bees still snug in their nestand these form the basis of a constantly churning research program, not to mention the fossils that go out on loan to institutions elsewhere. Simpson\u00a0of the Field Museum puts it this way\u00a0Our Vertebrate\u00a0Paleo collection, like all the collections at the Field Museum, is a library, he says, but instead of books, it consists of vertebrate fossils which represent a vast library of data about the evolution of vertebrates. All those fossilsfrom fish to reptiles to dinosaurs to mammalsrepresent decades of exploration, Simpson says, feeding research at the museum as well as other institutions in the form of over 400 loans to outside researchers. Fossil collections are where the science of paleontology truly lives. Each collection comes with its own challenges. Sometimes its a matter of sheer size\u00a0The National Museum of Natural History, Sues says, has the unique challenge of having a wide range of collections totaling over 147 million specimensfrom dinosaurs to preserved plants to cultural artefacts. Further complicating things, the care each specimen requires can vastly differ from one to the next. At La Brea, everything from itty bitty lizard jaws to mammoth bones have to be documented and categorized, each piece tagged with complicated documentation to make sure researchers know exactly where every fossillarge or smalloriginated. Fortunately, Farrell says, the fossils are really well preserved, and once the surface has been cleaned with a solvent and dried, they can be stored in drawers for decades.\n\nOther challenges are common to all collections. Backlogs are a running concern, Simpson says. When we go out in the field we often collect more specimens than we can process, he points out. Its labor intensive to free fossils of their surrounding rock, catalog them in a database, write catalog numbers of the fossil, make archival labels, photograph them\u00a0and find a place for them in collections. It may not be\u00a0as romantic as fieldwork printing labels doesnt quite compete with visions of sunburnt paleontologists prospecting desert outcrops for fossils\u00a0but its essential if those pieces of the past are ever going to teach us anything.\n\nJust this summer we carried out what we call a Swat Team project, Simpson says. Thats when the Field brings in an outside expert to identify mystery fossils in the collections. In this case,\u00a0the museum was left with a 50 year old collection of mammal bones from cave deposits in Australia that hadnt been fully identified. Paleontologist Bill Turnbull, who had collected the bones, had passed away before the work was done. So the Field put paleomammalogist Matt McDowell to the task and hired five interns to process the fossils identified by McDowell. The end result\u00a011,098 new fossils cataloged and added to the collections.  All of this is critical for research. A jumble of dusty bones would just be a quagmire. Science relies on carefully categorized museum collections, which require\u00a0knowing what a fossil is, where it came from\u00a0and where to find it in the rows upon rows of other specimens. Paleontologists make new discoveries in museum collections all the time, Farrell says, including new species that previously went unrecognized. This past August, Smithsonian researchers announced that they had identified a\u00a0strange new species of extinct river dolphin\u00a0hiding within their own collections.\n\nToday theres an even greater push to throw open collections to more people than have ever seen them before. As part of our collections management in the 21st\u00a0century, we are actively digitizing our specimens,\u00a0Farrell says. This will eventually mean that research questions, education\u00a0and engagement are just a click away. Still, as Sues notes, digitization can only take us so far. For a fossil to be digitized at all, the original specimen has to be carefully and properly cared looked after, forming the core of what a museum is. Even though many may treat museums as exhibit spaces, the true heart of any museum is in its collections.\u00a0Nothing can replace the original evidence for past life when asking questions about the future of life on our planet, Farrell says. Among the rows\u00a0of fossils, collections managers, paleontologists\u00a0and volunteers are working constantly to make sure that rock record has a very long afterlife. Considering fossils as natures books, Simpson says We best keep the books in our libraries in good shape, so that they can be read now and forever."}, {"title": "Fossilized Dinos Are Bones Turned to Stone\u2014But Sometimes, Part of the Original Dino Survives", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "November 9, 2016", "doc": "Everyone learns in school that that dinosaur skeletons are bones turned to stone. Mineral rich water percolated through the earthly remains of the ancient reptiles, transforming their osteology into something much harder over time. But over the past decade, paleontologists have begun to realize what everyone knows isnt quite right. Every skeleton fossilizes a little differently, and, in special circumstances, some of the original biological tidbits of ancient dinosaurs can withstand millions upon millions of years. \nThe first such find was announced back in 2005, when biologist Mary Schweitzer and colleagues announced that they had found the remnants of blood vessels and other soft tissues in the femur of a Tyrannosaurus. At the time, the announcement was controversial no one expected that such tissues could last so long. But over the following decade, Schweitzer and others have built a convincing case that dinosaur bones are not wholly stone, but to varying degrees retain some of the original tissues that grew when the animal was alive. \u00a0  Now, paleontologists have identified an even more surprising substance frozen in time The claw of a famous skeleton, its original material still intact. Its another sign that the fossil record is capable of preserving far more than previous generations of paleontologists ever expectedincluding the potential to offer a spate of new clues about dinosaur biology. \u00a0\u00a0 \nDrexel University paleontologist Alison Moyer, working with colleagues Wenxia Zheng and Schweitzer, announce the find today in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. The fossil under the microscope was a skeleton of a roughly emu sized, parrot like dinosaur called Citipati that had been found perched atop a nest of eggs. Paleontologists know it affectionately as Big Mama. And while the image of a dinosaur brooding its unborn young presents a bittersweet moment caught in time, theres something else remarkable about Big Mama as well the dinosaurs preservation. At the tips of the fingers appear to be remnants of the tough sheath that once covered the dinosaurs claws.\n\nMoyer had been studying beta keratinthe tough protein common to reptilian skin and claws  as part of her PhD research in Schweitzers lab. Mary told me she had a sample of it and never got around to analyzing it, Moyer says. Knowing how beautifully preserved Big Mama is, Moyer decided to set about seeing whether there might be any original material left in those curved claws.\n\nMoyer and colleagues analyzed the claw by comparing its microscopic structure to those of living birds, as well as using microbiological techniques to test for the presence of beta keratin. They found that the long dead dinosaurs claw had a similar structure and biological makeup as those of living, avian dinosaurs. Remarkably, some of the original proteins are still present after over 75 million years.\n\nSo does this discovery mean well soon be getting Jurassic Park? Sadly, no. These are remnants of long lived proteins, not DNA, which decays at such a rate that even in the best circumstances tatters of genes can only last about 6.8 million years before being completely obliterated. Nevertheless, Moyer points out, the discovery underscores that exceptional circumstances can preserve dinosaur biology to a microscopic levels of detail that are only just now being appreciated.\n\nThe animal was obviously buried very rapidly in a sand dune event, as indicated by its death position sitting on a nest of unhatched eggs, Moyer says. This shielded Big Mamas body from scavengers and the harsh outside world. High levels of calcium in the claw, Moyer says, suggests this mineral maybe have helped the preservation of the proteins insidea happenstance that allowed Big Mama to come to us in such high fidelity. This adds to the growing body of evidence that soft tissues and biomolecules preserve over time, Moyer says, not just in bone but other structures as well.  Multiple lines of evidencefrom anatomy you can see with the naked eye to biomolecular signaturesare reiterating that theres more to dinosaur bones than we ever knew. Paleontologists havent yet come across soft organs or skin, but they could be out there, waiting in the rock. The task is to go find them, Moyer says. We dont know if or what is preserved unless we look."}, {"title": "Aboriginal Australians Lived In Country\u2019s Interior 10,000 Years Earlier Than Thought", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "November 3, 2016", "doc": "One of the biggest discoveries in Australian archaeology, like so many discoveries, happened on accident. Or rather it\u00a0might be more accurate to say this discovery happened in pursuit of preventing an accident. Giles Hamm, a Ph.D. student at LaTrobe University and local Adnyamathanha aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard were surveying gorges in the Flinders Range of southern Australia when they had to stop\u00a0for a roadside pee\u00a0break. Nature called and Cliff walked up this creek bed into this gorge and found this amazing spring surrounded by rock art, Hamm tells Dani Cooper at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He also noticed a nearby rock shelter with a blackened roof, a sign of human habitation, about 65 feet above the spring. A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre history. They knew the rock shelter, which they named Warratyi, was significant. But it took nine years of excavation to find out just how important.\u00a0It turns out humans inhabited the site around 49,000 years ago, pushing back the timeline of human colonization of the Australian interior by 10,000 years. The research appears in the journal Nature. Marcus Strom at the Sydney Morning Herald reports that Hamm and his colleagues excavated 3.3 cubic meters of dirt, which contained 4,300 human artifacts and about 6.6 pounds of bones, 70 percent of which came from the yellow footed rock wallaby. Using carbon dating, Giles built up a timeline of how often humans used the rock shelter over the course of 50,000 years. The research showed that usage spiked around 40,000 years ago, then diminished 35,000 years ago when the region became very arid. People returned about 17,000 years ago. What is different about it is its the southern most oldest site in the continent, Hamm says in a press release. It shows that people are moving very quickly around the continent and in the interior part of the continent. If people are coming in at 50,000 years ago, it means that people are moving in a whole range of directions perhaps. And weve got some new genetic evidence that might be also adding data to that question. But the age of the shelter is not the only surprise. Nicola Davis at The Guardian reports the team discovered bones from Diprotodon optatum, a huge, long extinct wombat like marsupial in the cave. It shows that humans likely hunted giant megafauna in the region, since it would have been almost impossible for the giant creature to climb up to the cave on its own. The discovery of red ochre and gypsum, used to color the skin and for ceremonies, as well as relatively sophisticated bone and stone tools upsets some ideas about the spread of those cultural items. The old idea is that people might have come from the East, from the Levant, out of Africa, and these modern humans may have come with a package of innovative technologies, Hamm tells Davis. But the development of these fine stone tools, the bone technology, we think that happened as a local innovation, due to a local cultural evolution. Not everyone is convinced by the research. The dates are deeply anomalous and either they stem from an analytical problem or else they reveal a revolutionary shift in the chronology for ancient Australia, Peter Hiscock, professor of Australian archaeology at the University of Sydney tells Davis. Further scientific study must explore which is the most reasonable explanation. Coulthard tells Strom the discovery wasnt a great surprise to him. Our old people know weve been here a long time, he says."}, {"title": " 133-Million-Year-Old Pebble Discovered to Be First Fossilized Dinosaur Brain", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "October 28, 2016", "doc": "Jamie Hiscocks is a veteran fossil hunter. So spotting a\u00a0small\u00a0unusual pebble on the beach one night in\u00a0Bexhill of Sussex County, England, gave him pause. I could see in my torchlight structured detail on the surface of the object, he tells Brian Resnick at Vox. Immediately I knew this wasnt any ordinary pebble. In fact, it wasnt\u00a0a pebble at all. When he showed the lump of rock to a paleobiologist at Oxford University he eventually identified it as a bit of fossilized dinosaur brain, the first fossil of its kind ever discovered. Nicholas St. Fleur at The New York Times reports that a team of British and Australian researchers conducted a forensic investigation of the fossil, using a scanning electron microscope to get a closer look. They found blood vessels and capillaries, tissue from the cortex, and even evidence of what they believe is the meningesthe protective layer that attaches the brain to the skull. Despite unearthing thousands of dinosaurs over two centuries, researchers have never before encountered a dinosaur brain. Resnick points out that soft tissue in animals breaks down rapidly after they die. Only a tiny fraction of animals are preserved after death in just the right conditions to turn their bodies into fossils. The chances of preserving brain tissue are incredibly small, so the discovery of this specimen is astonishing, Alex Liu of Cambridges Department of Earth Sciences, who co authored the study on the brain fragment that was recently documented\u00a0in a special publication of the\u00a0Geological Society of London, says in a press release. So how did this tiny bit of brain happen to fossilize? Liu tells Resnick that the dinosaur likely died in or near a body of water, falling in head first. Its skull upside down, gravity caused its brain to press against the top of the cranium.\u00a0This limited the amount of oxygen that could reach\u00a0the few millimeters of brain tissue pressing against the skull, preventing decomposition.  As other parts of the brain decomposed, it released iron, phosphate and other enzymes pickling various portions, and within several\u00a0days a combination of chemicals began mineralizing the\u00a0few millimeters of brain that were smushed against the skull. That mineralization led to the formation of the fossil. Eventually, that fossilized brain matter separated and journeyed unknown miles over 133 million years to a tidepool in England. It was pure luck that a winter storm uncovered a bit of beach normally submerged, allowing Hiscocks to discover the strange brain pebble. St. Fleur reports that the brain is believed to come from a large herbivorous dino, like an iguanadon. The fragment itself does not reveal much new information about dinosaurs, and its\u00a0small size does not reveal the larger structure of lobes or tell us how large the complete brain may have been. Paleontologist David Norman, co author of the study, tells St. Fleur the main significance of the fossil is its mere existence. It shows that there is the possibility that fossilized brain matter can exist, which may lead paleontolgists to look more carefully at future fossil discoveries."}, {"title": "Humans May Have Hunted Cave Lions to Extinction\u2014For Throw Rugs", "author": "Rachel Nuwer", "date": "October 26, 2016", "doc": "It turns out safari going bros worried\u00a0about their masculinity arent the only ones who collect animal skin rugs. New research finds that our ancestors may also have had a propensity for advertising their hunting prowess by preserving the furs of their kills. Their prize trophy, however, was no meager lion but a creature called a cave lion. These formidable predators once roamed the forests from Europe to the Canadian Yukon, hunting reindeer,\u00a0goats and now extinct wild cattle. At more than 11 feet long and weighing around 700 pounds, they made todays African lions look like half grown kittens. And, at least to some Upper Paleolithic\u00a0people, they sure must have looked good as rugs.  Sadly, cave lions disappeared from the scene around 14,000 years ago. No one knows exactly why, but researchers have long suspected that man played some role in their demise. That hypothesis now looks even more likely A paper published today in the journal PLOS ONE reports that\u00a0newly discovered cave lion claw bones show signs of being modified by a technique similar to that used by\u00a0modern hunters to skin prey. The new finds suggest\u00a0that humans not only hunted cave lions, but also valued them enough to bling out their homes with the predators full skinclaws and all. The cave lion is a difficult and dangerous animal to hunt, and it probably played an important role as a trophy and for use in rituals, says lead author Mari\u00e1n Cueto, a zooarcheologist at the University of Cantabria in Spain. There are many cases in history in which different societies used carnivore pelts as a symbol of power.  Previously, researchers have found evidence of humans consuming cave lions in the Middle Pleistocene period and of lion teeth being used as ornaments and tools during the Upper Paleolithic. But not much more is known about early hominid interactions with these predators. Cave lion fossils are scarce, and those showing any evidence of human processing even rarer.  The new study was made possible when researchers came across a relative treasure trove of cave lion fossils in the lower gallery of a cavern in northern Spain called La Garma. When you walk into the cave, its like traveling back to a specific moment in our evolution, Cueto says. Its like a time machine. Over 4,000 fossils have been discovered there, many of which bear evidence of human modification.\u00a0But this is the first time anyone has found cave lion remains in La Garma.     The researchers discovered nine claw fossils that belonged to a single cave lion. The fossils all\u00a0bore tell tale scrapes and cuts like those found today when a hunted animals claws have been deliberately kept on its skin. The fossils markings were all quite similar as well, implying that the ancient man or woman who skinned the cat was familiar with cave lion skinning and anatomy. According to radiocarbon dating of the cave, the lion of La Garma, as the team is calling it, lived about 16,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic, making it one of the latest specimens ever discovered. Based on ethnographic analogies and ancient art that links large felines to ritual use, Cueto and her colleagues suspect the skinning process might have taken place in a symbolic context. After removing the skin, the full pelt may have been displayed on the cave floor or else used to cover a hut. Still, it is almost impossible to be sure that prehistoric people used the fur for a ritual context, even if other pieces of evidence such as cave art or portable objects from other regions and period in Europe point to a special link with cave lions, says Herv\u00e9 Bocherens, a paleobiologist at the University of Tubingen in Germany who was not involved in the research. Other purposes cannot be ruled out. As their name implies, cave lions spent part of their lives in caves. Unfortunately, Upper Paleolithic humans also favored those sheltered abodes. Moreover, both species competed for the same prey, including reindeer, and were contenders for the same living spacetensions that have led researchers like Cueto to believe\u00a0that humans likely played a role in the cave lions extinction. With the addition of this new study, Cueto says, evidence is also building that humans directly hunted cave lions. Hunting was not the only cause for cave lion extinction, but it likely played a significant role in addition to other human related activities, she says. Bocherens says more data are needed before we can draw such conclusions. One key piece of information is missing How often were lions hunted by prehistoric humans? he says. What I would be interested to see done in the future is to test if this lion was indeed a member of the local ecosystem, or if the skin could have been obtained from other prehistoric groups living further north, such as France, where cave lions were more common. Cueto plans to continue combing the Spanish cave system for clues that will help solve such remaining mysteries. For starters, cave lions have 18 claws, but she and her team discovered just nine, indicating that there may be more fossils awaiting discovery on the cave floor. Undoubtedly we will continue our research in La Garma, she says. There are still many surprises in this awesome site."}, {"title": "Paleontologists Probe the Bonehead that Foreshadowed Domed Dinos", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "September 22, 2016", "doc": "Pachycephalosaurs are among the most famous of all dinosaurs, set apart from their relatives by\u00a0the thickened domes of bone atop their skulls. But it turns out that these saurians were just copycats. In a study by Virginia Tech paleontologist Michelle Stocker and colleagues released in Current Biology today, there was an even earlier animal that pioneered the bonehead look over a hundred million years before pachycephalosaurs came onto the evolutionary scene.\n\nThe fossil, named Triopticus primus, has a bit of a circuitous history. The bones were uncovered by a Works Progress Administration crew digging in the 230 million year old Otis Chalk of west Texas during the late 1930s and early 1940s. Whoever excavated the fossil didnt know what they had found. The specimen, consisting of a skull roof and braincase, went quietly to rest in the collections of the University of Texas at Austin. It wasnt until 2010 that, while poking through the museum collections, Stocker and her colleagues rediscovered the rock encased specimen and had another look.\n\nWhat they found was a shocker. Even though there wasnt much of the animal, when cleaned of the encasing sediment it had an anatomy unlike any other creature of its time. The skull roof was thick and bulbous, with a large hole in the middle for the parietal eyean opening present in some animals that detects light. Triopticus means three vision for how much the hole resembles an eye socket. One of the most interesting features of Triopticus is the thickened skull roof, just like what we see in the distantly related pachycephalosaur dinosaurs from over 100 million years later, Stocker says. But Triopticus was no dinosaur. Stocker and her colleagues found that this lion sized animal was something more archaic, categorized as an archosauriforman early member of the larger group that includes crocodiles, dinosaurs and their relatives.  \nTriopticus   annotated partial skull\r\n    by WitmerLab at Ohio University\r\n    on Sketchfab\n This was an oddball among oddballs. None of the close relatives that we have for\u00a0Triopticus\u00a0in the Triassic have a similar structure to their heads, Stocker says. Nor is it clear why the animal evolved such a distinctive skull. Its difficult for us to say what this domed morphology would have been for or what would have encouraged the evolution of this structure, she says. While paleontologists debate whether the copycat pachycephalosaurs used their skulls for display, combat or something else, why\u00a0Triopticus\u00a0pioneered this look is a mystery.\n\nNevertheless, the discovery of this dome headed animal highlights a curious pattern in the Age of Reptiles. During the time\u00a0Triopticus, in the Triassic period, dinosaurs had evolved but were small, rare, and did not yet rule the land. Ancient and strange relatives of crocodiles were far more prominent, and they presaged what many dinosaurs would look like millions of years later down the line.\u00a0 There were heavily armored herbivores called aetosaurs that resembled the later ankylosaurs, fierce carnivores called rauisuchids that looked like smaller versions of\u00a0Tyrannosaurus, bipedal croc cousins called shuvosaurids that seem similar to ostrich mimic dinosaurs, and now the more archaic\u00a0Triopticus, setting the thick skulled look long before pachycephalosaurs would do the same. Many of the shapes dinosaurs had evolved by the Cretaceous, crocodile cousins had already tried out millions of years earlier in the Triassic. The Triassic Period may have been a time of experimentation with respect to body plans, Stocker says. Reptiles were bouncing back after the worlds worst mass extinction, with evolution able to generate new forms into a relatively open field of possibilities. The Age of Reptiles may have replayed this on a smaller scale. Many of the dinosaur like croc cousins, as well as\u00a0Triopticus\u00a0and its kin, were largely wiped out by another mass extinction at the end of the Triassic, giving dinosaurs the opportunity to flourish and just happen to evolve along similar lines. Just as fashions get recycled a few decades after the first appear, so evolution can make whats old new again."}, {"title": "Scientists Puzzle Over Unusual Mammoth Skull Unearthed in the Channel Islands", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "September 20, 2016", "doc": "Mammoths are not an unusual find in the Channel Islands National Park, a small archipelago\u00a0just west of Los Angeles. But a well preserved mammoth skull recently excavated from a creek bed on Santa Rosa Island left paleontologists scratching their heads, reports\u00a0Sara Kaplan for\u00a0The Washington Post.  National Park Service biologist Peter Larramendy found the skull in 2014,\u00a0dubbing it\u00a0Larry in his honor, according to a\u00a0press release.\u00a0There are several things that remain a puzzle about the\u00a0find. First,\u00a0Larrys size is a problem. The skull is too large to belong to the diminutive pygmy mammoth, but too small to fit nicely in with the mainland Columbian mammoth, which stood 14 feet tall. The second sticking point is its tusks. The right one is over four feet long and curls like the tusk of an adult mammoth, but the left tusk is short and sloping like a juvenile. The scientists have narrowed possibilities down to three\u00a0either the specimen is an unusually large dwarf mammoth, a teenage Columbian mammoth or a newly discovered intermediary speciesthis last option, according to the researchers, is a long shot. Despite its puzzling origins, the exquisite preservation of the skull makes this an important specimen. This mammoth find is extremely rare and of high scientific importance. It appears to have been on the Channel Islands at the nearly same time as humans, mammoth researcher Justin Wilkins says in the press release. I have seen a lot of mammoth skulls and this is one of the best preserved I have ever seen. The skull also brings into question the timeline of when mammoths arrived on the Channel Islands. Researchers believe that Columbian mammoths swam to the islands, which were\u00a0connected as one\u00a0mass during the ice ages. The isolation on an island, where there are commonly limited resources, often causes miniaturization of species, a process\u00a0called\u00a0insular dwarfism. The presence of this small skull suggests that there were multiple waves of migration to the island, according to\u00a0Dan Muhs, researcher with the U.S. Geological Survey. The first wave likely began during\u00a0the last glacial period about 30,000\u00a0years ago and a second during the preceding glacial period\u00a0roughly 150,000 years ago, he says in the\u00a0press release. This second wave of migration would have meant that the dwarf and regular sized mammoth species could have co existed for some time. Dating of charcoal found near the skull indicates the mammoth died roughly 13,000 years ago, which coincides with the date of Arlington Man,\u00a0one of the earliest human remains found in North America, which was also discovered on Santa Rosa Island. They may be related, according to Muhs. Theres a possibility the mammoths died out before humans arrived, and its possible humans ...\u00a0hunted them to extinction, he tells Paul Vercammen at\u00a0CNN. But theres a third possibility that at the end of the last glacial period, mammoths could have been under stress with limited food resources with sea levels rising at the islands. Then the arrival of humans delivered the final blow. Scientists may soon be able to answer some of the questions about Larry. The specimen has been covered in burlap and plaster for transport\u00a0to the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History where studies of the animals teeth will help researchers determine its\u00a0age and species."}, {"title": "Two Pterosaur Finds Are Helping to Untangle Their Family Tree", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "September 2, 2016", "doc": "Pterosaurs come in\u00a0many different shapes and sizes.

Delicate and light weight, pterosaur skulls are usually crushed before they fossilizeresearchers have only ever found a few intact specimen. They dubbed the species\u00a0Allkaruen\u00a0koi, which means ancient brain in the indigenous Tehuelche language, and made a detailed CT scan. This analysis allowed the researchers to reconstruct features of the 190 million year old animals brain and inner ear, according to a\u00a0press release. From these scans, the researchers hope to figure out how the pterosaurs brain evolved over time and adapted to life on the wing. Allkaruen, from the middle lower Jurassic limit, shows an intermediate state in the brain evolution of pterosaurs and their adaptations to the aerial environment, Diego Pol, who is part of the research team, says in the release. As a result, this research makes an important contribution to the understanding of the evolution of all of pterosaurs.  The second pterosaur recently unveiled is a tiny creature,\u00a0no bigger than a cat with a wingspan of around five feet,\u00a0Eva\u00a0Botkin Kowacki\u00a0reports for\u00a0The Christian Science Monitor. The creatures fused vertebrae and bone structure indicate that the fossils come from mature animals not from juveniles of larger species,\u00a0according to a press release.\u00a0 The creature likely lived during the late Cretaceous period, 70 to 85 million years ago. But while tiny pterosaurs were common in earlier eras, they are absent from the fossil record at this late date. Many believe that\u00a0by this time the giant\u00a0pterosaurs dominated, with one species sporting a 32 foot wingspan. It was also thought that,\u00a0in the late Cretaceous,\u00a0birds\u00a0filled the tiny creatures niche.

The absence\u00a0of\u00a0juvenile pterosaurs in the\u00a0fossil record from the larger species could mean that the remains from these\u00a0tiny winged creatures just didnt survive to the present day.

It is hard to tell exactly. They arent all in one place. Most of them are in the basement and the attic. Stacked in boxes, bags and giant Rubbermaid containers. A few have strayed into the kitchen, which is supposed to be off limits. Bags of the latest arrivals are spread out on the coffee table. More are spread out on the deck behind his house. A tiny rubber triceratops peeks out from under the couch. I didnt go into the bathroom.  Little white brontosauruses from the 1950s with their tails dragging on the ground. A waist high, anatomically correct sauropod with life like wrinkles. A Jurassic Park branded hadrosaurus, still in the original box. Literal six packs of velociraptors. Think of any toy dinosaur from your childhood\u00a0Knol has it.  Some of the dinosaurs also leave his collection. Knol teaches summer classes for Smithsonian Associates on building dinosaur dioramas he supplies the dinos and the kids take those home. Hes got the credentials for the job. Hes a columnist with the popular magazine Prehistoric Times,\u00a0dedicated to dinosaur enthusiasts and he is a member of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.\u00a0His day job is with the U.S. Census Bureau.\u00a0  The massive collection began when Knol was a child in the 1960s. My grandfather gave me a Flintstones playset for Christmas, he says of the popular television series featuring Fred Flintsone and his pet dinosaur. Both the toys and Knols appetite for knowledge have increased ever since.    Today, Knol possesses what he thinks is the worlds largest collection of toy dinosaurs. How large? Probably about five or six thousand, Knol guessed. I knew a couple of collectors who had more but theyre all dead now. I saw their collections show up on eBay. Thats how you know theyve left the world.   My wife accuses me of being a hoarder, says Knol as he sorts through a cardboard box filled with hundreds of figures that his students had jumbled together. Thats ok, I dont mind. Theyre not supposed to be in the kitchen any more. I used to have a diorama in the top of the kitchen but periodically dinosaurs would fall on top of her while she was cooking and she didnt like that.  Knols family may have a little extra patience with his hobby because of the higher purpose associated with it.  Knol says toy dinosaurs educate children about paleontology and other fields of science when they are well made. Usually they arent, which perpetuates a 70 year old feedback loop of misinformation.  Most toy dinosaurs were driven by popular art when they first appeared on the market in the 1950s, Knol says. In the United States, the most influential piece of art at the time was by a man named\u00a0Zallinger who did the Yale Peabody mural. And if you look at it, most of these figures were directly copied from the mural.  Rudolph Zallingers 110 foot long mural\u00a0The Age of Reptiles\u00a0was groundbreaking when it was completed in 1947. It was the first major work of art depicting recreations of what dinosaurs might have looked like when they were alive. A close up of the mural ran on the cover of Life magazine in 1953 and the artwork quickly became the gold standard for what dinosaurs really looked like. Toymakers cribbed designs from Zallingers work, as did editors and illustrators of educational books for adults and children.  The problem was that Zallingers mural was painted at a time when scientists didnt really know very much about dinosaurs or the world that they lived in.   When I was a kid, plate tectonics did not exist as a scientific field, Knol says. The idea that at the end of the Mesozoic, a comet or giant asteroid hit, that was controversial. The idea that dinosaurs are ancestral to birds, nobody had believed that. Birds were supposed to just be some kind of cousin.  In 1947, nobody knew that most theropod dinosaurs these were the ones that mostly walked around on two feet rather than all four probably had feathers. They were thought of as slow moving, monochromatic, tail dragging, cold blooded lizards. Today, scientists generally agree that these ideas were wrong. The imagined\u00a0T. Rex\u00a0of the 1940s resembles the reconstructed\u00a0T. Rex\u00a0of today about as much as a domestic cow resembles a bison. All the same parts are technically present, but the final effect is very different.  Despite decades of new research, more toys continue to be made from the old molds. Educational books for children continue to be illustrated with images based on those toys and past artwork, including Zallingers mural which is still prominently featured at the Yale Peabody Museum. And then the images in the books drive demand for the flawed toys. A few companies are trying to make more accurate models but the market has resisted them.   I was talking to the Safari Company, whove Ive known for years, says Knol. They were very progressive. They put out a brand new\u00a0T. Rex\u00a0that didnt drag its tail or anything. Retailers insisted that they keep the old one because it still sold better. And because what is in all the childrens books? They dont have feathers, they dont have their tails up the air The kids want things that look like the books that their parents are giving them to read.  Knol carefully chooses the toys used for his diorama classes. He specially orders models that represent up to date science the kids will paint them in colors according to their own imagination, though. While playing with models is fun, accurate science is at the heart of the entire program. Kids learn about geology, climatology, ecology, biomechanics and botany along the way.  We visit the United States Botanic Garden every year with the kids. One of the things we teach the kids is the difference between spores and seeds. We teach the differences between gymnospores and flowering plants. One of the big issues with using plants in dinosaur dioramas was that you couldnt use grasses because they didnt exist. Well, it turns out that they did.  The classes are offered as part of a summer camp offered annually by Smithsonian Associates.\u00a0Exposure to good science at Smithsonians camps\u00a0seems to be paying long term dividends, according to Brigitte Blachere, program manager at the organization. Some of these kids have come back as college students and done internships with certain scientists, she says.   Smithsonian has been presenting summer camps for about 45 years now, says Blachere. Randy has been a big part of that at least for the last 15 years.  The Smithsonian Associates\u00a0Summer Camp program offers one and two week programs geared towards specific interests. Other Associates programs include courses focused on gardening, modern art, robots\u00a0and diorama classes focused on famous conflicts such as the Battle of the Somme and the Mexican American War.  The military diorama classes were what brought Knol and his incredible dinosaur collection to Smithsonian in the first place.  My son was taking a class for the military stuff, says Knol, and I was talking to the guy who did the dioramas. I said that I do dioramas, too, but I mostly do dinosaur stuff. He said we desperately want a dinosaur diorama class. . .and that was over ten years ago and Ive been doing it ever since.  Knol lined up six examples of T. Rex figures for comparison. This isnt something you should really teach with, but it still seems to sell pretty well, he says as he holds an upright, featherless, green\u00a0T. Rex\u00a0that looks like something out of the 1933 version of King Kong.\u00a0Several others had a bird like posture but their feet were oversized to help the toy stand up. Only two have feathers and sinewy, hawk like legs. One of these lies twisted and dead on the ground with chunks of flesh torn away to reveal bones and intestines within.  Truly realistic toy dinosaurs are hard to find and often expensive. The two most accurate of the\u00a0T. Rexes, both made by Collecta, retail for around 30. Highly collectable discontinued models, such as\u00a0Knols prized diplodocus, sculpted by Dan LoRusso and\u00a0made in 1994 by Battat for the Boston Museum of Science, can fetch up to 600 on eBay. Quality and scientific accuracy are highly valued by the community of adult collectors, if less so by parents buying toys for their children.  Even the dinosaurs carried by the gift shops at some\u00a0museums are usually suspect. Its all trash, Knol says. They are low end... My favorite was the triceratops that only had one horn.   Science is really important, says Knol. Getting people interested, especially young people interested in science is important. theres almost no branch of science that I cant teach while showing kids stuff with dinosaurs.\u00a0Everything from plate tectonics to why asteroids hit the earth and what the solar system looks like. When were looking for creative ways to teach kids, lets do it through gamification and introduce these things while having fun rather than doing these death by Power Point lectures that turn everyone off.  There is something to be learned even from the inaccurate toy dinosaurs with their dragging tails and reptilian postures, according to Knol.  Science is not just measuring factoids its really the whole process of we had this information and we thought this, and now we have this other piece of information, so now we think these other things. ...theres a lot of science ignorance today.

Miller stumbled across an ancient skull. The snout had been broken off, but the preserved portion left no question that the cranium belonged to a prehistoric dolphin. From Alaska,\u00a0the skull went to the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History, where it hid its secret\u00a0until new research revealed the fossil for what it really was. As Smithsonian paleontologists Alexandra Boersma and Nicholas Pyenson announce today, what Miller had found was a species previously undiscovered by science.\n\nIts a lovely skull, which is probably the first thing I noticed about it, Boersma says. It was immediately clear to her that the dolphin was a relative of a rare species alive today. The South Asian River dolphin,\u00a0which includes\u00a0the Gangus and Indus river dolphins,\u00a0is an endangered species that makes its home in three river systems of Southeast Asia today, but in the deep past the relatives of this rare cetacean lived at sea. These are called platanistoids. The skull Miller found appeared to be a relative of this strange mammal. The discovery\u00a0was all the more exciting, Boersma says, because it could answer questions about how this once cosmopolitan group dating back over 20 million years dwindled down to one freshwater particular.\n\u00a0 The fossils prodigious age also made it stand out. The archival notes with the specimen stated that it was found in Alaska, and that it was very old for a dolphin, Pyenson says, living during a time period called the Oligocene and the details of whale evolution during this span are still murky. This made the skull Miller found one of the oldest dolphins, not to mention that it is the northernmost find of its type to date. And it turned out to be a species and genus\u00a0never before seen by scientists. Dating to 29 to 24 million years old, Boersma and Pyenson named the dolphin\u00a0Arktocara yakataga\u00a0today in the journal\u00a0PeerJ. Yakataga\u00a0is\u00a0the Tlingit name of\u00a0the region where the fossil was found and\u00a0arktocara\u00a0is a Latin word meaning the\u00a0face of the north. The fossil was also digitized above and made available as a 3D model. Despite being a relative of a living river dolphin,\u00a0Arktocara\u00a0lived at sea. Its not always a sure bet that cetaceans die where they live, Pyenson says, but we think its fair to say that\u00a0Arktocara\u00a0was likely a coastal and ocean going species that was about the size of a modern bottlenose dolphin. While the details of what\u00a0Arktocara\u00a0ate and how it lived await future discoveries, Pyenson expects that it was similar to todays Dalls porpoises.\n\u00a0 Given that fossil dolphins related to the platanistoids have been found from Japan to California to Washington,\u00a0its not a shock to find one popping up in the rock of Alaska, says\u00a0College of Charleston paleontologist\u00a0Robert Boessenecker,\u00a0who was not involved in this study. He adds that\u00a0studies have found that these ancient forms might not be related to todays South Asian River Dolphin,\u00a0but might be more archaic branches that fizzled out. Still regarding the Alaska location where the specimen\u00a0was found, Boessenecker notes that\u00a0high latitude fossil records of marine mammals are unfortunately quite limited, perhaps because they havent been extensively searched, and so more field studies should absolutely be directed towards further examining this site.\n\nFor now, though, Boersma notes that theres much still to discover in museum collections. Not all new fossil species are fresh from the field. Some, like\u00a0Arktocara, have been hiding among the shelves for years. All the time, we find new things in the collections that answer old questions, Boersma says. Now, she and Pyenson are on the lookout for more that might fill out that backstory of todays strange South Asian River Dolphin."}, {"title": "Defying Critics, Paleontologist Paul Olsen Looks for Hidden Answers Behind Mass Extinctions", "author": "Michael Casey", "date": "August 4, 2016", "doc": "When scientists first suggested in the early 1980s that volcanic activity had wiped out most dinosaurs 66 million years ago, Paul Olsen wasnt having any of it. He wasnt even convinced there had been a mass extinction. Olsen, a paleontologist and geologist at Columbia University, eventually came to accept the idea of mass extinctions. He also acknowledged that volcanoes played a role in certain extinction events. But even then, he wasnt entirely convinced about the cause of these extinctions. The leading hypothesis holds massive eruptions blasted carbon dioxide\u00a0into Earths atmosphere, cranking\u00a0up global temperatures within a relatively short period of time. Such a sudden change, the theory goes, would have killed off terrestrial species like the huge ancestors of crocodiles and large tropical amphibians and opened the door for dinosaurs to evolve. Olsen, who discovered his first dinosaur footprint in the 1960s as a teenager in New\u00a0Jersey and still uses the states geological formations to inform his work, wondered whether something else may have been at worksuch as sudden cooling events after some of these eruptions, rather than warming. Its an idea thats been around in some form for decades, but the 63 year old Olsen is the first to strongly argue that sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere could have been responsible for the cooling. A sudden chill would explain the selective nature of the extinctions, which affected some groups strongly and others not at all. His willingness to revive an old debate and look at it from a fresh angle has earned Olsen a reputation as an important voice in the field of earth sciences. From the moment Olsen abandoned dreams of becoming a marine biologist as a scrawny teenager and fell in love with dinosaurs, he courted controversy and earned a reputation for making breathtaking discoveries. Olsens first breakthrough came as a young teen,\u00a0when he, his friend Tony Lessa and several other dinosaur enthusiasts discovered thousands of fossilized footprints at a quarry near his house in Rosemount, New Jersey. They were the remnants of carnivorous dinosaurs and tiny crocodile relatives that dated back to the Jurassic, 201 million years ago. The teens efforts to successfully designate the quarry as a dinosaur park inspired a 1970 Life magazine article.\u00a0 Olsen even sent a letter to President Richard Nixon urging his support for the park, and followed that with a cast of a dinosaur footprint.\u00a0It is a miracle that nature has given us this gift, this relic of the ages, so near to our culturally starved metropolitan area, the young Olsen wrote in a later letter to Nixon. A great find like this cannot go unprotected and it must be preserved for all humanity to see. Olsen eventually received a response from the\u00a0deputy director of the Interior Departments Mesozoic Fossil Sites Division. Olsen shook things up again as an undergraduate student at Yale. In this case, he and Peter Galton published\u00a0a 1977 paper in Science that questioned whether the end Triassic mass extinction had even happened, based on what he called incorrect dating of the fossils. Subsequent fossil discoveries showed that Olsen was wrong, which he readily acknowledged. In the 1980s, Olsen demonstrated that Earths orbital cyclesthe orientation of our planet on its axis and the shape of its path around the suninfluenced tropical climates and caused lakes to come and go as far back as 200 million years ago. It was a controversial idea at the time, and even today has its doubters. More recently, Olsen and colleagues dated the Central Atlantic Magmatic Provincelarge igneous rock deposits that were the result of massive volcanic eruptionsto 201 million years ago. That meant the eruptions played a role in the end Triassic mass extinction. They published their results in a 2013 study in the journal Science. But it is his latest projectreexamining the causes of mass extinctionsthat could be his most controversial yet. Researchers generally recognize five mass extinction events over the past 500 million years, Olsen explains. We may be in the middle of a sixth event right now, which started tens of thousands of years ago with the extinction of animals like the mastodon. Determining the causes and timing of these extinctions is incredibly difficult. Regardless of cause, however, these events\u00a0can pave the way for whole new groups of organisms. In fact, the disappearance of nearly all synapsidsa group that includes mammals and their relativesin the Triassic may have allowed for the evolution of dinosaurs about 230 million years ago. The accepted theory for the end Triassic extinction states that gases from enormous volcanic eruptions led to a spike in carbon dioxide levels, which in turn increased global temperatures by as much as 11 degrees F. Terrestrial species, like the huge ancestors of crocodiles and large tropical amphibians, would have perished because they couldnt adapt to the new climate. However, this explanation never sat well with Olsen. If we are back in the time of the Triassic and the dominant life forms on land are these crocodile relatives, why would a three degree Celsius increase in temperature do anything? asks Olsen, sitting in\u00a0his\u00a0office on the campus of Columbia Universitys\u00a0Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory\u00a0in Palisades, New York.\u00a0 Some inland tropical areas would have become lethally hot, Olsen says, surrounded by\u00a0fossils, dinosaur memorabilia and a Nixon commendation on the wall. But the mountains and coastlines would still be bearable. Its hard to imagine the temperature increase would be a big deal, he says. Three years ago, Olsen began looking at the fossil record of species that survived other mass extinctions, like the Cretaceous Tertiary K T event 66 million years ago and the Permian event roughly 250 million years ago. What he saw suggested a completely different story\u00a0Earths climate during and after these volcanic eruptions or asteroid impacts got briefly but intensely cold, not hotter, as volcanic ash and droplets of sulfate aerosols obscured the sun. Scientists generally agree that the reduced sunlight would have disrupted photosynthesis, which plants need to survive. During the K T extinction event, plant losses would have left many herbivorous dinosaurs, and their predators, with little to eat. In this case, size became the determining factor in whether a species went extinct. Large animals need more food than smaller animals to survive, Olsen explains.\u00a0 With his fluffy white mustache and hearty laugh, Olsen is hard to miss at paleontology meetings. Hes not afraid to insert himself into mass extinction debates, but is quick to point out that he counts even his most ardent critics among his friends. Supporters praise his creativity, persistence and willingness to consider the big unanswered questions in paleontology that, if solved, would alter our understanding of important events like mass extinctions. Among academics, you see two types. You see the parachutists and you see the truffle hunters, and Paul is a parachutist, says Hans Sues, chairman of the department of paleobiology at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. The parachutist is the one who helps build the big frame in which other people operate.\u00a0Sues and Olsen, who have pieced together fossils in the past, have known each other for 30 years.  Olsens latest projectthe volcanic winter theoryhas him looking for ancient ash deposits from the United States to Morocco to the United Kingdom. He hopes to find the fingerprints of certain sulfur isotopes and metals that could indicate that sulfur rich super eruptions occured. They would also pinpoint the timing of the eruptions relative to the extinctions, Olsen explains. Evidence of ancient ice would also bolster his case. For those clues, Olsen must look to mud flats laid down in what would have been the tropicssome of which are in areas in New Jersey, where he searched for dinosaurs as a teenager. If you find these little crystals on mud flats, you know it froze in the tropics, Olsen says. Sues is among those who believe Olsens hypothesis has merit, partly because Olsen is focused on the sulfate aerosols from eruptions. In the recent past, massive volcanic eruptionslike Mount Pinatubo in 1991belched the sulfate aerosols into the atmosphere, which reduced global temperatures. The trick is finding evidence of extreme cold in rocks, Sues says. But other scientists, like Spencer G. Lucas, curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, have their doubts. As someone who has long sparred with Olsen on mass extinctions, Lucas agrees that volcanism played a role in extinctions and isnt ruling out cooling as the cause. But finding chemical evidence of that in the rocks or preserved ash will be difficult, if not impossible, to find, he says. Searching for those clues isnt a waste of time though, says Lucas. He wants someone who cares about the problem, like Olsen, to collect the evidence and makes a convincing case for the Earth either cooling or warming during these extinctions. Paul is sort of the Don Quixote of extinctions, Lucas says. He is tilting at a windmill in my mind. But Im glad hes doing it because he knows he has got the background, the smarts and the opportunity. If anybody can figure this out, he will."}, {"title": "Chew on This: Powerful Jaws Fueled a Jurassic Herbivore Boom ", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "July 21, 2016", "doc": "Remember Ducky from The Land Before Time? The adorable little dinosaur was one of the duckbillsknown to paleontologists as hadrosaursthat roamed far and wide during the Cretaceous chapter of the great dinosaur story. Duckbill bones are so numerous in some places that these herbivorous dinos are sometimes called the cows of the Cretaceous. But what allowed these plentiful, shovel mouthed dinosaurs to become so successful? For a time, the success of the duckbills thought to be powered by the rise of a new kind of green food flowering plants. The timing seemed to be right. The earliest definitive flowering plants, or angiosperms, date to about 125 million years ago. Before that, the ancestors and relatives of hadrosaursa broader group called ornithopodswere not particularly numerous in terms of species or populations. By about 100 million years ago, however, hadrosaur evolution had exploded, spilling dozens of new species across North America and Eurasia. Perhaps these dinosaurs were taking advantage of a new food source, evolving in tandem with ancient angiosperms that had begun to spread across the northern hemisphere. At one point, a number of researchers related the rapid diversification of hadrosaurs and ceratopsians to the initial evolutionary radiation of angiosperms with many weedy forms such as the spindly Archaefructus, says Hans Dieter Sues, a paleontologist at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. This idea eventually fell out of favor, however. In a new study in the journal Scientific Reports, University of Bristol paleontologist Edward Strickson and colleagues further bury the hypothesis, arguing that the evolutionary bursts that led hadrosaurs to become so ubiquitous had nothing to do with flowers. Instead, these big mouths owe their success to their remarkable jaws and teeth, which allowed them to take advantage of a greater array of plant foods.  When they mapped out the differences in ornithopod jaw anatomy, as well as the dinosaurs family tree, Strickson and his coauthors didnt find a close association between the Mesozoic vegetarians and flowering plants. The first big burst in ornithopod evolution was in the Jurassic, tens of millions of years before angiosperms even came on the scene, later followed by three tightly grouped bumps in diversity around 90 million years ago. And regarding their chompers, the researchers found that hadrosaurs generally had very similar jaws across species. Whatever they hit on early, it worked for them. In other words, there was no sign that the teeth and jaws of hadrosaurs specifically evolved to crunch up flowering plants.\n\nThe key to the Day of the Duckbill, then, seems to be their specialized jaws. Most dinosaurs couldnt chew. Their jaws were little different than biological sets of scissors or shears, which worked just fine when it came to swallowing things whole. But the ancestors of hadrosaurs evolved densely packed rows of leaf shaped teeth, not to mention jaw bones that could flex and swing to create a unique kind of chewing motion. This gave hadrosaurs the ability to grind their food, a major feat thatas fossilized poop and other lines of evidence have shownallowed them to chew through conifers and other tough vegetation. Maybe instead of big mouth, Ducky should have been nicknamed great mouth.  But dont discount flower power just yet. Looking at the rise of the hadrosaurs and the horned ceratopsians, Sues says that there must have been some floral change or changes during the mid Cretaceous to account for the sudden appearance of two very diverse groups of large bodied, herd forming dinosaurian herbivores. And in the Southern Hemisphere, where these dinosaurs were largely absent, giant, long necked herbivores called titanosaurs proliferated to fill that niche around the same time. I still have a lingering suspicion that all these evolutionary radiations are at least in some way connected to the diversification of angiosperms, Sues says. \u00a0Its a hunch paleontologists will likely be chewing over for a long while."}, {"title": "Arm Day at the Gym Apparently Not a Thing for Newly Found, Tiny-Armed Dino ", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "July 13, 2016", "doc": "In paleontology, youre always most likely to find something on the very last day of the season. Thats what happened in 2007, when a multi institution team of paleontologists was poking around Patagonias Huincul Formation looking for one last find. Its the last day, youd better find something good Field Museum paleontologist Pete Makovicky joked to the team. Then\u00a0Akiko Shinya,\u00a0his lab preparator, did just that. A few moments after Makovickys command, Shinya found the first signs of an unusual dinosaur with an unexpected connection to the celebrated Tyrannosaurus rex.  The new dinosaur, described today\u00a0by Makovicky and coauthors in the journal PLOS ONE, only survived in pieces part of the spine, belly ribs, tail, hips, hind limbs, and arms were recovered. However, taken together, these parts represent a species of dinosaur not seen before in the approximately 94 million year old boneyard of northern Patagonia. The researchers have named it Gualicho shinyae, with the species name honoring Shinya for her 11th hour discovery. Gualicho refers to a Spanish name for a local goddess later reinterpreted as a wellspring of bad luck. The name was chosen to reflect the difficult circumstances surrounding the discovery and study of the specimen, the paleontologists write, and its contentious history following excavation. Gualichos most striking feature is one some might see as its most pathetic Like T. rex, the arms of Gualicho are short and spindly, with only two prominent fingers. The remnant of the third finger is reduced to a tiny splint. This wouldnt be surprising in a tyrannosaur, but Gualicho is no T. rex the dinosaur belonged to a group that included Allosaurus and its kinpredators that usually have been found with longer arms and three functional fingers. No one had found an allosaur with arms like this before, making the find a puzzling one for paleontologists. The reduction of the hand and number of digits is particularly striking, says University of Southern California paleontologist Michael Habib, who was not involved in the research. So apparently arm day at the gym was not a thing for Gualicho, just as it wasnt for Tyrannosaurus, the stubby armed Carnotaurus, and other predatory dinosaurs that independently evolved abbreviated forelimbs. The question facing paleontologists is why so small? Smaller arms and hands in dinosaurs like Gualicho, Tyrannosaurus, Carnotaurus, and others, says University of Maryland paleontologist Thomas Holtz, Jr., is almost certainly due to the shared reduction in function in said limbs. Thinking in terms of how these dinosaurs hunted, Holtz says that this almost certainly marks a shift to head only prey acquisition and dispatch. That is, long arms with meathook claws may not have been much benefit to Gualicho and other carnivores. The forelimbs of most theropods likely had only limited function, Habib says, meaning that smaller forelimbs, while silly looking, might not have been a disadvantage. Quite the opposite Reducing the arms was probably beneficial in that they got them out of the way of the more powerful jaws, says Holtz, who was also not involved in the research. More than that, Habib points out that The most obvious advantage to having short arms for a terrestrial carnivorous dinosaur is the associated increase in available space for neck muscles to anchor to the torso. In other words smaller arms, better bite."}, {"title": "These Paleo Pets Made Fossil Hunting Less Lonely", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "July 11, 2016", "doc": "Picture a paleontologist on the hunt for the next big fossil find. More likely than not, its an intrepid, lone explorer staving off heat exhaustion as they search the ground. Yet, since the dawn of their discipline, paleontologists have been bringing their furry companions out into the rocky outcrops where prehistoric wonders rest. Animal assistants have been accompanying fossil hunters for nearly 200 years.\n\nThe most famous rockhound of all was one of the first. Tray, a mutt of a terrier sort, was the loyal friend of early 19th century paleontologist Mary Anning. Fossil lore says that Anning was the inspiration for the rhyme She sells seashells by the seashore but, regardless of whether thats true or not, Anning made a reputation for herself as a skilled field expert with a sharp eye for strange marine reptiles eroding out of the Jurassic stone on Englands southern coast.\n\nTray followed Anning on her shoreline expeditions, and even helped out as a field assistant. When Anning would temporarily leave a find to go get help digging it out, Tray would stay behind, marking the place where the fossil rested. But the cliffs of Englands Jurassic Coast are treacherous. Piles of rock frequently calve off the rock walls to crash onto the beach below, and that is how, one day in 1833, Tray met his early demise. Anning continued her work for over a decade more, but there was no replacing Tray. Anning wasnt the only paleontologist to work with canine colleagues. Mary Leakey, another paleontology pioneer, also loved her dogs. Dalmatians were her favorite, and her pups often accompanied her into the field. In fact, Leakeys dalmatians were trotting along with her on July 17, 1959, when she stumbled upon the skull of an early human that would go by various names such as Zinj, Dear Boy and Nutcracker Man before getting the permanent title Paranthropus boisei. There was a practical reason for the dogs to be along for the scientifically significant stroll. Eastern Africa has a greater array of potentially dangerous wildlifethink lions and venomous snakesthan other boneyards, so the dogs were an early warning system as well as beloved family members. In the decades since Tray padded along the Charmouth beaches and Leakeys dalmations romped through Olduvai, other paleo pets have accompanied their humans into the field. Dogs, eager to maintain their reputation as a paleontologists best friend, often follow their human friends to remote places. My German shepherd Jet recently accompanied me out to the 48 million year old rock of Wyoming, keeping me company and boosting camp morale as the field crew searched for mammals from before dogs even came on the evolutionary scene. From excavations of massive blocks of dinosaur fossils to explorations of Ice Age caves, Ive met Laika, Pickles and plenty of other helpful canines. Sometimes paleontologists meet new companions out in the field. We had a feral dog become part of our camp in Mongolia, keeping the other feral dogs at bay, says Western University of Health Sciences paleontologist Brian Kraatz. The dog was so attached to the field crew that she followed them to the next field camp, over 18 miles away. Meredith Rivin of the Burke Museum had a similar experience with a pitbull on a mitigation project in California. At first, the dog made Rivin and the construction crew nervous. She had a lot of scars, cropped ears, and was just generally mean looking, Riven says. I shared a bit of my sandwich with the dog, and she instantly became a wiggly mess and my best friend for the rest of the project. \u00a0\n\nEven wild animals can give paleontologists a hand, intentionally or not. Porcupines, leopards, and owls, for example, have often stashed bones in caves, preserving them for paleontologists to find. More directly, animals have helped researchers spots fossils on the groundlike a chicken that reportedly tipped off paleontologists to a large mammoth fossil in Nebraska by pecking at bones peeking out of the ground. And who could forget Billy the hyena? He was the pet and study subject of 19th century geologist William Buckland, who used the tooth marks the young spotted hyena left on ox bones to help make the case that Englands Kirkdale Cave had once been the den of Billys Ice Age relatives. Taking a page from Bucklands book, Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument paleontologist Kari Prassack that shes had some camp dogs help her out with studying how carnivores modify bones, too.\n\nThen theres Bob. While cats typically shy away from running around in the harsh desert sun, there is one feline that continues to earn her keep at the La Brea asphalt seeps in Los Angeles, California. Bobnamed after the tailless bobcat, because she has had her tail surgically removed for health reasonsrests and stalks and nuzzles the paleontologists excavating immense tree boxes full of Ice Age fossils near the museum, earning her keep by controlling the local rodent population. While she hasnt made any major finds herself yet, this modern cousin of Smilodon is a reminder that cats still rule La Brea."}, {"title": "The Event that Wiped out Dinosaurs Also Nearly Did in the Mammals", "author": "Marissa Fessenden", "date": "June 22, 2016", "doc": "About 65 million years ago the Cretaceous era came to a dramatic end when a huge asteroid slammed into the Earth and likely jump started the mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs. In the wake of such devastation, plucky mammals in their underground burrows survived and eventually rose to the prominence they enjoy today.\u00a0  At least, thats the narrative scientists constructed after decades of research. But a\u00a0new study, published in the\u00a0Journal of Evolutionary Biology,\u00a0shows\u00a0that the passing of the crown from non avian dinosaurs to mammals wasnt a sure thing. Mammals\u00a0narrowly escaped their own wholesale extinction by the skin of their teeth.  The extinction was a lot more severe than we previously thought and the recovery was more rapid,\u00a0Nick Longrich, paleontologist at the University of Bath and\u00a0a co author of the new research, tells Smithsonian.com.  During his years of studying fossils, Longrich\u00a0noticed that specimen after specimen was yet another long extinct species that once crawled, skittered or scuttled across the surface of Ancient Earth. In short, there were a lot more dead ends on the tree of life than he expected. So Longrich and his colleagues set out to quantify how the mammals fared during the end Cretaceous extinction. They looked at the fossil record from a few million years just before and after the asteroid impact and counted as many species as they could. Most fossils from that time periodso all the fossils they studiedhail from North America\u00a0because the ancient conditions there were just right to preserve dead creatures, and\u00a0much of that\u00a0rock now conveniently\u00a0sits near the surface.  The study documents\u00a0over 8,000 specimens from 23 locations across 145 species. From that lot, the researchers only found 7 percent that survived the extinction.\u00a0The picture is more dire than we thought, Longrich says. The researchers also note\u00a0that the victims of the mass extinction were species that occupied small\u00a0ranges. Common, widespread species were more likely to survive. Previous estimates have determined that about 75 percent of mammal species were killed off in the end Cretaceous extinction, leaving nearly a quarter to populate the newly dinosaur less world. That interpretation, however, falls apart under closer inspection of the fossil record. Extinction wipes out rare things and the common things tend to survive, explains Longrich. That means that the fossil record is peppered with specimens of species that survived and only lightly seasoned with a few members of rarer species that may have succumbed to extinction.\u00a0To account for all these rare, sparely distributed species, scientists must examine a massive number of samples.\u00a0A more cursory look at the fossil record could result in an overestimate of mammal\u00a0survival.  Though the situation may seem direthe glass is 93 percent empty, says Longrichthe new findings also show that mammals were very resilient. Within 300,000 years\u00a0after the mass extinction, just a\u00a0blink of an eye\u00a0in evolutionary time, mammal diversity\u00a0around the world exploded.  The mammals quickly started specializing, getting large and doing interesting things, Longrich says. The rapid recovery after extinction included\u00a0an explosion in species diversity that rivals\u00a0the rapidly diversifying of Galapagos finches or cichild fish in African lakestwo common examples of fast splintering\u00a0species.  The results of the study also suggest that mammals were somehow uniquely posed for success, Longrich explains. This astounding recovery occurred in all the continents of the world despite the fact that water separated these landmasses at the time.\u00a0In essence, each continent was a separate experiment and all came up with the same results mammal domination. Lizards, turtles and crocodiles didnt make such a quick recovery.\u00a0 So why did mammals thrive? It might have been the warm blood, intelligence or maybe because they had more complex teeth, Longrich says. More study is needed to say precisely\u00a0what\u00a0gave them the advantageit could have been a number of things.  Even so, these most recent results suggest that\u00a0other mass extinction events\u00a0may deserve a closer look. Just as the history books are written by the victors, the fossil record is dominated by survivors. But in both fields, recognizing the\u00a0bias helps\u00a0provide a clearer picture of the history of life on Earth."}, {"title": "In This Jurassic Boneyard, It\u2019s Not Size That Counts", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "June 2, 2016", "doc": "On the edge of Fruita, Colorado, scattered through a half square mile of red and gray rock, is one of the richest Jurassic boneyards anywhere. Over the years paleontologists have excavated the remains of a beautifully preserved Ceratosaurus, the bones of at least six Allosaurus strewn together in death, and other Jurassic classics from this pocket of geological riches. But the most magnificent fossils to come out of the Fruita Paleo Area arent giants like Apatosaurus and Stegosaurus. What makes this 150 million year old spot so special is that it contains an exquisite record of Jurassic life at a much smaller scale.\n\nEven though paleontologists and amateur naturalists knew about fossils in the hills around Fruita since the 1890s, it wasnt until 1975 that the wonders of what would become the Fruita Paleo Area started to become known. In that year, California State University paleontologist George Callison brought his students to exposures of the Morrison Formation, the rock layer where most Jurassic era fossils in North America are found, in the deserts of western Colorado. Their mission To look for the animals that scurried and slithered beneath the feet of Brachiosaurus and other Jurassic titans. While stopping to tie his boots, so the story goes, then graduate student Jim Clark noticed black flecks in a piece of sandstone that turned out to be the bones of a three foot long crocodile that looks like a reptilian version of a small greyhound.\n\nClarks crocodile was named Fruitachampsa in 2011. Exactly how this small saurian made its living is unclear, but its bones have turned up at another rarity in the Fruita Paleo Area  the nesting site of a small, herbivorous dinosaur called Dryosaurus, with preserved eggshell as well as the bones of young dinosaurs. The evidence is only circumstantial, simply placing Fruitachampsa at the scene, but the discovery of the odd crocs bones among the hatchlings might hint that this blunt snouted carnivore had a taste for eggs and unwary infants.\n\nFruitachampsa wasnt the only small animal to turn up in Fruita. In 1987 Callison wrote that his teams scratchings at the Fruita Paleo Area rock had yielded some vertebrae that looked very much like they belonged to a snake. Other experts thought a lizard identification fit better, but, just last year, Callisons hunch turned out to be right  the tiny bones had once formed the spine of Diablophis, an early snake that would have still had limbs as it slithered through the forests and floodplains of the Jurassic world. Other discoveries in the area include Fruitadens  a dinosaur with tusk like teeth and one of the smallest ever found  named in 2010, and the ant eating mammal Fruitafossor announced by paleontologists in 2005. Such fossils come from pockets of delicate preservation called microsites, and theyre quite rare in the Jurassic Morrison Formation, says Museums of Western Colorado paleontologist Julia McHugh. She and her crew continue to sift through the sites that Callison and his students identified back in the 70s, and this is because of the unprecedented view that small animals can provide of the habitat back when\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0stalked this land. Small animals give you a more detailed picture of an ecosystem, McHugh says, particularly because they tend to have larger populations and are more sensitive to environmental changes. The small crocodiles, mammals, snakes, lizards, and other animals of the Fruita Paleo Area are more likely to provide insights about what the world was like at the time than the comparatively enormous dinosaurs that fill museum halls. And its not just animals. Just last year, McHugh says, a Jurassic pine cone was found in the Fruita Paleo Area that may allow experts to identify at least one of the conifer species that grew there.\n\nAfter decades of excavation, the FPA is still generating new discoveries of evolution, McHugh says. There are likely still transformative tales to be drawn from the rocks on the outskirts of town. Other Morrison microsites further north have produced amphibian fossils, McHugh says, but these delicate ecological indicators have yet to be found in Fruita. With luck, theyll soon peek out of this exceptional Jurassic graveyard."}, {"title": "Two New Discoveries Add to a Horned Dino Revolution", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "May 20, 2016", "doc": "Everyone knows Triceratops. Old three horned face has stood as the ultimate in spiky dinosaurs since it was named in 1889. Yet Triceratops was only the last in a long line of horned dinosaurs. Horned dinosaurs thrived on prehistoric Asia and North America for over 100 million years, and its only now that paleontologists are uncovering a wealth of ceratopsians that are weirder and more varied than anyone ever expected. When paleontologist Peter Dodson published his then comprehensive book The Horned Dinosaurs in 1996, experts recognized about 23 different horned dinosaurs. Now the count has more than tripled, ranging from lanky little creatures known only from bits of jaw like Gryphoceratops to hulking, spiky herbivores such as Kosmoceratops hailed as the horniest dinosaur ever when discovered. The rate of discovery is blistering, and, in fact, just this week paleontologists announced two new horned dinosaurs simultaneously. One of the new dinosaurs, discovered in the 77 million year old rock of southern Utah, is a variation of something familiar. Named by Ohio University paleontologist Eric Lund and colleagues, Macharioceratops cronusi  meaning bent sword face    looks like a close cousin of the sinister looking Diabloceratops found in older strata of the same region. About four million years separate the two, and Machairoceratops can immediately be told apart by two forward pointing spikes jutting from the back of its frill. The other new ceratopsid on the block is Spiclypeus shipporum. This dinosaur lived around 76 million years ago in what is now northern Montana, Canadian Museum of Nature paleontologist Jordan Mallon and coauthors report, and its boldly audacious look comes from brow horns jutting out to the side and an unusual arrangement of frill spikes with some pointing outward and others folded down. That array gave the dinosaur its genus name, meaning spiked shield. In fact, Mallon says, this curious combination of ornament styles might explain how some other dinosaurs got their distinctive headgear. Spiclypeus was a close relative of Kosmoceratops from Utah and Vagaceratops from Alberta, both of which had frill spikes that jutted downwards instead of out. I suspect what were seeing is an interesting transitional morphology in Spiclypeus between the more primitive forms where the spikes all radiate outward and the more advanced forms, like Kosmoceratops and Vagaceratops, where they curl forward, Mallon says. Together Macharioceratops and Spiclypeus give a big boost to the count of known horned dinosaurs and give diehard dino fans a pair of new names to master. There are now so many of these pointy plant eaters, Mallon says, that Its getting hard to keep up But given that the dinosaurs have been waiting in the ground for over 66 million years, why are we experiencing such a great Dinosaur Rush now? The answer, much like the frill of\u00a0Machaerioceratops, is two pronged. The first, Raymond M. Alf Museum paleontologist Andrew Farke says, is that there are simply more people and more museums searching for dinosaurs than ever before. Whenever you have more people out on the ground looking, youre going to find more stuff, Farke says. That goes for museum collections, too. In 2011 Farke and colleagues announced they had found a previously unknown horned dinosaur tucked away in the collections of Londons Natural History Museum. They named this long lost dinosaur\u00a0Spinops sternbergorum. But its not just a numbers game. There are still great patches of western North America that have been little explored. The rocks that\u00a0Macharioceratops\u00a0was found in are a good example, Farke says, as the deserts of southern Utah were thought to be either too remote or lacking in fossils until recently. With persistence, these isolated places are yielding unexpected dinosaurs. Now crews are taking another look at spots that have been previously overlooked with an eye to filling in more parts of the horned dinosaur story. For example, Farke says, paleontologists dont yet know what was going on with North Americas ceratopsids between 90 and 80 million years ago, the time period when these dinosaurs started to get big and evolve into a spiky variety of new forms. The fossils are probably out there, Farke says, waiting to be found. And, Mallon says, theres much to be learned from what experts have already collected. Theres probably some interesting variation in already collected fossils that people just havent been looking for, Mallon says, and these clues can help paleontologists get a better idea of how these magnificent animals evolved. The discovery of a new dinosaur or two isnt just another addition to the ever growing list of dinosaur names. The power in these things is that when we have large numbers of specimens and large numbers of species, you can start asking and answering big picture evolutionary questions, Farke says. Horned dinosaurs were around for 100 million years, and so, Farke says, filling gaps in time and space with new species can allow paleontologists to look into whether these dinosaurs co evolved with flowering plants, competed with other herbivores of their time, and how they might have been affected by shifting climates.\u00a0Macharioceratops,\u00a0Spiclypeus, and all the rest were undoubtedly awesome, but they have so many stories left to tell."}, {"title": "Newly Discovered Dinosaur Species Had Great Eyesight and a Droopy Head", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "April 27, 2016", "doc": "Back in 1997, Argentine paleontologist Rub\u00e9n D. F. Mart\u00ednez of the National University of Patagonia found a well preserved dinosaur skull near the town of Sarmiento. But it wasnt until recently that Mart\u00ednez realized hed discovered a new species of titanosaur, the largest animals to have ever roamed the planet. Using CT scans, Mart\u00ednez along with Lawrence M. Witmer, a professor of paleontology at Ohio University and Matt Lamanna, assistant curator at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, determined that the skull and associated neck bones came from an undescribed species of dinosaur, which they named Sarmientosaurus musacchioi and detail in an article published in the journal PLOS One. The scans revealed that Sarmientosaurus is quite different than other titanosaurs, most of which lived 100 to 95 million years ago\u00a0during the mid Cretaceous period,\u00a0including 70 ton giants like Puertasaurus and Argentinosaurus. Sarmientosaurus is a little smaller, roughly 40 feet long and weighing only 10 tons. According to Kenneth Chang at The New York Times, the dino had a broad snout and fatter teeth. Large eye sockets suggest that its vision was more advanced than later titanosaurs. Also, its inner ear\u00a0was tuned to low frequency sounds. Maybe to track predatorsor the movements of its own herd, Witmer tells Chang. The position of the inner ear also suggests that Sarmientosaurus kept its head drooped at a 45 degree angle as it foraged on plants. The scans also suggest the large creatures brain likely was only\u00a0about the size of a lime. Its pretty small, Witmer tells Chang. You try not to judge him, but its a pretty small brain.  The skull is special for another reason according to a\u00a0press release, despite having identified over 60 species of\u00a0titanosaur, researchers only have complete or semi complete skulls for four of them.\u00a0Sarmientosaurus\u00a0has probably the most complete and best preserved skull of any\u00a0sauropod\u00a0from South America to date, paleontologist Mathew\u00a0Wedel\u00a0of Western University of Health Sciences in California tells\u00a0Brian\u00a0Switek\u00a0at\u00a0National Geographic. Wedel\u00a0is also a fan of the specimen because it fills in an evolutionary gap in the\u00a0titanosaurus\u00a0tree between older species like\u00a0Brachiosaurus\u00a0and later relatives. To me,\u00a0Sarmientosaurus\u00a0is cool because it bridges that gap,\u00a0Wedel\u00a0tells\u00a0Switek. You can take one look at this thing and say, Yeah, cool, weve been waiting for someone like you. Because of the lack of skulls, the mass of detail from the scans is a step forward for paleontologists. This group, to me, theyre quite mysterious,\u00a0Lamanna\u00a0tells Chang. By combining data from these different discoveries, were gradually building up a picture as to what the biology of these animals was like. In other words, what makes the largest land animals of all time tick? For\u00a0Mart\u00ednez, the 20 year wait to add his find to the dinosaur family tree has been worth it. Discoveries like\u00a0Sarmientosaurus\u00a0happen once in a lifetime, he says in the press release.

Genetic research suggests that this was the moment that monkeys crossed into regions of present day Central America from their ancestral homes to the south. But seven teeth found in Panama suggest that the primates headed north much earlier, and that they crossed 100 miles of ocean to reach their new world. According to a paper published this week in\u00a0Nature, seven monkey teeth were discovered encased in 21 million year old rock found during an excavation of material from the Panama Canal expansion. That means the primates must have crossed an ocean barrier once thought insurmountable for most animals. Its fantastic, Marcelo Tejedor, who studies primates at Argentinas National Patagonian Center in Chubut and who wasnt involved in the study tells Lizzie Wade at Science. This opens up a heap of possibilities we never expected. Its unlikely that the little primates swam to Panama, so its believed they must have floated over, perhaps on a mat of vegetation. When there are events like hurricanes or major earthquakes or tsunamis, vegetation and clumps of dirt can get washed off the shore. Animals can come along with it, Siobh\u00e1n Cooke, a paleobiologist at Northeastern Illinois University who was not part of this study tells Eva Botwin Kowacki at The Christian Science Monitor. Monkeys are pretty good dispersers. It isnt surprising that they were able to disperse to North America. The history of monkey dispersal is filled with mysteries. The fossil record shows that monkeys evolved in Africa. Between 34 and 37 million years ago, they somehow found a way to South America. Many believe they crossed the Atlantic on similar mats of vegetation, Wade points out, but that is not certain. It was thought monkeys came to Central America during an event dubbed the Great American Biotic Interchange, which took place after the Isthmus of Panama connected the two continents, allowing relatives of opossums, armadillos and porcupines to head north and deer, cats, raccoons, bears, and other species to cross the isthmus to the southern continent. This new discovery means researchers need to second guess those assumptions. The seven monkey teeth found in Panama suggest the ancient species, dubbed Panamacebus transitus, was related to present day capuchin and squirrel monkeys. Its not known how large the population of monkeys was in Panama, and digs all around Central America have never produced any evidence that the ancient monkeys made it further north. Jonathan Bloch, the curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Florida Museum of Natural History and lead author of the study says thats one of the biggest questions the research raises. This monkey species can disperse everywhere, but it just cant go north on this continent. Whats the problem? he tells Wade. In Panama, he suggests, the monkeys found vegetation and fruits similar to what they ate in South America. Once they headed north to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, however, they probably didnt know how to handle the changing ecosystem."}, {"title": "Paleontologists Unveil Dinosaur Stomping Ground in Utah", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "April 15, 2016", "doc": "Hundreds of millions of years ago, long before the town of Moab existed, dinosaurs roamed eastern Utah. Tracks tell their tales. Prehistoric footprints by the hundreds are preserved in the stone surrounding this former uranium boom town, a silent record of the three major chapters, or periods, of the Age of Dinosaurs. Some of these footprints are hidden away in the backcountry, known only to experts. But others nearly run through the city, exposed along the roads leading to and through the desert community. It was in one of these more accessible places, along U.S. Route 191, that a chance discovery recently led paleontologists to one of the most spectacular dinosaur stomping grounds ever found in the state.\n\nOfficially named the Mill Canyon Dinosaur Tracks in a public unveiling earlier this month, the fossil bonanza was hiding in plain sight. The 112 million year old trackways sit beneath powerlines that run toward Moab and are a short troll from a parking lot that regularly serves as a temporary home for RV campers. But the tracks remained unnoticed until 2009, says Bureau of Land Management paleontologist ReBecca Hunt Foster, when a local Moabite, driving along an old jeep track that ran over the spot, noticed a few exposed tracks. That first find was only a sampling. As paleontologists quickly exposed and examined the site, they found prehistoric traces left by an entire array of Cretaceous animals. Pothole shaped depressions made by a long necked dinosaur similar to\u00a0Camarasaurus\u00a0cross over and muddle the three toed imprints previously left by a large carnivorous dinosaur. Nearby are what seem to be the pockmarks of the plodding steps of an armored dinosaur, while just a stones throw away are the distinctive two toed tracks of a large raptor. There are at least six types of dinosaur tracks here, Hunt Foster says, in addition to other traces, such as a furrow left by a crocodile sliding into water.\n\nAll these footprints, scrapes and other traces are from a slice of time that is still mysterious. The Mill Canyon tracks are preserved in rocks known as the\u00a0Cedar Mountain Formation, layers laid down after Jurassic classics such as\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0and\u00a0Stegosaurus\u00a0lived, but long before the reign of\u00a0Tyrannosaurus\u00a0and\u00a0Triceratops. The tracks site is located in the Ruby Ranch Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation, Hunt Foster says, and this is significant because fewer skeletal fossils have been found in this part of the formation than in the younger and older layers above or below. This means that the tracks offer an unparalleled opportunity to see what dinosaurs were stomping around alongside each other during a narrow window in time.\n\nThis was no dinosaur dance floor, though. Back when raptors stalked and ankylosaurs shuffled around, Hunt Foster says, the area was a large mudflat with a shallow lake with a coating of algae blanketing the mud. And while well never know how the dinosaurs felt about the sensation of algae and mud squishing between their toes, this combination of factors provided the perfect mix of circumstances to preserve tracks.\n\nThe algae, in particular, were critical. The algal mat that covered the mud helped to preserve the detail of the tracks when a finer grained  sediment washed over the mudflat,\u00a0Hunt Foster says, burying the site. This preserved the imprints in great detail, she adds, noting that the algal covering helped to keep the finer details of the tracks, such as the impact rims made when the animals stepped into the soft mud, along with foot pad impressions, from being eroded away or damaged during this covering event. The effect is ghostly, prehistoric footprints recording ancient steps in pale blue stone.\n\nWorking with other local organizations, the Bureau of Land Management recently erected a boardwalk over the tracksite and interpretive signs to help visitors understand what they are seeing. Theres no hiking required herejust a stroll down from the nearby parking lot. But accessibility brings its own challenges. Many of the tracks are breaking down from having people walk on the surface, Hunt Foster says. The public lands office worries that some visitors might try to brush off the tracks or even make plaster casts that damage the footprints, which people have done at other sites. Therefore, local BLM offices are emphasizing a Respect and Protect program to help stop such vandalism, asking visitors to stay on designated trails and leave these ancient monuments as they find them.\n\nThanks to the researchers and volunteers who have cared for the site, though, more than 200 tracks lay exposed to the sun for the first time in 112 million years. They are not a static monument to life gone by. Each step, each trackway, is fossilized behavior, delicately recording dinosaurs as they ran, plodded and strutted through life. Standing on the boardwalk surrounding the exposed stone, all you have to do is fill in those steps with your imagination."}, {"title": "Human Diseases May Have Doomed the Neanderthals", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "April 12, 2016", "doc": "In the last decade, researchers have realized that the interactions between ancient humans and Neanderthals were much more complicated than previously believed. Not only did Homo sapiens compete with Neanderthals for resources, we extensively interbred with our hominid cousins, an inter species hookup that gave some modern humans one to four\u00a0percent of Neanderthal\u00a0DNA. A new study shows that humans likely gave Neanderthals something too tropical diseases. The study, published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology suggests that waves of ancient\u00a0humans traveling out of Africa and into the Neanderthals stronghold in Europe probably passed along bugs like tuberculosis, herpes, tapeworms, and stomach ulcers. Humans migrating out of Africa would have been a significant reservoir of tropical diseases, study author Charlotte Houldcroft of Cambridge Universitys Division of Biological Anthropology says in a press release. For the Neanderthal population of Eurasia, adapted to that geographical infectious disease environment, exposure to new pathogens carried out of Africa may have been catastrophic. It was assumed many infectious diseases evolved after the development of agriculture, which allowed humans to crowd together in cities and put them in regular contact with domestic animals. But recent studies of infectious disease genomes reveal that they developed tens of thousands or millions of years earlier. Though the researchers found no direct evidence for transmission of disease between humans and Neanderthals, the paper suggests that these new timelines for diseases means its highly likely humans carried them when they migrated into Neanderthal territory. Melissa Hogenboom at the BBC points out that researchers thought that Heliobacter pylori, the bug that causes stomach ulcers appeared about 8,000 years ago, soon after the beginning of agriculture. But H. pyloris genome reveals it is at least 88,000 years old. A study of Herpes Simplex 2, the cause of genital herpes, shows it was transmitted to humans from an unknown hominid 1.2 million years ago. Unlike disease transfers from Europeans to Native Americans, which led to massive epidemics like smallpox that killed millions of people in a short period of time, its more likely the disease transfer between humans and Neanderthals was much more localized, Houldcroft says. Because hunter gathers lived in small bands of about 15 to 30 people, infectious diseases would have affected one isolated band at a time, weakening their overall health. Our hypothesis is basically that each band of Neanderthals had its own personal disaster and over time you lose more and more groups, she tells Hogenboom. I dont think well ever find a single theory of what killed the Neanderthals, but there is increasing evidence that lots of things happened over a period of a few thousand years that cumulatively killed them off."}, {"title": "Researchers Piece Together Ancient Plesiosaur Attack", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "April 8, 2016", "doc": "About 70 million years ago in prehistoric South Dakota, a Hesperornis, a 3 foot tall, flightless diving bird stood on the edge of an ancient sea. All of the sudden, something lunged out of the water and grabbed the bird by the leg. Somehow, it escaped. But the signs of the attack stayed with it for the rest of its life, and were fossilized when the creature passed away. When researchers came across the fossil, housed in the Princeton University Collection at Yales Peabody Museum, they were intrigued by the marks on the tibiotarsus, and decided there were enough teeth indentations to figure out which creature attacked it. The results of their sleuthing were recently published in the journal Cretaceous Research. Researchers David Burnham of the University of Kansas and Bruce Rothschild from Northeast Ohio Medical University began their search by looking closely at the three indentations on the bone. A rough patch on the condyle, where the foot attaches, told them the bird survived the attack and suffered from an infection from the wound afterwards. The three teeth marks themselves right away ruled out shark attack, because the indentations were rounded, not flattened like a sharks bite. So the team began the process of trying to match up the marks with some of many marine predators lurking in the central U.S. during the Cretaceous. We basically did the Cinderella routine, to see whose teeth fit the slipper, Rothschild tells Laura Geggel at Live Science. The researchers began examining the fossil collection at the University of Kansas, focusing on three main suspects\u00a0mosasaurs a group of giant swimming reptile, Xiphactinus a genus of 20 foot long carnivorous fish, and plesiosaurs a genus of long necked predator that moved through the water using flippers. None of the fossils seemed to fit the bite marks until they tried the skull of a juvenile plesiosaur. The teeth lined up with the indentations in the fossil to within less than a millimeter, Burnham tells Robin Wylie for\u00a0the BBC. The orientation of the bite marks also revealed some of the details of the attack. Basically, the plesiosaur came in from the side, Rothschild tells Geggel. That probably was what allowed the bird to escape, because when the plesiosaur got the initial grip, and released to get a better grip, the bird got away. Its an interesting case, but it also adds to our knowledge of the plesiosaur more generally. Tom Stubbs from the University of Bristol tells the BBC that this study shows plesiosaurs may have had a more diverse diet than previously thought. Researchers assumed the animals used their long necks and slender snouts for grabbing fast moving fish. Marine birds were not widely considered as a potential food source, says Stubbs. The study presents compelling evidence that plesiosaurs may have been opportunistic predators."}, {"title": "Humans and Neanderthals May Have Had Trouble Making Male Babies", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "April 8, 2016", "doc": "Its well established that Homo sapiens and Neanderthals interbred when the two species met one another hundreds of thousands of years ago. In fact, studies over the last half decade show that non Africans get about 2.5 to 4 percent of their DNA from Neanderthals and that their genes are important to some immune system functions. Scientists even recently figured out roughly when and where the two species got it on. But that interbreeding was probably not as seamless as it appears, according to a new study in The American Journal of Human Genetics. There may have been some genetic incompatibility between the two species that led to miscarriages of male offspring. Carlos Bustamante, professor of biomedical data science and genetics at Stanford and his team realized that all of the Neanderthal genes found in modern humans come from X chromosomes.\u00a0They examined genes on the Y chromosome of a 49,000 year old Neanderthal male found El\u00a0Sidron, Spain, and compared them to modern human populations, but found no trace of the Neanderthal Y chromosome genes.\u00a0 Weve never observed the Neanderthal Y chromosome DNA in any human sample ever tested, Bustamante says in a press release. That doesnt prove its totally extinct, but it likely is. This led the team to investigate why the Neanderthal Y could have died out in the human populations while X linked chromosomes survived. Theres an idea that incompatibility between the genes of Neanderthals and humans did not always produce viable offspring, Fernando Mendez, lead author on the paper,\u00a0explains to\u00a0Eva Botkin Kowacki at The Christian Science Monitor. Examining the Neanderthal Y chromosome, the researchers identified four genes that could have prevented the male sex chromosome from being passed to humanNeanderthal hybrid children. Three of the genes resemble those in modern humans that can cause a mother to have an immune reaction against a male fetus, causing a miscarriage. This may have not caused a miscarriage every time. But even if the effect was weak, the Y chromosome from Neanderthals would have had a harder time being passed every generation.\u00a0Mendez tells\u00a0Botwin Kowacki. It would have been removed eventually. I think the observation that you dont see the Neanderthal Y chromosome at all is consistent with the idea that there were fitness consequences to hybridization, University of Washington geneticist Joshua Akey tells the Monitor.  Even so, more research needs to be done to say for sure if the different species could successfully produce male offspring. Bustamante and Mendez hope to do more sequencing of the Neanderthal Y chromosome to look more deeply at the probability of successful breeding between ancient humans and Neanderthals."}, {"title": "What Mummy DNA Reveals About the Spread and Decline of People in the Americas", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "April 4, 2016", "doc": "Over the last half century, researchers have assembled bits and pieces of evidence\u00a0that suggest\u00a0humans arrived in the western hemisphere by crossing a land bridge between modern day Siberia and Alaskaa explanation known as the\u00a0Berengia Theory. Proving that theory, however, has been slow going, with just a handful of archeological sites and artifacts discovered to illustrate the southward expansion. Using new genomic techniques, however, researchers patched\u00a0together the history of human expansion down the west coast of North America, tracking the populations migration. The DNA also captured the marked decline of populations throughout the Americas roughly 500 years ago\u00a0when\u00a0European settlers\u00a0and their diseases\u00a0led to a collapse of the many groups, from the Incas to North American tribes. The study is confirming a picture that has been emerging about how and when the first people arrived in the Americas, Jon Erlandson, an archaeologist at the University of Oregon tells Lizzie Wade at Science. It challenges archaeologists to catch up with the genomics people, because theyre creating models for us that need to be tested. Using samples extracted from 92 skeletons and mummies aged 500 to 8,600 years, mainly from Bolivia, Chile and Peru, researchers looked at the mitochondrial DNA of the early Americans, which is passed directly from mother to child, allowing them to track 84\u00a0lineages. They also looked at the rate of mutations in the DNA, a method that helps the scientists calculate when groups of humans split off from one another. The study,\u00a0published in the journal\u00a0Science Advances, suggests that\u00a0the earliest Americans split off from\u00a0populations in Siberia\u00a0about 23,000 years ago.\u00a0A group of roughly 10,000 people then spent about 6,000 years in isolation in Berengiaa landmass that once stretched between Russia and Alaska that was blocked by ice sheets. Then, around 16,000 years ago, the DNA shows that the population boomed, likely because the ice sheets began to recede, allowing these pioneers to spread down the west coast of the Americas and access a new host of resources. It only took about 1,500 years for humans to span the entire western hemisphere, from Alaska to southern Chile. The quick colonization means early settlers likely used boats to travel the coast. The analysis also suggests that\u00a0most of the groups were content to stay where they were. Instead of traveling and mixing lineages, most populations created their own communities and bred among themselves. That remained the status quo until about 500 years ago. When Europeans arrived, Bastien Llamas, a geneticist at the University of Adelaide and an author of the study explains, some of those populations were wiped out completely. In fact, none of the 84 sample lineages have been found in living people, though researchers admit South American populations have not been sampled very well and there is a chance some of the mitochondrial DNA lives on. We knew that Native Americans living today have a relatively low genetic diversity, Llamas tells Eva Botkin Kowacki at The Christian Science Monitor. Meaning it is highly likely that some time in the past, they lost some of their genetic diversity in what we call a bottleneck. Was it because of Europeans? Or was it because of the very early events that led to the peopling of the Americas? Llamas suggests that the answer is likely a combination of the two. Researchers estimate that 50 to 90 percent of the indigenous population of the Americas died off in the centuries following contact with European explorers, decimated by diseases like smallpox, which spread rapidly across the hemisphere and was sometimes used to infect native populations on purpose. While the paper sheds new light on the history of people in the Americas, its also important for showing how genetics and archeology can work hand in hand. I think that DNA in archeology is just going to get stronger as time goes on and I would hope that more archeologists would begin thinking and sampling in such ways that we can explore the genetic evidence thats around us all the time, Dennis Jenkins, an archeologist at the University of Oregon tells Botkin Kowakcki. Its going to become a really great tool for archeology."}, {"title": "Stop Making Fun of Tyrannosaurs\u2019 Tiny Arms", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "March 31, 2016", "doc": "We often ridicule what we love, and, in the realm of dinosaurs, that may explain our complicated relationship with the late, great Tyrannosaurus rex. The gigantic carnivore is the A list celebrity of the Mesozoic, making repeated appearances on the silver screen as well as holding an obligatory presence in most museum exhibits. Yet, we just cant stop ourselves from poking fun at the tyrants dinky arms. Maybe, though, its time we stifle our laughter. Youd expect that any saurian that lived up to the title of apex predator would have had burly arms tipped in wicked, curved claws. But instead, the king of the lizards bears nothing more than a pair of two fingered stubs. The ferocity of the dinosaur is always undercut by the silliness of its twiddly little forelimbs.\n\nT. rex isnt even the most extreme of the stubby armed carnivorous dinosaurs. The Jurassic Ceratosaurus also had comparatively tiny arms with little, stubby clawed fingers that would have been little help at all in catching or killing anything, as paleontologists Matthew Carrano of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and Jonah Choiniere of the University of Witwatersrand pointed out in a recent paper in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. This sharp toothed dinosaur must have been all mouth when hunting. Its later relative Carnotaurus took the trend even further. While the entire dinosaur measured about 30 feet long, its arms were no longer then yours, the fingers and bones of the lower arm mashed together into a useless mitt that confirm Carnotaurus was not much for upper body workouts.\n\nBut we may have been looking at these dinosaurs all wrong. To the eyes of University of Southern California paleontologist Michael Habib, its the predatory dinosaurs with longer arms and giant claws, such as the Jurassic era Allosaurus, that dont make sense.\n\nEveryone jabs at T. rex, but Allosaurus arms were awfully out of the way, too, Habib says. The Jurassic carnivores relatively longer arms and larger claws look more impressive, yet their superiority has always been assumed rather than demonstrated. In Habibs view, this has given us a skewed view of how these dinosaurs hunted. There is actually no way to get the hands of\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0anywhere near its mouth, Habib says, meaning that these dinosaurs would have to attack impossibly large prey in order to use both teeth and claws in tandem. More than that,\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0and similarly equipped dinosaurs probably couldnt even see their arms while on the hunt. For these carnivores to use their arms at all, Habib says, they would have to miss with the mouth, keep charging forward, hit the prey animal hard with its chest and then try to grab it blindly with arms that were not especially flexible or dexterous. Bigger might not be better after all. While the smaller arms of dinosaurs like\u00a0Tyrannosaurus\u00a0and\u00a0Ceratosaurus\u00a0might be good for a laugh, Habib notes that there are biomechanical reasons why smaller limbs may have the advantage. The bones of the chest and shoulder, such as the coracoids and scapula, are anchor points for muscles going into the arm, Habib says, but they are also anchor points for neck muscles. Only so much muscle can attach to any given bone. But by reducing the size of the arms and the muscles needed to move them, evolution may have allowed dinosaurs like\u00a0Tyrannosaurus\u00a0to allot more space to the neck muscles that gave them devastating bites. Keeping the bones around the chest and shoulder large, while reducing the forelimbs, provided more room for big neck muscles, which actually makes a lot of sense for predators that relied on large heads as their primary weapons, Habib says. Think less lion, and more hyena or wild dog.\n\nIf shorter arms were better for big, knife toothed dinosaurs, though, this raises the question of why\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0and similar dinosaurs werent shaped like\u00a0Tyrannosaurus. One possibility, Habib says, is that dinosaurs like\u00a0Allosaurus\u00a0hunted and fed in such a way that they did not require super powerful bites. They could have been jaw slashers or grabbers that focused on small to medium prey, Habib says, and so there just wasnt pressure to evolve more powerful neck muscles. Its also possible that dinosaurs with longer torsos could use their arms for a bit of a push while getting up from a nap, but theres no definitive answer just yet.\n\nMuch remains unknown about the way our favorite snaggletoothed dinosaurs went about hunting and killing prey. The discrepancy Habib sees is a brain teaser that awaits detailed study, even as comparative anatomy hints that carnivorous dinosaurs behaved differently than we immediately expect. Thats the difficulty of being over 66 million years too late to watch them in action. But for now, Habib says, we should give\u00a0Tyrannosaurus\u00a0a break. The key bit isnt that it had small arms, but that it had an enormous head That giant set of bone crushing, muscle rending jaws was made possible, in part, by having small arms. And this, Habib says, made\u00a0T. rex\u00a0a tougher animal, not a weaker one."}, {"title": "305-Million-Year-Old Fossil Helps Unravel the Spider\u2019s Evolutionary Web", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "March 30, 2016", "doc": "Decades ago, amateur fossil hunter Daniel Sotty was exploring a fossil bed in Montceau les Mines in eastern France when he came across what looked like a tiny spider fossil. When researchers examined the find, however, they realized it wasnt a spider at all. Now, this 305 million year old spider look alike is helping scientist learn how our modern 8 legged web spinners came to be. When I first saw it, I was unsure what kind of arachnid it was,\u00a0University of Manchester paleontologist\u00a0Russell Garwood, who worked on the fossil tells Brian Switek at National Geographic. The legs and entire front half of the body were buried in the rock. When\u00a0Garwoods team, who recently published their results in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, performed a CT scan and examined the 3 D model of creature, they realized it was unlike other invertebrates. This fossil is the most closely related thing we have to a spider that isnt a spider, Garwood tells Jonathan Webb at the BBC. Dubbed\u00a0Idmonarachne\u00a0brasieri\u00a0after\u00a0Idmon,\u00a0Arachne\u00a0the weavers father in Greek mythology, the invertebrate has eight legs and fangs like a spider. But\u00a0the creature\u00a0has a segmented abdomen and was\u00a0probably only able to squirt silk globs as opposed to the delicate threads of modern spiders. The reason? Idmonarchne\u200b\u200b\u00a0lacks an organ called a spinneret, which spiders use to direct the silk and weave elaborate webs. Idmonarchne is similar to other ancient spider relative known uraraneids, which likely used its sticky silk to line burrows or wrap up their eggs. Idmonarchne falls along the line of evolution towards true spiders, arachnologist\u00a0Jonathan\u00a0Coddington\u00a0of the Smithsonians\u00a0National Museum of Natural History tells Switek. It implies a fairly neat set of transitions to true silk production.\u00a0 The earliest known spider is actually from the same fossil depositand it definitely has spinnerets, Garwood tells Webb. So what were actually looking at is an extinct lineage that split off the spider line some time before 305 million years ago, and those two have evolved in parallel. But because the specimen is only 0.6 to 0.8 inches long, Garwood had to make sure that the spinnerets hadnt simply fallen out. So he sent the specimen the Diamond synchrotron, a specialized scanner in England that can pick up tiny details. The results did not show any holes where spinnerets could have been. Garwood tells The Guardian thats what really separates Idmonarchne from the long reign of modern spiders. The key innovation of spiders is the spinnerets, he says, and that is probably responsible for their massive success."}, {"title": "New Study Details Interbreeding of Ancient Humans With Evolutionary Cousins", "author": "Jason Daley", "date": "March 18, 2016", "doc": "Scientists have known for a while that early humans interbred with their ancient Neanderthal and Denisovan\u00a0cousins.\u00a0Chunks of their DNA can still be\u00a0found in most non African\u00a0populations. But just how often and where this interbreeding took place has remained a mysteryuntil now. A new study published in the journal\u00a0Science is starting to unravel that timeline, showing that the periods of mating between evolutionary cousins took place multiple times over a 60,000 year period on several different continents. Cari Romm at The Atlantic reports that researchers analyzed the DNA from 1,523 modern people\u00a0of various ethnic backgrounds. Using\u00a0a new statistical method, the team classified which DNA came from Neanderthals or Denisovans and whether that ancient DNA came from one encounter or separate periods of interbreeding. The study led to an interesting chronology, writes Ann Gibbons\u00a0for\u00a0Science Magazine.\u00a0It revealed\u00a0that most of the ancient DNA in Melanesiansthe people who live in\u00a0Papua New Guinea and the surrounding islands in the South Pacificcame from Denisovans, a close cousin of the Neanderthal known from some molars and a single pinky bone found in a cave in Siberia. While researcher knew Melanesians had Denisovan DNA, they did not think the percentage would be so high, roughly 1.9 to 3.4 percent of their total genome. Melanesians also have Neanderthal DNA from one encounter period, which probably took place soon after Homo sapiens left Africa. Its thought the Melanesian ancestors then moved on, picking up the Denisovan DNA somewhere in Asia. Thats pretty strange, Joshua Akey, a population geneticist at the University of Washington in Seattle and a lead author on the study tells Charles Q. Choi at LiveScience. What we know of Denisovans comes from a pinky bone from a cave in northern Siberia, yet the only modern human population with appreciable levels of Denisovan ancestry is a couple of thousand miles away from that cave, in Melanesia. A second tryst with Neanderthals is recorded in the DNA of Europeans, South Asians and East Asians, which likely took place somewhere in the Middle East. The genome also shows that East Asians had a third dalliance with Neanderthals sometime after breaking away from Europeans and South Asians. The most exciting new thing about the paper is that it confirms that there have been multiple Neanderthal introgression events independently on several different human evolutionary lineages, Rasmus Nielsen, a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, not involved in the project, tells Eva Botkin Kowaki at The Christian Science Monitor. Instead of thinking of Neanderthal admixture as something that happened just once or twice, we are now forced to consider the possibility that there has been extensive admixture between Neanderthals and humans in the entire range in which they overlapped. The interspecies breeding may have also helped Homo sapiens gain a few useful genes as they radiated out of Africa reports Gibbons. As early humans moved north and east, they encountered new climates, new food sources, and new diseases. Mating with Neanderthals and Denisovans may have given them the genetic tools to survive. In fact, the researchers identified 21 chunks of ancient DNA in modern humans which include genes that recognize viruses, help handle blood glucose and code for proteins that break down fat. The immune system is a pretty frequent target of evolution, Akey tells Choi. As our ancestors were spreading to new environments all over the world, hybridization would have provided an efficient way to pick up copies of genes adapted to local environmental conditions, and immune related genes probably helped our ancestors handle new pathogens they were exposed to. Needless to say the human gene pool is getting deeper and over the next couple years scientists may learn that it is even more jumbled than we thought. Carl Zimmer at The New York Times points out a report released last month in Genome Research indicating that pieces of DNA in African pygmies come from an unknown ancestor that mated with humans within the last 30,000 years. Akeys team will soon take a look at that too, adding another unexpected branch to the increasingly full human family tree."}, {"title": "Pint-Sized Lizards Trapped in Amber Give Clues to Life 100 Million Years Ago", "author": "Maya Wei-Haas", "date": "March 4, 2016", "doc": "Nearly 100 million years ago, the tropical forests of the mid Cretaceous period were hoppingwinged beasts commanded the skies, large reptiles swaggered on land and insects buzzed around flowering plants that were just starting to flourish. Yet until now, little was known about small tropical lizards, whose fragile bones quickly disappeared when buried in the damp forest floors. Now, scientists sifting through museum collections have described a dozen of these pint sized reptiles all entombed in amber. The hapless lizards were caught in the sticky resin of ancient coniferous trees and remained suspended until the present dayseveral in exquisite condition with claws, bones, teeth, toe pads and even scales intact. These spectacular fossils give scientists a peek into life of the diminutive denizens of the mid Cretaceous. The fossils were actually discovered decades ago in a Burmese mine\u00a0but remained in private collections until they were recently made available for study\u00a0through the American Museum of Natural History, which gave scientists access. Using CT scanners to image the fossils, the researchers could digitally dissect the lizards without harming the amber droplets, says postdoctoral student Edward Stanley, co author of the new paper. What did they find? A nice smattering of diversity, he says. The set includes creatures similar to modern day geckos and chameleons, as well as a range of species that sport a mash up of features from both ancient and modern reptile relatives, according to the study published Friday in Science Advances. These animals help fill in the patchy evolutionary history of pint sized lizards. This diverse lizard assemblage shows that back in the day, the tropics were as lizard friendly as they are today, says Stanley. Such wide variation is not necessarily unexpected, says\u00a0Kevin de Queiroz, curator of the reptile and amphibian collection at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. Theres a fair amount of diversity in the tropics now, he says. So its not too surprising that theyve been diverse in the past. Even so, capturing this diversity in the fossil record is less common, says de Queiroz. The fossil record is strongly biased to large animals living in particular environments that can preserve creatures after their death, like deserts or riverbeds. The damp, hot climate in the tropics rarely preserves small and delicate fossilsunless the unfortunate creatures become trapped in tree resin. This ancient group therefore paints a much more complete picture of minute mid Cretaceous reptiles than scientists have seen before. One of the reptiles, a dime sized baby relative of the chameleon, is the oldest discovered representative of that lineage, beating out the previous title holder by nearly 80 million years. Chameleons closest relative is the\u00a0agamidaea group that includes the bearded dragon lizards. Based on genetic evidence, chameleons were thought to have split from these relatives around the mid Cretaceous period, but fossil evidence from this time had been lacking until now. The fossils also help sort out when many of the modern reptile traits appeared. The tiny chameleon like fossil shows early development of the lizards ballistic tonguesevidenced by the presence of a large bone that supports the modern chameleons sticky weapon, says Stanley. But the fossil did not have the specialized claw like fused toes modern chameleons use to hang onto branches. Similarly, one of the\u00a0gecko relatives has preserved toe pads with the modern designs already present. We actually have a really good representation of what we have today, says Stanley, just 100 million years ago. Editors Note 3142016 This article has been updated to reflect that the fossils were not actually donated to the museum, but are still held in private collections. In an e mail, however, the museum noted that one private collector recently offered to donate several specimen. In addition, the nicely preserved gecko is on long term\u00a0loan\u00a0and they expect that it will definitely be deposited in a major natural history museum, likely the AMNH."}, {"title": "440-Million-Year-Old Fossilized Fungi May Be The Oldest Land Dwellers Yet Discovered", "author": "Danny Lewis", "date": "March 3, 2016", "doc": "Before the first fishy creatures stepped\u00a0onto Earths shores, the land had to become a hospitable place for life\u00a0to thrive. It took billions of years for\u00a0Earths surface to morph from that\u00a0barren wasteland. But the details of that transition recorded in the fossil record are sketchy at best. Now, researchers believe they might have found ancient tiny fungi fossil remainscreatures that could have paved the way for future life. According to a new study published in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, the fossilized fungi, called Tortotubus, lived about 440 million years ago. While it is difficult to precisely date the ancient creatures due to their tiny size and age, says\u00a0Martin Smith, study\u00a0author and paleontologist\u00a0at Durham University, it is unlikely that the fungi are\u00a0younger than the previous oldest fossil, which is roughly 5 million years younger. These arent necessarily the first organism to live on land, but\u00a0researchers believe the fungi\u00a0could be\u00a0the oldest fossils of a land living organisms\u00a0yet discovered,\u00a0Rachel Feltman writes for the Washington Post.\u00a0 Scientists believe that the first organisms to colonize the land probably began creeping out of the oceans between 500 and 450 million years ago during the Paleozoic era. Meaning that the fungi may have been among\u00a0the earliest organisms to thrive on land, Brooks Hays writes for United Press International. During the period when this organism existed, life was almost entirely restricted to the oceans nothing more complex than simple mossy and lichen like plants had yet evolved on the land, Smith\u00a0said in a statement. But before there could be flowering plants or trees, or the animals that depend on them, the processes of rot and soil formation needed to be established. By examining hundreds of the tiny fossils, Smith found that\u00a0Tortotubus\u00a0may have helped set the stage for future land life. The fungis branching mycelium networks it used to feed held the\u00a0soil together, allowing plants to take hold. The creature\u00a0also munched\u00a0on decomposing organic matter, which recycled nutrients back into the soil, Feltman reports. At the time though, organic matter organic was likely scarce. So\u00a0Smith says\u00a0Tortotubus\u00a0probably also fed on algae and bacteria.\u00a0Even so, its unlikely that researchers will find surviving specimens of its food. This isnt the first time Tortotubus specimens have been found. In fact, scientists have been examining their traces since the species\u00a0was\u00a0discovered in the 1980s. However, Tortotubus fossils are incredibly tiny, even smaller than a human hair. So it took scientists decades to scrounge up enough evidence to begin to understand\u00a0the\u00a0ancient fungis appearance and behavior, Becky Ferreira reports for Motherboard. Its like having the individual stills from a movie, Smith tells Ferreira. Suddenly, there are enough of the stills that you can play the movie and you can see the developmental trajectory. This find shows that with just the right conditions, some amazing creatures can be preserved and just goes to show that many more may still be out there waiting to be found.\u00a0Ill certainly be keeping my eyes peeled, looking at older rocks, now that weve pushed the fossil record back further,\u00a0Smith tells\u00a0Feltman."}, {"title": "New Species of Prehistoric Flower Discovered Preserved in Amber", "author": "Danny Lewis", "date": "February 17, 2016", "doc": "The delicate structures of flowers rarely fossilize, but the sticky resin of trees can capture these dainty specimen, preserving them for tens of millions of years. Scientists recently found two of\u00a0such\u00a0fossils, which turned\u00a0out to be a new species that may have been a poisonous predecessor to modern plants like coffee and potato. Scientists discovered the pair of rare fossil flowers\u00a0in a mine in the Dominican Republic, according to a new study published this week\u00a0in the journal\u00a0Nature Plants. Dubbed\u00a0Strychnos\u00a0electri,\u00a0these tiny beauties belong to a group of flowers called asterids, which includes such varied members as coffee, potatoes, peppers, sunflowers, and the poisonous strychnine tree, Annalee Newitz writes for Ars Technica. The specimens are beautiful, perfectly preserved fossil flowers, which at one point in time were born\u00a0by plants that lived in a steamy tropical forest with both large and small trees, climbing vines, palms, grasses and other vegetation, study author and Oregon State University researcher George Poinar, Jr. said in a statement.  The two flowers are very tiny, about a centimeter long apiece. But while Poinar and his colleagues know the plants are somewhere in the ballpark of tens of millions of years old, they are still not clear on exactly how old they are,\u00a0Mary Beth Griggs writes for\u00a0Popular Science. While\u00a0researchers can date fossils preserved in rock\u00a0by analyzing where it was found and the radioactive decay of certain elements contained in the rocks around them, amber is harder to to date because it is made from fossilized tree resin. In order to figure out how old these fossilized flowers were, Poinar had to rely on other life forms found alongside the amber encased specimens, particularly a couple of common single celled organisms called foraminifera and coccoliths. Because the evolutionary paths of these tiny animals are distinctive and well known, scientists often used them to date fossil specimens by proxy, Newitz writes. However, in this case the tests were somewhat inconclusive each test gave different results, suggesting that the flowers were fossilized anywhere between as early as 45 million years ago and as recently as 15 million years ago.  Poinar may not know exactly how long ago\u00a0Strychnos electri\u00a0thrived, but its possible it was somewhat poisonous. Species of the genus Strychnos are almost all toxic in some way, Poinar said. Some are more toxic than others, and it may be that they were successful because their poisons offered some defense against herbivores. Today, there are about 200 species of Strychnos plants, some of which are the sources of some of the worlds deadliest poisons, like strychnine and curare. Its impossible to know if or how poisonous\u00a0Strychnos electri\u00a0was, but Poinar hopes this discovery will help shed new light on what the Americas forests were like millions of years ago, long before North and South America were joined by a land bridge, Newitz writes. Specimens such as this are what give us insights into the ecology of ecosystems in the distant past, Poinar said in a statement. It shows that the asterids, which later gave humans all types of foods and other products, were already evolving many millions of years ago."}, {"title": "The Prehistoric Buzz Shark Has a Modern-Day Hero in Artist Ray Troll", "author": "Becca Cudmore", "date": "January 29, 2016", "doc": "Paleo artist Ray Trolls obsession began way back in 1993, when he spotted what he calls a strange doorstop in the basement of the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum. It was a beautiful whorl I thought it was a big snail, he says now, recollecting the moment when he visited the museum for a book he was working on. In reality, his guide explained, the fossilized spiral was the jaw of an ancient shark. Little did Troll know, this rocky jaw would consume his mind over the next 20 years, just as it had done with scientists before him. The strange tooth whorl belonged to the Helicoprion genus, the buzz sharks a moniker Troll introduced in 2012.\u00a0The bizarre beasts\u00a0swam Earths waters\u00a0some 270 million years ago, persisting for about 10 million years. Russian geologist Alexander Karpinsky discovered the first\u00a0Helicoprion in 1899 in Russiahe imagined\u00a0the whorl as a fused together coil of teeth that curled up over the sharks snout. Throughout the early 1900s an American geologist, Charles Rochester Eastman, made the case that it was instead a defense structure on the creatures back. Since these early postulations, no one has been able to perfectly position the more than two foot wide\u00a0spiral of knife like tips. Smithsonian scientists were even pretty sure that the whorl belonged deep in the sharks throat. The thought of this century old fossil enigma was too alluring for the artist to ignoreinstantly, Troll was hooked. About a week after his museum visit, he cold called the worlds authority at the time on Paleozoic sharks, Rainer Zangerl. Sporting an MFA in studio arts from Washington State University, Troll, now 61, most likely seemed a poor candidate for interpreting paleontological discoveries. But since his first sketch of a dinosaur crayons were my first medium, Troll has\u00a0demonstrated an irresistible affinity for the extinct and the living, particularly fish. Starting in the 1970s, he began blending his own flavor of surrealism with humor and biology. One 1984 drawing depicts a cluster of fish nearly nipping a bare bunned human from below. The caption reads Bottom Fish. Another piece portrays two golden orange fish hovering above the ocean, staring at each other in the moonlight Snappers In Love. Perhaps the most popular\u00a0design, Spawn Til You Die, pictures two belly up salmon and crossbones. By 1995, his first major touring museum exhibitDancing to the Fossil Recordwas working its way across the country,\u00a0featuring drawings, fish tanks, fossils\u00a0and a soundtrack and dance floor. I just made a career out of shedding light on these animals, Troll says. When Troll met with Zangerl, the scientist was very patient and he mentored me, Troll recalls. Zangerl introduced him to all sorts of ancient shark species and directed Troll to another expert Danish scientist Svend Erik Bendix Almgreen, who had studied Helicoprion extensively and hypothesized decades earlier that the whorl belonged along the beasts bottom jaw. Throughout the late 90s and into the 21st century, Trolls drawings slowly shifted from a diversity of salmon, snappers and rockfish printed in magazines, books, t shirts and as murals commissioned by NOAA and Californias Monterey Bay Aquarium to a lot of sharks\u00a0in both natural and surreal settings. My interest in Paleozoic sharks was at a peak, he says. The first time Troll put a\u00a0Helicoprion\u00a0to paper was for a book he was working on called\u00a0Planet Ocean. Thanks to his newfound shark knowledge from The\u00a0Helicoprion\u00a0Masters, as he refers to Zangerl and Almgreen, Troll became the first person to draw a believable buzz shark. His depiction led to his 1998 appearance on the Discovery Channels Prehistoric Sharks segment featuring paleontologist Richard Lund. Troll kept in touch with Almgreen for reference help and\u00a0by 2001\u00a0he was publishing a kids alphabet book,\u00a0Sharkabet, which also turned into a traveling exhibit. It featured a full swath of drawings of the beasts past and present.\u00a0Helicoprion, of course, was in all of its circular saw glory, pursuing a thin fish and accompanying the letter H. \u00a0 By 2007, Troll had moved on to fantastical map making with his book\u00a0Cruisin The Fossil Freeway\u00a0also a touring exhibit with author Kirk Johnson, currently the director of the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. Recounting and mapping their 5,000 mile road trip, the book strings together the layered fossil history of the American West and within it, the ever elusive fossilized tooth whorls of\u00a0Helicoprion,\u00a0paleo blogger\u00a0and Smithsonian.com contributor Brian Switek\u00a0wrote\u00a0in his review of the book. Sure, theres a whole host of beasties and creatures that Im enamored with, Trolls says but\u00a0Helicoprion\u00a0became one of my favorite characters in the story of my life. Twenty years after his introduction to the fossil, Troll has reviewed the literally hundreds of drawings of\u00a0Helicoprion\u00a0and turned them into a traveling exhibit of his madness. The show began in 2013\u00a0in Idaho, a state rich with\u00a0Helicoprion\u00a0fossils, as these sharks once swam in the Paleozoic ocean waters that covered much of the Northern Hemisphere. Unraveling the Mystery of the Buzz Sharks of Idaho became The Summer of Sharks in Alaska and The Buzz Sharks of Long Ago in Washington. Its current home lies within the Museum of Natural and Cultural History on the University of Oregons campus. The exhibit touts jaw replicas and Trolls own whimsical whorl depictions, like big yellow spirals that resemble tribal symbols of the sun with scribbled numbers above each tooth. Up to 180 teeth can exist in one whorl, Troll says. His more recent pieces depict a single human silhouette, himself no doubt, tumbling through a skyful of multicolored whorls. Trolls passion, however, has served a purpose far beyond the aesthetic charm of a framed pictureit has\u00a0shaped the scientific communitys knowledge of\u00a0Helicoprion\u00a0itself. Back in the mid 1990s, when he wrote and spoke with Almgreen, Troll discovered that the scientist had published his hypothesis about the buzz sharks physiology in an obscure paper in 1966. This knowledge remained hidden, lost to memory even to prominent paleontologists, until 2010, when an undergraduate student working as an intern at the Idaho Museum of Natural History got in touch with Troll. Jesse Pruitt had come across the museums\u00a0Helicoprion\u00a0collection during an introductory tour, and he recognized the fossil from a Shark Week episode that had aired on the Discovery Channel a few months before. He asked the collections manager about the whorls. She recalled that Troll had loaned a couple out from the museum for an exhibit and suggested that I should contact him, Pruitt says. Right away, Troll told me to find the Almgreen paper and look for Idaho 4, the name of a fossil in the museums collections. At this point, Pruitts advisor paleontologist Leif Tapanila became interested as well. I hadnt seen the original paper before that, Tapanila says. Idaho 4, the very fossil that Almgreen used to make his own hypothesis, would be integral, Troll assured the duo, if one wanted new insights and finally establish that the whorl was in the lower jaw. Publishing their findings in a landmark 2013\u00a0Biology Letters\u00a0paper, Tapanilas team used CT scans of Idaho 4 to\u00a0reveal\u00a0a view that Almgreen couldnt see in the 60s. Inside this fossil, they discovered all the parts of\u00a0Helicoprions upper and lower jaw, which led to their reconstruction of the whorl that partly confirms Almgreens original hunch, Tapanila writes in the 2013 paper. Idaho 4 became the Rosetta stone of sorts for deciphering these sharks, Pruitt says. Indeed, the whorl was located on the lower jaw, just as Almgreen had suggested. But what Almgreen could not see, Tapanila says, is that it was attached to the full length of the sharks jaw. These teeth filled up its entire mouth. One of the papers more astounding findings shows that buzz sharks are\u00a0not sharks at all. The scans revealed that they\u00a0actually belong to the closely related ratfish family, ironic considering that one of Trolls many sea life obsessions over the years happens to be with ratfish.\u00a0He has one\u00a0tattooed\u00a0upon his upper bicep, and the fish\u00a0inspired the name of his band, The Ratfish Wranglers. Theres even a ratfish\u00a0species,\u00a0Hydrolagus trolli,\u00a0that was\u00a0named after him in 2002.\u00a0 Trolls comic like depictions of the long debunked\u00a0Helicoprion\u00a0hypotheses and his best take based on the new research are printed in the paper alongside Tapanilas study. Since day one, Troll was part of the science team, Tapanila says.\u00a0He puts the pieces together. The most recent illustration shows\u00a0Helicoprion\u00a0with its mouth packed full of spiral sawed teeth, reflecting the 2013 finding, which Tapanila says hes pretty sure is spot onas sure as a scientist is ever willing to say that theyre sure. Though hes played a true role in science, Troll remains unabashedly an\u00a0artist. Scientists work within strict confines, he says.\u00a0They have to be cautious. They know where\u00a0Helicoprion\u00a0fits in the family tree now, but they still need to learn what this ratfish looked like. No ones ever seen the bodyall we have are the whorls, Troll says,\u00a0and thats where I come in. Trolls Buzz Sharks of Long Ago will be on exhibit at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History for the summer of 2016 and at The Museum of The Earth in Ithaca, New York, the following year.

Workers were excavating the site for a future locker room as part of a plan to expand the Reser Stadium in Corvallis, Oregon. The\u00a0cache of bones waited\u00a0just 10 feet below the surface and when a\u00a0construction worker uncovered the massive femur, all work ceased\u00a0and the crew immediately notified OSU officials. In the days since, archaeologists discovered bones that belonged to ancient bison and camels alongside the mammoth remains, Joseph Rose reports for The Oregonian. There are quite a few bones, and dozens of pieces, Loren Davis, an associate professor of anthropology at OSU who was called to the site after the initial discovery was made, says in a statement. Some of the bones are not in very good shape, but some are actually quite well preserved. The bones are believed to be about 10,000 years old, though more testing needs to be done before experts can be certain. While OSU officials had no idea what was lying underneath the football stadium, its not uncommon for people to come across ancient animal remains throughout the Willamette Valley, which was once a popular trail for wooly mammoth herds, Rose writes. Archaeologists arent sure how the ice age mammals passed, but its possible that they traveled to an ancient bog to die, Davis says in a statement. Animals who were sick would often go to a body of water and die there, so its not unusual to find a group of bones like this, Davis said. We had all of these types of animals in the Willamette Valley back then.  Archaeologists examining the site havent found any human bones or remains, which could suggest that the animals werent killed during a human hunt. However, this also means that under Oregon state law, the find is not protected as an archaeological site and construction is likely to continue on schedule,\u00a0Bryan Altman reports for\u00a0CBS Seattle. For now, workers have moved on to\u00a0a different step of the stadiums renovation, but aim to have the project completed by the start of the 2016 football season. The find may not be stopping construction, but the university is treating the site as a paleontological find and has closed it off to the public,\u00a0Sarah Berger reports for\u00a0International Business Times. Meanwhile, Davis and his team are continuing to excavate the site, hoping to learn more about the ancient ecosystem of the Willamette Valley in the process. It just goes to show theres a whole world of the past that exists underground, Davis tells Rose. Its so neat we could find it here at Reser Stadium.

The park is about a three hour drive from Reno, says paleontologist Neil Kelley of Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. After you pass through the small town of Fallon, you can easily drive the remaining two hours without seeing another vehicle. But theres something very special about this isolated spot that has drawn a multi institution team of paleontologists into the Nevada desert The park houses a 217 million year old murder mystery.\n\nThe parks name comes in part from a massive bone bed that has puzzled scientists since its discovery in 1928. Excavations in the 1950s and 60s by University of California, Berkeley paleontologists Charles Camp and Samuel Welles revealed that the site boasts nearly 40 individuals of one of the largest marine reptiles of all time. These ichthyosaurs, named Shonisaurus popularis by Camp, could reach 49 feet in length, and the paleontologists undertaking the original excavations suspected that the dense accumulation was a mass stranding similar to what happens to whales today.\n\nBut continuing work at the site didnt support Camps idea. The preservation of the bodies and the details of the rock they were found in showed that they had been deposited in deep water, not on the shore, so something else must have happened to the ichthyosaurs. Some sort of deadly algae bloom seemed like a good candidate. And more recently, one researcher jumped into the deep end of speculation to suggest the ichthyosaurs had been killed by an enormous squid, which carefully arranged the bones in its lair. All the while, the true story of what happened has remained in the rock.\n\nNow Kelley and colleagues are taking another crack at the site. The inspiration for this new effort came from recent work by Kelleys fellow Smithsonian scientist and collaborator Nick Pyenson. During the widening of the Pan American Highway from 2010 to 2012, workers uncovered a mass death assemblage of marine mammals in Cerro Ballena, Chile. Pyenson, a fossil whale expert, quickly alerted the Smithsonians 3D Digitization team, who rushed to Chile and used laser scans and photographs to digitally document and preserve the discovery. The researchers thought the same techniques could easily be applied to the Berlin Ichthyosaur site, Kelley says, especially since the boneyard is a permanent public display left where it was found in the Nevada mountainside. This is where new tech meets very old bones. We have adopted a multi platform digitization approach, using medium range laser scanning, LiDAR, structured light scanning and photogrammetry to digitize the site at multiple scales, Kelley says. The result is a high resolution digital version of the bone bed that provides a pterosaurs eye view of the whole site, as well as detailed scans of the individual bones. This will not only provide key information about the fossils, but will also eventually allow people all over the world to virtually explore the bone bed through publicly released digital models. More than that, the paleontologists have also been scouting the surrounding area for additional fossils and geologic samples that may help explain the special circumstances within the quarry. As yet, the team is still poring over the maps and samples. We have some good preliminary clues and ideas to what happened to the ichthyosaurs, Kelley says, but we are still actively debating and discussing this and still investigating the data. The Shonisaurus die off wasnt the first of its kind, nor will it be the last, so figuring out what happened to the marine reptiles might do much more than help scientists piece together conditions in the late Triassic. We think that understanding the history of these events in deep time can help inform our understanding of current and future mass mortality events in marine ecosystems, and vice versa, Kelley says.\u00a0 Editors Note The photo credit for the Berlin Ichthyosaur\u200b bone bed has been corrected."}, {"title": "A Moby-Dick Emerges from the Smithsonian Collections", "author": "Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato", "date": "December 9, 2015", "doc": "The backroom storage areas of a museum are rarely visited by the public. But these facilities contain the research collectionsthe wellspring of what is presented in the galleries and exhibits. Museums all over the world have extensive collections hiding behind the scenes, cluttering back rooms and filling storage units. Skeletons, paintings and trinkets all housed and inventoried, often wait to be examined, studiedor rediscovered. Researchers at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. today announced that a rediscovery in the collections has been made. A 300 pound sperm whale fossil that had been misinterpreted as an extinct walrus almost a century ago is newly renamed\u00a0Albicetus oxymycterus, based on the\u00a0Latin for white whale albus cetus, after Herman\u00a0Melvilles classic novel Moby Dick,\u00a0the subject of the new Ron Howard film In the Heart of the Sea. The finding, which was published today in the journal PLOS ONE, will teach scientists more about the evolution of whales in our oceans, says co author Nicholas Pyenson. Not everything\u00a0in a museum is known, says Pyenson, who is a paleontologist at the Natural History Museum. I\u00a0have access to the greatest collection of modern and fossil whale\u00a0specimens. The Moby Dick fossil was first described back in 1925 by Remington Kellogg, who was working as a biologist at the Carnegie Institute. He would later become in 1958 an assistant Secretary at the Smithsonian. The fossil skull, which weighs several hundred pounds, originally came from California. Kellogg saw that the skull had a big tooth and assumed the animal was a walrus. For decades, that classification stooduntil Pyenson decided to investigate. Ten years ago when I was a student, I made a trip to the Smithsonian, and there was this big skull, and it was well worth further study because the last time anyone had published on it in was 1925, says Pyenson, who worked with the Smithsonians Digitization Program to have the whale skull, which could be up to 15 million years old, scanned and digitized. Today, that 3D scan is made available online to other scientists as well as the public. This discovery can tell us a lot about the evolution of sperm whales throughout time,\u00a0says Ari Friedlaender, a marine ecologist at Oregon State University. Scientists can compare the sperm whale fossil to other fossils, as well as todays modern sperm whales. The differences among the animals can help tell us about the worlds oceans and climate in the past. This study is a great example of how you can use the past to understand the present and how the fossil record provides us with information on how these animals evolved,\u00a0Friedlaender adds. Modern sperm whales are among the biggest animals in the world, growing up to 60 feet\u00a0long. The\u00a0Albicetus oxymycterus, however, is estimated to have only been about 19.6 feet. Why the difference in size? This is most likely due to an evolutionary arms race between the whale and its prey, says Alex Boersma, a researcher at the Smithsonian. \u00a0 Sperm whales mainly\u00a0eat\u00a0giant squid, which can be vicious creatures. Squids have powerful suction cups and sharp, deadly beaks.\u00a0Youll find sperm whales who have suction cup marks and scratch marks from the squid beak, Boersma adds. The sperm whales may have grown larger as the squids grew larger, each trying to best the other. The redescribed\u00a0fossil also has a row of upper teeth unlike the modern sperm whale, which only have teeth on their lower jaw. Todays sperm whales swallow their food whole, and the one set of teeth is more for grabbing and ripping than for chewing. But the sperm whales of yesteryear had two sets of teeth and a powerful lower jaw. This means that prehistoric whales were probably feeding on other marine animals like smaller whales and seals. They would have needed teeth for catching and eating their prey, Boersma says. Thats something we dont really see in modern whales anymore, other than the killer whale, she adds. This suggests there was some sort of shift in the evolution of sperm whales, and they changed their feeding strategy.\u00a0 The next step is to do more research and find other whale fossils from different time periods. Theres still a huge gap in the fossil record between the\u00a0Albicetus oxymycterus\u00a0and todays\u00a0sperm whales.\u00a0 The science and methodology is so meticulously detailed that it would be difficult to argue with their conclusions,\u00a0says Kathryn Davis, an environmental historian at San Jose State University.\u00a0 This was probably the most impressive part of this paper. The description of methods, technology, and attention to the original description is, I think, beyond reproach. This discovery is also a call to action for museum curators around the world. Its time to clean out those basements, open up those storage sheds and reexamine\u00a0those back rooms. Its likely that there are many more misidentified fossils, and\u00a0its up to museums to dig deeper, Davis adds. The science, the use of historical data and description, are all exciting but the possibilities are endless and that is what is really important about this article. This article should engender new excitement about re examining determinations made in the 19th century because of the possibilities for new knowledge, Davis says in an email. That might provide us with a new window on exploration of the past, evolution\u00a0and extinction. UPDATE 12102015 A previous version of this story suggested that Remington Kellogg described the fossil as a walrus. In fact, Kellogg identified it originally as a whale and subsequent research redefined the genus as a group of extinct walruses.

Discoveries of new fossil sites are often met with a combination of joy and unease, as paleontologists and public lands managers are left hoping that visitors will see the ancient elements as something to be witnessed rather than pillaged. But even though the depressing tales of fossil destruction are more likely to make headlines, there is at least one place where a more positive story is unfolding.\n\nArizonas Petrified Forest National Park is famous for the stunning, rainbow hued remnants of a Triassic forest preserved within its boundaries. It has also been regularly portrayed as a sad example of fossil theft. In the past, park rangers lamented that a ton of 225 million year old wood gets stolen from the park every month, and visitors were viewed with suspicion when they ventured into the desert. While efforts to curb fossil theft were well intentioned, everyone was being considered a potential thief rather than just visitors, says park superintendent Brad Traver. There was even a wall of shame plastered with the letters of contrite fossil thieves who later mailed back their pilfered artifacts.\n\nBut Traver and park paleontologist William Parker didnt totally buy the stories. People would say, This spot over here, this spot ten years ago was full of wood, and now its clean, Parker recalls. The trouble is that, geologically speaking, those spots were the wrong layers to have petrified wood anyway. Something else was going on. Parker regularly asked himself why he wasnt seeing the widespread theft that the park management was so concerned with. So by hiking a lot of miles and comparing new photos to historic documents, Parker went about checking whether the rumors were true.\n\nComparing photos taken in 2007 and 2012 to historic prints, he revealed that the monitored sites looked mostly the same over time. Whats more, he found that some of the missing wood may have simply been buried under paved walkways installed along certain trails. People get the same experience as if they came here in 1880, and the pictures show that, Parker says. While park law enforcement catches one to two percent of visitors stealing chips of fossilized wood, its not as if entire petrified trees are being burgled out from under the rangers noses.\n\nThis allows us to be more trusting, Parker says. So he and Traver have been working to make Petrified Forest one of the most open parks in the system. For instance, the park removed a scene from its orientation video showing a visitor being arrested for fossil theft, and its curbed more draconian activities like searching visitor vehicles and closing areas of the park.\u00a0 The letters from fossil thieves have mostly been removed as well, partly because some visitors took pieces of wood just to mail them back and get on the signboards. But the most important change is that the park is now actively encouraging visitors to go out and explore.\n\nPetrified Forest used to be a drive through park, and visitors would wind their way from one side to the other, hardly stopping to take in the scenery. These days, Traver, Parker and others have been suggesting destination hikes, where people seek out significant sites and unique vistas inside the park. The vision is a trip thats enjoyable, thats safe, and that protects our resources as well, Traver says. So far the program has been drawing a greater number of visitors into the desert each year. And other park programs have even benefitted science. During a supervised public dig earlier this year, amateur paleontologist Stephanie Leco found the jaw of a long snouted fish, the first known occurrence of the species in the park.\n\nTraver and Parker credit this success to the changed attitudes. By trusting visitors and showing them how to best enjoy the prehistoric beauty, Petrified Forest has given people a new reason to care about this slice of prehistory in the Arizona desert."}, {"title": "What Killed the Mammoths of Waco?", "author": "Megan Gannon", "date": "December 3, 2015", "doc": "For two decades, a circus tent stood on the outskirts of Waco, Texas, not far from the point where the Bosque and Brazos rivers converge. But the real elephant attraction was below Columbian mammoths, still preserved in their death pose, more than 60,000 years after floodwaters left them buried in mud.  The Waco Mammoth National Monument, its circus digs now replaced with a climate controlled shelter and visitor center, became one of the countrys newest national monuments in July. The first hints of the Ice Age graveyard were discovered by accident in 1978, when two 19 year olds looking for arrowheads along a dry riverbed found mammoth bones instead. They alerted paleontologists at Baylor University, sparking an excavation that yielded surprisingly rich finds. Within a decade, 16 Columbian mammoths were uncovered and lifted out of the ground in plaster jackets. A second phase revealed six more mammoths, a camel and the tooth of a saber tooth cat.  The deposit is unique because it preserves a nursery herdat least six adult females and ten juvenilesthat died together in a single event. Unlike the Hot Springs Mammoth Site in South Dakota, where over 60 juvenile and adolescent male Columbian mammoths plummeted to their deaths over the course of many years, the Waco site bears witness to a single, catastrophic event. And the absence of arrowheads and other archaeological remains suggests that the bones arent a heap of Paleo Indian leftoversthis was a mass grave from a natural disaster.  Howand whendid the animals die? New research found a likely answer within the sediments that entombed the creatures. The paper, which was recently published in Quaternary Research, concludes that the original 16 mammoths from the herd were likely standing in the wet, sandy sediment near the confluence of the two rivers when a storm hit. As floodwaters rose, the animals might have been trapped between the river and the ravines walls. At 12 to 14 feet tall and weighing seven to eight tons, Columbian mammoths werent exactly agile. Perhaps they couldnt climb the steep slopes to escape in time. Some might have even been trapped in a mudslide. Other mammoths seem to have died in a similar storm while visiting the same area years later.   Earlier\u00a0radiocarbon dates\u00a0had suggested that the main mammoth killing event took place about 29,000 years ago. But geologist Lee Nordt and his co authors found that the mass death was actually much earlieraround 66,000 years ago. To do so, they used a dating technique known as optically stimulated luminescence, or OSL, which measures the time since a mineral sample was last exposed to sunlight or intense heat. The new date falls within an especially chilly period when the grasslands of central Texas were about seven degrees cooler than they are today.  The difference may seem small, but over the span of many years, cooler average temperatures can affect rainfall, soil conditions and even animal growth. This could help explain why the Columbian mammothsa species better adapted to warm environments than woolly mammothslook a little stunted and slightly malnourished at Waco. Maybe its because it was a much colder period and they were struggling a little bit, Nordt tells Smithsonian.com. The animals condition lends credence to the new dateafter all, it would be harder to explain why the animals were in poor health if they died during a warmer period 29,000 years ago.  Though the mammoths appear to have died within minutes, the fossil deposits move from private hands to national monument was decades in the making. Initial excavations were kept under wraps, and in 1996, landowner named Sam Jack McGlasson donated his portion of the site to the City of Waco. Through gifts and purchases, Baylor University acquired another 100 acres around the fossils. In the mid 2000s, local advocates formed the Waco Mammoth Foundation and raised over 4.5 million to build a permanent shelter over the bones. While two bids to make it a unit of the National Park Service stalled in Congress, the site became a fully operational tourist attraction on its own. By the time U.S. Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell visited the site for its official dedication in October, she said it was like being presented a national park in a box.  To get someone to feel connected to a lump of bones is a challenge, Raegan King, manager of the site, tells Smithsonian.com. Its important for people to understand not only how these animals died but how they lived. Lucky for King, the Waco site has shed light on the elusive social lives of mammoths, who seemed to have roamed in herds much like those of modern day African elephants.  Only two and a half acres of the site have been excavated so far. King hopes future visitors will get to witness paleontology in action, as the potential for new discoveries is really, really good. In the future, says King, visitors may even be able to watch museum workers remove mammoth fossils in an on site lab.  Greg McDonald, a senior curator of natural history with the National Parks Service, agrees that theres plenty of potential for additional research. He tells Smithsonian.com that construction workers hit bone when they were putting in foundations for the permanent dig shelter, and fossils seem to erode out of the ground every time there is a rainstorm. Next, researchers hope to discover just why the site was so attractive to prehistoric animals.  Im a museum person and I love mounted skeletons, but one of the reasons why I came to the Park Service is that we can provide a broader context for seeing something in its original position that you lose once you take it out of the ground, McDonald says. I think the folks in Waco have something to be very proud of."}, {"title": "Hundreds of Dinosaur Tracks Discovered Along the Scottish Coast", "author": "Danny Lewis", "date": "December 2, 2015", "doc": "The Loch Ness Monster may be a myth, but Scotland was once home to some of the largest dinosaurs to ever walk the Earth. Recently, paleontologists uncovered\u00a0hundreds of fossilized footprints on the beach of the Isle of Skye made as giant sauropods wandered through an ancient swamp. At a glance, the find might look like a bunch of potholes worn into rocks at the oceans edge. But during the Middle Jurassic period, this site was a brackish lagoon home to long necked sauropods that grew up to 50 feet long and weighed about 20 tons, Rachel Feltman reports for the Washington Post. The new tracksite from Skye is one of the most remarkable dinosaur discoveries ever made in Scotland, University of Edinburgh paleontologist Steve Brusatte said in a statement. There are so many tracks crossing each other that it looks like a dinosaur disco preserved in stone. By following the tracks you can walk with these dinosaurs as they waded through a lagoon 170 million years ago, when Scotland was so much warmer than today. The find sheds light on a period of history that scientists know little about. The Middle Jurassic is one of the most poorly understood time intervals in dinosaur evolution because its rare to find dinosaur bones preserved in rocks from that time, Brusatte\u00a0tells Brian Switek for\u00a0National Geographic. Although its impossible for researchers to determine what species made the tracks without finding a skeleton nearby, the tracks are detailed enough that Brusatte and his colleagues could identify them as belonging to sauropods like Cetiosaurus, an early cousin of the Brontosaurus. But what really intrigued the scientists was that the footprints showed that these dinosaurs spent at least some of their time tromping through water.  Because sauropods were so massive, paleontologists assumed for years\u00a0that the long necked plant eaters couldnt support their own weight and spent most of their time wading around swamps and coastal areas, Brusatte\u00a0tells Will Dunham for\u00a0Reuters. That theory was tossed out during the 1970s and 80s when new fossil finds indicated that sauropods could wander about on land perfectly well. Now, thanks to this find and other similar fossil sites, Brusatte believes that while these dinosaurs mostly lived on land, they probably spent a fair amount\u00a0of time in the water after all. Maybe these lagoons were a ready source of food, or offered protection from predators. But regardless of the answer, this discovery and the other recent ones are inspiring us to re imagine the lifestyles of these most incredible of ancient creatures, Brusatte tells Dunham. Whatever the reason these dinosaurs were wandering around the Scottish coast, these footprints show that scientists still have a lot to learn about these giant reptiles."}, {"title": "Genetic Tweaks Are Revealing the Dinosaur Traits in Living Chickens", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "November 13, 2015", "doc": "Look out your window, and you may just spot a living dinosaur. Instead of slipping into total annihilation 66 million years ago, the avian line of dinosaurs managed to not only survive but thrive in the aftermath of a mass extinction, giving rise to modern birds. Fossils can help us trace the ways the fearsome reptiles transformed into the feathered flocks we see today. But its also possible to work backwards, using the rich evolutionary record written in birds soft tissues and genes.\n\nYale paleontologist Bhart Anjan Bhullar has been picking away at this intersection where the modern meets the prehistoric. Pairing ancient bones and tracks with an understanding of the way modern species develop, Bhullar has been using time tested evolutionary biological techniques to explore the dinosaurs transformation. At purely superficial levels, Bhullar says, the differences between ancestral dinosaurs and todays birds can seem overwhelming\u00a0 Birds are a lot smaller. The bird skull is a lot smaller, but it holds an enlarged brain, he says. They have no teeth. They actually have a very short face. They have a very different architecture.\n\nThe secret is that some of those major changes spring from relatively minor tweaks early on in an animals development. At first this seems like a million changes, Bhullar says, but it turns out that many of these changes are potentially explainable if you look at birds as potentially juvenilized versions of the ancestral dinosaur. Thats what Bhullar and colleagues concluded in a 2012 paper surveying changes in dinosaur skull shape. In work conducted while a Ph.D. student at Harvard University under advisor\u00a0Arhat Abzhanov, the team found that the large brain, big eyes and short faces of birds are all traits shared with infant dinosaurs, meaning that todays birds are baby faces.\n\nBut Bhullar hasnt stopped there. Part of the mystery of the change from bird to dinosaur has been the evolution of the beak. The upper beak of birds is built upon a single, large bone called the premaxilla. This bone is small, often has teeth and makes up just the tip of the snout in most dinosaurs. But during the evolution of birds, the paired premaxillae bones expanded and became the main skeletal anchor for a toothless beak. How did this happen?\n\nIts something to do with more specific patterning genes, Bhullar says. These are the genetic instructions that tell early embryos how cells should move around to sculpt an adult animal. As detailed in a paper published earlier this year, Bhullar and his colleagues found that making small changes to these patterning genes in chickens allowed them to re create a face more similar to that of their non avian dinosaur ancestors. The experiment resulted in chicken embryos growing to have skeletons that were in many ways more ancestral, Bhullar says. That included small, rounded jaw bones that were strikingly more like the ancestral form. In his continuation of\u00a0this work, conducted with his team at Yale, Bhullar describes\u00a0how a different jaw bone changed with the evolution of birds. This bone, the maxilla, is huge and holds most of the upper teeth in dinosaurs but is reduced to a tiny strut in birds. Paired with the previous research, the new scienceannounced at the annual Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting last monthlays out how the tip of the dinosaur snout grew to become the major part of the bird beak, while the toothiest part of the dinosaur jaw shrunk to almost nothing. Element by element, Bhullar and his colleagues are starting to understand the underpinnings of one of the most transcendent transitions in evolutionary history. Not that Bhullar is interested in creating a chickenosaurussuch proposals make headlines but would only mask the real wonder of what time and evolution have gifted us with. Weve known that animals, organisms, carry in their morphology the legacy of their histories, Bhullar says. In the tiny parts of their morphology, in the nucleic acid that forms the genome itself, there are far more featuresburdens of history, relics that are left, molecular fossilsand these perhaps represent a treasure trove of potentialities that we can use to explain the history of life, and maybe even its future."}, {"title": "Ancient Bees Were Voracious Snackers on Their Pollen-Gathering Treks", "author": "Mollie Bloudoff-Indelicato", "date": "November 12, 2015", "doc": "When scientists want to know where a honeybee has traveled, they usually just look in its pollen basket. Thats the dense region of sticky hairs on their legs where bees shove pollen grains, compacting them until they have enough to take home to feed their offspring. Sometimes the basket gets into absurd proportions, says David Grimaldi, an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History. You see them with these huge balls of pollen, and they can hardly fly. Baby bees eat the pollen, but the adults prefer nectar. Adult bees fly long distances and use up lots of energy, so they have to eat constantly. Now, analysis of pollen collected from fossilized bees suggests that the insects of yore were dining on nectar from flowers beyond those targeted for pollen collection. The findings represent the earliest evidence of a dual collection strategy in bees, where they feed their offspring pollen from one type of plant but are eating from all kinds of plants themselves, says study co author Conrad Labandeira, a paleobiologist at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History. The result could help ecologists better understand what modern bees are eating so we can protect those food sources. Were really concerned about modern day bees health and what flowers they visit, says Hannah Burrack, an entomologist at North Carolina State University who was not involved in the research. This study is important for preserving and assessing the health of the bees. For the study, published this week in Current Biology, Labandeira and a team of international colleagues looked at individual grains of pollen attached to six ancient bee species from the now extinct tribe Electrapini. The species are between 44 million and 48 million years old and were found lodged in oil shale deposits outside of Frankfurt, Germany. The scientists used tiny pieces of tape to lift pollen off the ancient bees bodies and then studied it under a microscope. They found that the pollen on their legs mainly came from the same source, while the grains on their bodies were much more diverse. Matching the pollen to ancient plants, the team found that the grains being collected for transport back to the hive came mainly from the blossoms of evergreen bushes, which all had the same basic flower structure. These flowers deposited pollen on the bees bodies in places where it was easy for them to brush the grains back onto their legs, thus maximizing their harvest. By contrast, pollen still stuck to their bodies came from all sorts of flowers, left accidentally when the bees made indiscriminant pit stops along the way.\u00a0 Modern bees likely follow similar patterns, and finding out where they are going could be crucial to their survival. Previous work suggests that bees have changed very little in the past 48 million years, Labandeira says. This means they are slow to evolve and have become very well adapted to certain conditions, so any rapid changes to an ecosystem, like introducing pesticides or extreme temperature increases, could cause an entire species to go extinct. We tend to think that things evolve in thousands of years, but were talking tens of millions of years, Grimaldi says. When you destroy habitats and then to try to rebuild them, it might never be possible because of how long its taken to establish in evolutionary time, he adds. And this new work suggests that any scientist just looking at a bees pollen basket is missing out on a big part of the insects travel patterns, Burrack says. In the future, agriculturalists should study both the bees legs and their bodies to see which flowers and plants the insects are visiting. The resulting information could help save modern day honeybees, which are important pollinators for many of the worlds crops. This study is so important, because bees are so important, Grimaldi says. No other group of insects has the ecological significance of bees. Theyre so essential to agriculture."}, {"title": "A Long-Necked Marine Reptile Is the First Known to Filter Feed Like a Whale", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "November 9, 2015", "doc": "If youve ever flipped through a book of prehistoric creatures or ambled through a major museums fossil halls, youve probably seen a plesiosaur. These were the four flippered marine reptiles that patrolled the seas for almost the entire Mesozoic era, some 250 to 66 million years ago. Some plesiosaurs were big headed apex predators. Others had ludicrously long necks and snatched up fish and crustaceans with their little jaws. Now, Marshall University paleontologist F. Robin OKeefe has discovered that some of them filled their bellies in a way thought to be impossible for the aquatic reptiles filter feeding. The findings, presented last month at the annual Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in Dallas, centered on a plesiosaur that has puzzled paleontologists for over 25 years. Named Mortuneria, this plesiosaur was found in the 66 million year old rock of Seymour Island, Antarctica. Along with a closely related animal called Artistonectes found in Chile, Mortuneria was informally called one of the hoopy jaws for its large, hoop shaped mouth that made it stand out from other known plesiosaurs, OKeefe says. Paleontologists Sankar Chatterjee and Bryan Small, who initially described Mortuneria in 1989, mooted the idea that the marine reptiles odd jaw and needle like teeth were adaptations for trapping small prey. So OKeefe went back to re describe the odd animal and seek out alternate feeding strategies. I look at it, and I was baffled, OKeefe says. But after weeks of hard work, he found that Mortuneria possessed an array of anatomical features that meant it must have been filter feeding. First of all, the teeth of Mortuneria dont interlock like they do in other plesiosaurs. The teeth of the upper jaw stick down, and the teeth of the bottom jaw stick out and down, OKeefe says. This arrangement makes a good sieving battery. More than that, the relatively slender jaws of Mortuneria would have contacted each other during a bite, indicating that theres no force to their bite. If the plesiosaur tried to chomp struggling prey, OKeefe expects its jaws would have shattered. The evidence all suggests that the marine animals must have been doing something other than trying to nab struggling prey. Along with a deep palate, which would have helped push water out of the mouth to strain out tasty morsels, these features instead indicate that Mortuneria was targeting much smaller prey than most of its relatives. OKeefe envisions Mortuneria feeding in much the same way that gray whales do today. The plesiosaur probably dipped its head down to the bottom, OKeefe speculates, scooping up mud and sifting out all the critters. Now that hes identified these filter feeding features in Mortuneria, OKeefe suspects that some earlier plesiosaurs may have pioneered the lifestyle. Kimmerosaurus from England and Tatenectes from Wyoming, both dating to the Late Jurassic, have a similar needle toothed, big mouthed look to them. Filter feeding in plesiosaurs, from the material that I know, evolved at the end of the Jurassic and went extinct, and at the end of the Cretaceous and went extinct, OKeefe says. It seems the plesiosaurs didnt just inhabit the seas, they truly ruled them, from monstrous macropredators to mud grubbing bottom feeders."}, {"title": "New Winged Dinosaur May Have Used Its Feathers to Pin Down Prey", "author": "Ker Than", "date": "November 5, 2015", "doc": "A newly discovered winged raptor may have belonged to a lineage of dinosaurs that grew large after losing the ability to fly. But being grounded likely didnt stop this sickle clawed killer from making good use of its feathered framebased on the fossilized bones, paleontologists think this raptor could have used the unusually long feathers on its arms as a shield or to help pin down squirming prey. Dubbed Dakotaraptor steini, the Cretaceous era creature was found in South Dakota in the famous Hell Creek Formation, which means it shared stomping grounds with Tyrannosaurus Rex and Triceratops around 66 million years ago. Measuring about 17 feet long, Dakotaraptor is one of the largest raptors ever found and fills a previously vacant niche for medium sized predators in the region. Paleontologists had suspected a creature might be found to fill this body size gap, but we never in our wildest dream imagined it would be a raptor like this, says study coauthor Robert DePalma, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Palm Beach Museum of Natural History. This is the most lethal thing you can possibly throw into the Hell Creek ecosystem. Based on the Dakotaraptor skeleton, DePalma and his team surmise that the animal had a lean and lithe body that excelled at running and jumping. Dakotaraptor was probably the fastest predator in the entire Hell Creek Formation, DePalma says. It was the Ferrari of raptors. Its speed, combined with a giant sickle like killing claw on each foot, would have made Dakotaraptor a formidable adversary. It could have given a juvenile T. rex a run for its money, and a pack of them could have taken on an adult T. rex, DePalma says. This deadly capability means the raptor, described online this week in the journal Paleontological Contributions, has scientists rethinking their notions about the ecology of the region. Its like getting all the facts weve ever had about the predator prey relationships in Hell Creek and shaking them all up in a bag, DePalma says. Philip Manning, a paleontologist at the University of Manchester in the U.K. who was not involved in the study, agrees. The presence of this major new predator would have undoubtedly had a huge impact on the dynamics of the Late Cretaceous ecosystem, Manning says in an email. Its discovery shows that we have much still to learn about this period of time that is the last gasp of the age of the dinosaurs. One of the most striking features of the Dakotaraptor fossil is a series of tiny bumps on its forearm, which DePalmas team has identified as quill knobs. Found on many modern birds, these bony nubs serve as fortified attachment sites for long wing feathers. Dakotaraptor is the first large raptor found that has physical evidence of quill knobs, DePalma says. When you see quill knobs, it tells you that the animal was serious about using those feathers. The bone structure of Dakotaraptors arm also bears a striking resemblance to the wing structure of modern birds. We can use the word wing correctly here even though it was too big to fly, DePalma says. But if it wasnt capable of flight, why did Dakotaraptor need wings and quill knobs? These things dont appear overnight, and evolutionarily you dont evolve features like that without a reason, DePalma adds. One intriguing possibility is that Dakotaraptor was part of a lineage of dinosaurs that once had the ability to fly but then lost it. When things become flightless, you generally see them become big, DePalma says. You saw it with moas and terror birds, and you see it with ostriches today. Dakotaraptor could have essentially been a lethal paleo ostrich. However, Manning thinks a more likely possibility is that Dakotaraptor belonged to a group of theropod dinosaurs that was laying the groundwork for flight but had not yet taken that final leap into the skies. In either scenario, the flightless Dakotaraptor could still have found uses for its wing feathers, DePalma says. For example, the animal could have used them to frighten or impress other dinosaurs or to pin down preyboth are strenuous activities that would require strong feather attachments. Alternatively, Dakotaraptor could have used its wings to shield its young. Some hawks will form a kind of tent over their chicks to shield them from the weather or the sun, DePalma says. If you imagine a dozen squirming baby raptors that have the energy and tenacity of kittens knocking into your wings, then that could warrant quill knobs as well."}, {"title": "Tiny Terror: Controversial Dinosaur Species Is Just an Awkward Tween Tyrannosaurus", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "October 28, 2015", "doc": "Tyrannosaurus rex truly is the king of the dinosaurs. Reaching 40 feet in length, weighing in at over nine tons and boasting a bite force of over 12,000 pounds, its no wonder weve celebrated this ancient carnivore since the time its bones were first put on display over a century ago. But the imposing frame of an adult T. rex is only part of the animals story. At the annual Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in Dallas, Texas earlier this month, Carthage College paleontologist Thomas Carr highlighted how dramatically the tyrant changed as it grew upand what this means for the fate of a fossil thats been surrounded by controversy for three decades. Carrs presentation centered on a pair of finds made in eastern Montana, separated by six decades. The first was a small tyrannosaur skull uncovered in 1942 that then rested in the Cleveland Museum of Natural History collections for four decades. The fossil was mostly forgotten until Robert Bakker and his colleagues made a sensational announcement in 1988. According to the team, that fossilnicknamed the Cleveland skullrepresented a totally new genus of small bodied tyrannosaur that prowled the same habitats as the beefier T. rex. Befitting its small stature, they named the tiny terror Nanotyrannus.\n\nNot all paleontologists were sold on the proposal, though, including Carr. In 1999, he proposed that Nanotyrannus was really a juvenile T. rex, simultaneously rejecting Bakkers hypothesis and providing a new look at what the tyrant king was like as an awkward youth. The differences between Nanotyrannus and Tyrannosaurus were signs of how these dinosaurs aged rather than the hallmarks of different species, Carr argued.\n\nThe debate over the proper identity of Nanotyrannus has been stomping on ever since, with Bakker and other supporters insisting that the differences in size, tooth count and other features mark the Cleveland skull as a distinct dinosaur. But now Carr and his coauthors\u00a0have\u00a0completed a comprehensive analysis of a definitive juvenile T. rex, discovered in 2001 and nicknamed Jane by the Burpee Museum of Natural History in Illinois. The new evidence supports the notion that the Nanotyrannus fossils described so far are really the rare remains of young Tyrannosaurus.\n\nAt about 11 years old, Jane was a little bit more mature than the animal represented by the Cleveland skull, but it had not yet developed the classic, deep skulled profile we usually associate with T. rex. According to Carr, Jane was just at the cusp of undergoing a major growth spurt, in which the dinosaur would have dramatically transformed from a lanky teen into an adult with a bone crushing bite. This puts Jane in a transitional stage between younger T. rex, like the Cleveland skull, and the classic form of the adults, Carr says.\n\nWhile Nanotyrannus defenders claim that there are other fossils that bolster their hypothesis, these fossils have not been placed in accredited museums or other public institutions  a standard requirement in paleontology. The owners of a proposed Nanotyrannus fossil found in Montana even tried, and failed, to sell the specimen at public auction, which could have hidden the bones away in a private collection and robbed scientists of the opportunity to study it. More than a dozen other T. rex fossils are already privately held, which puts up a barrier to learning more about the dinosaur. Carr stresses that his conclusions about Jane dont rest on a single fossil. No specimen is an island unto itself, he says, and the lessons learned from Jane hinge upon having a sample of younger and older animals that helped put the fossil in context. Not that all the gaps are filled just yet. There are parts of the T. rex growth series that are still unknown. At the top of Carrs fossil wish list is a T. rex specimen that shows when the skull switched from Janes long, narrow profile to the deep jaws of the adults. With luck, future discoveries will be placed into public museums and provide even more context showing how the great T. rex grew from an awkward teen into an imposing predator."}, {"title": "Where Dinosaurs Walked: Eight of the Best Places to See Prehistoric Footprints", "author": "Robin T.

The reservation is one of several places around the world where you can walk in the footsteps of giants.  Ichnologythe formal study of dinosaur tracksbegan here in 1836 when Amherst College geology professor Edward Hitchcock found tracks from what he thought were gregarious birds in a quarry. He went on to collect almost 2,000 dinosaur tracks, many of which are still on campus in the Beneski Museum of Natural History. The biggest one is 20 inches long and 14 inches widemore than twice the size of a womans hand.  We dont know what kind of dinosaur made the print because we dont have the bones, Alfred J. Venne, the museums educator, tells Smithsonian.com. So we look for similar tracks and for ones that would have been close to where we are now. So far, dilophosaurus, coelophysis, and similar tracks found in England are the strongest contenders.  The tracks have more to tell, says Venne For example, they can show a dinosaurs speed. The stride is longer if the animal is going faster, Venne notes, adding that scientists have compared the tracks to those of birds dinosaurs closest living relatives.  About 10 miles west of Amherst, quarry owner Kornell Nash continues to unearth dinosaur footprints on the property his father, Carlton, bought in 1939. After cutting out a slice of shale, he separates it with a simple kitchen knife to reveal two prints. One half, he explains, is negative, where the dinosaurs foot sank into the mud. It served as a mold for a positive print made of layers of dirt that piled up over time. Examples of both are on display and for sale in Nashs museum near the quarry.

Today, the tracks weave across a 300 foot high limestone wall thats one of the star attractions of the\u00a0Cretaceous Museum.

The sauropod dinosaursthe biggest creatures to ever walk the Earthrequired rapid growth rates, skeletons that were both light and strong and copious amounts of food, just for starters. Now, paleontologists may have cracked one of the remaining mysteries about these giant dinosaurs How did they pump enough blood up their long necks to feed their brains? University of Southern California paleontologist Michael Habib was inspired to investigate sauropod necks after seeing bones from a giant titanosaur found in the New Mexico desert. The well preserved\u00a0neck bones included spines called cervical ribs that stretch\u00a0almost six feet long. These rods, Habib says, turned out to be made of a very flexible sort of bone that made pretty darn good springs.\n\nAs the giant dinosaurs walked, the motion would have created an inertial problem for the sauropods. Without something to dampen this effect, Habib says, the neck is going to start to sway back and forth like a badly mounted crane or tree in a breeze. This is where the cervical ribs came in. These springy bones dampened that effect, allowing the dinosaurs to keep their necks relatively steady as they plodded along, Habib told researchers gathered last week at the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting in Dallas, Texas.\n\nBut Habib found that the dinosaurs special anatomical arrangement had a peculiar side effect. From a combination of fossil and modern animal anatomy, paleontologists know which muscles must have surrounded the cervical ribs and the other nearby soft tissues. In sauropods, as the cervical ribs flexed, they would have compressed towards the neck, and the muscle would have pushed on air sacs wrapped around the vertebral artery. In effect, the motion acts as an accessory pump to the heart, says Habib. Paleontologists have been debating for decades how sauropods could have generated enough blood pressure to pump the vital fluid from the heart to the brain.\u00a0 Sauropod necks are contentious for the same reason as other parts of dinosaur anatomy are contentiousits an extreme trait, Habib says. Researchers have proposed two ton hearts, special siphon systems and even a string of little pseudo hearts to overcome the problem, but all these ideas suffered from the fact that the relevant soft tissues were never preserved.\n\nAccording to Habibs hypothesis, the answer has been staring us in the face all along. And the solution would have worked with relatively little effort. Blood pumping would get a boost any time the dinosaurs moved their necks, Habib says, and the effect only gets stronger in dinosaurs with extraordinarily long necks. As you make the neck longer, you get more skeletal muscle and get more pump, Habib says, meaning that extreme sauropods like Mamenchisaurus, which had a neck that stretched nearly 40 feet, would have had plenty of extra power to keep their blood pumping.\n\nIf even one to three percent of the necks muscle power helped blood flow, the effect would have reduced the required mass of the heart by over 25 percent, Habib notes. So the neck doing even a little work would have been a great relief to the heart. In this case, sauropods didnt require special, unseen organs to keep their blood pumping. Instead, the arrangement of muscles, blood vessels and air sacs, Habib says, meant\u00a0that the neck pays for itself."}, {"title": "Can Eggshells Crack the Case of Whether Dinosaurs Ran Hot or Cold?", "author": "Marissa Fessenden", "date": "October 15, 2015", "doc": "One of the hottest debates surrounding the dinosaurs is temperature Were these\u00a0terrible lizards who stalked, tromped and flew around the ancient world\u200b\u00a0warm or cold blooded?\u00a0A new study\u00a0of dinosaur\u00a0eggshells\u200b\u00a0supports\u00a0a third optionboth.\u00a0 Since eggs grow their tough calcium carbonate shells inside their mothers body, looking at the chemical structures of those eggs can give scientists clues about the critters temperature, according to the study recently published in the\u00a0journal\u00a0Nature Communications.\u00a0 Researchers\u00a0analyzed\u00a0eggshells\u00a0from\u00a0two\u00a0groups\u00a0of\u00a0Cretaceous\u00a0dinosaurs.\u00a0One set of eggs belong\u00a0to the behemoth titanosaursa group of long necked herbivores that included the familiar Brontosaurus.\u00a0The other eggs belong to the\u00a0bipedal, omnivorous\u00a0oviraptorid, which are smaller\u00a0and more bird like.\u00a0 Scientists can estimate the body temperature\u00a0by looking for bonds between rare isotopes of carbon and oxygen\u00a0carbon 13 and oxygen 18\u00a0in the calcium carbonate minerals that make up eggshells,\u00a0Rachel\u00a0Feltman\u00a0reports\u00a0for\u00a0The Washington Post\u200b. More of those bonds\u00a0means the eggshell formed at a cooler temperature in the mothers body.\u00a0 This egg analysis suggested that tintanosaurs\u00a0ran at a hot\u00a099.7 degrees Fahrenheit, while the oviraptorid chilled at a cooler 89.4 degrees. But to tell if they were cold blooded or warm blooded scientist also needed to know the temperature of their environment. The terms cold blooded and warm blooded are actually misnomers and are more properly termed\u00a0ectotherms\u00a0and\u00a0endotherms. Like lizards warming in the sun,\u00a0ectotherms\u00a0need external\u00a0heat sources to regulate their body temperatures, while\u00a0endotherms\u00a0generate their own heat through metabolism, explains\u00a0a press release\u00a0from the National Science Foundation.\u00a0 So to tell where the animals got their heat\u00a0scientists examined fossilized soils that surrounded the eggs in present day Mongolia and Argentina, which showed ancient temperatures of roughly\u00a079 degrees Farenheit.\u00a0Both dinosaurs were warmer than that, which could mean\u00a0possible endothermy, but since the temperatures are so different, the researchers think a middle of the road approach was likely. This suggests that maybe they were warm blooded, but hadnt developed the high level of temperature regulation seen in mammals and birds today, lead study author Robert Eagle, of the University of California, Los Angeles, tells The Post. They were kind of part way to evolving endothermy. That puts dinosaurs in class with the catchy moniker\u00a0mesotherms. Animals that subscribe to this strategy can generate and regulate their own body heat but dont maintain as constant a temperature as mammals do. Modern animals including tuna, lamnid sharks and leatherback turtles are mesotherms, reports Alexandra Witze for Nature.\u00a0 Modern birds do fall squarely in the endotherm territory, with fast metabolisms and warm body temperatures to match. Since birds are the descendants of creatures like the oviraptoid,\u00a0the researchers think their method might help track the evolution of endothermy in dinosaur lineages.\u00a0 As far as the dinosaur temperature debate goes, the results sound like a good compromise."}, {"title": "How the Giraffe Got Its Long Neck: It Happened in Spurts", "author": "Danny Lewis", "date": "October 9, 2015", "doc": "How the giraffe got its neck is a question people have asked for centuries, both in science labs and ancient myths.

A group of paleontologists with the University of Queensland were shocked while on a recent dig in Central Queensland, when they discovered fossil fragments from a giant lizard just a few meters below the surface of the earth. When the fossils were finally dated, they realized that the lizard lived about 50,000 years ago  the same time as the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians first arrived on the continent. Our jaws dropped when we found a tiny fossil from a giant lizard during a two metre deep excavation in one of the Capricorn Caves, near Rockhampton, vertebrate paleoecologist Gilbert Price said in a statement. The one centimetre bone, an osteoderm, came from under the lizards skin and is the youngest record of a giant lizard on the entire continent. According to a new study of the fossil fragments, its unclear whether the bone shards belonged to a Komodo dragon, which once roamed Australia, or the extinct Megalania monitor lizard, which could grow up to almost 20 feet long and weighed around 1,100 pounds. Whichever giant lizard the bone fragment belonged to, it was an apex predator of some sort that might have existed alongside the early Aborigines, Conor Gaffey writes for Newsweek. Back during the Pleistocene epoch, which the lizard fossil dates back to, Australia was home to a number of enormous animals roaming the outback wombats as big as rhinos, massive snakes and seven foot tall kangaroos are just some of the animals whose remains paleontologists have discovered in caves across the continent, Joel Achenbach wrote for National Geographic in 2010. But while researchers have long known that humans existed alongside these giant animals, this is the first evidence of a giant lizard living during the same era. Its been long debated whether or not humans or climate change knocked off the giant lizards, alongside the rest of the megafauna, Price said in a statement. Humans can only now be considered as potential drivers of their extinction. While many scientists believe that most species of Australian megafauna were wiped out during the last Ice Age about 12,000 years ago, some have argued that their extinction was due in part to humans. While it appears that the giant lizards in question died off long before the Ice Age occurred, the fact that it shared the outback with the Aborigines ancestors could suggest that they might have been some of the first megafauna to succumb to humanitys spread across the planet."}, {"title": "New Fossil Discovery May Change What We Know About Human Evolution", "author": "Danny Lewis", "date": "September 10, 2015", "doc": "On October 7, 2013, paleoanthropologist Lee Berger posted\u00a0a job ad on Facebook\u00a0looking for fellow scientists with a very particular set of skills they had to have caving experience, be small enough to fit through an opening barely seven inches wide and be able to leave immediately for South Africa.

While it appears that\u00a0Homo naledis\u00a0brains were too small to handle navigating through a pitch black cavern, Berger believes that the skeletons were intentionally placed in the cave in a burial ritual,\u00a0Yong writes. We found nothing else, and the only time you ever find just one thing is when humans deliberately do it, Berger\u00a0tells Yong. I dont see any other conclusion. According to Berger, the cave has no flowing water, and its doubtful another type of animal could have dragged the bodies through the narrow space. Plus there are no signs the bones have been scavanged by predators.\u00a0 While researchers still have much more to learn from the fossils, including precisely how old they are, in the meantime paleontologists can welcome a new member to humanitys family tree."}, {"title": "In Some Ways, Human Hands Are More Primitive Than Chimp Hands", "author": "Helen Thompson", "date": "July 17, 2015", "doc": "Humans like to think theyre pretty dexterous with their\u00a0sleek thumbs and strong grips. However, in some respects, our hands might actually be more primitive than those of our closest Great Ape relatives, chimpanzees.

Scientists have long thought that when humans and chimps diverged seven\u00a0million years ago, natural selection shaped chimp and human hands differently, explains\u00a0Michael Balter for\u00a0Science. While chimpanzees grew longer fingers and slightly shorter thumbs, well adapted to their tree climbing lifestyles, humans developed smaller fingers and slightly longer thumbsideal for precisely gripping things like tools.\u00a0  But now, a\u00a0growing body of evidence is starting to suggest that only one piece of that logic is sound, writes Balter. Chimpanzee hands certainly did evolve. But human hands have stayed quite similar for millions of years, tool use or not.\u00a0Some early hominins\u00a0that didnt make tools and still appear to have hands that are more like those of modern humans.

According to a recent study, some punctures on Neanderthal fossils are likely bite marks from large carnivore attacks. Scientists\u00a0know what the average Neanderthal ate, how they hunted, who they mated with, how they divvied up chores and to some degree where they crossed paths with large carnivores. Evidence from archaeological and paleontological sites indicates that Neanderthals scavenged the leftovers of big carnivores, hunted them and even competed with them for cave shelters. Recently, a\u00a0team of Spanish researchers used modern cases of carnivore attacks on humans to see if bite marks on Neanderthal bones bore similarities. Looking at 124 recent case of attacks by lions, tigers, bears, leopards and other carnivores on modern humans, they found similarities to marked bones in the fossil record during the Pleistocene between 40,000 and 200,000 years ago. The group posits that bite marks\u00a0could have been the result of a carnivore attack. However, its unclear how often these attacks might have occurred. In one case, they pinpointed the carnivorous perpetrator. Puncture marks in the skull of a young Neanderthal child unearthed in a cave in Valencia, Spain, resemble those from modern big cat attacks. Their results appear in this months issue of Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences. Understanding how Neanderthals interacted with big cats and other contemporary predators could perhaps inform how we share our own environment with large wildlife. The conflict between humans and large carnivores has been present and constant throughout human evolution, enduring even to modern times, the researchers write. Though modern humans outcompeted Neanderthals for resources, its possible that carnivore threats exacerbated their demise, they argue. Given that Neanderthals lived amid these predators, perhaps its not too surprising that some of the hominids met their end at the jaws of a ferocious animal."}, {"title": "Scientists Clash Over Stegosaurus Sexing", "author": "Erin Blakemore", "date": "April 23, 2015", "doc": "Its a claim\u00a0that could change the way we think about dinosaurs. But a new paper\u00a0that argues\u00a0scientists could\u00a0tell the difference between male and female Stegosaurus by the shape of their plates is coming under fire from paleontologists. Behind the controversy is a student named Evan Saitta. While attending high school, he took a trip to Montanas Judith River Dinosaur Institute, where he became fascinated by the prehistoric creatures platesthe characteristic bony bits that rise up along the spine of\u00a0the Stegosauruss back. He tells LiveSciences Laura Geggel that the quarry where the fossils were found contains remains of multiple different Stegosaurus from the same time period, which sparked his interest in comparing the different animals armor. With the help of CT scans and measurements, Saitta began to study the fossils and compare his results to plates and replicas\u00a0contained in other collections. In his study, he identified two distinct forms of plate tall and wide. Wide plates had surface areas of up to 45 percent higher than their tall counterparts. Saitta then ruled out the possibility that the different dinosaurs were different species, or perhaps still growing. Once he was convinced that neither of those things could explain the differences, Saitta floated an intriguing idea What if plates were instead evidence of sexual dimorphism, or difference between sexes? As males typically invest more in their ornamentation, the larger, wide plates likely came from males, said Saitta. These broad plates would have provided a great display surface to attract mates. The tall plates might have functioned as prickly predator deterrents in females. But response to the paper has been decidedly frigid within the field. Natures Angus Chen reports that paleontologists like UC Berkeleys Kevin Padian claim Saitta misidentified features in bone tissue that he used to rule out growth as a factor in plate size. And others have challenged Saittas use of reproduction plates and privately held bones into question, citing ethical issues that prevent other paleontologists from using specimens that are not in the public trust. These ethical considerations are common for paleontologists, who are ethically bound to use publicly available and legally obtained specimens in order to conduct reproducible research. As for Saitta, he stands by his work. I want people to focus on the science, he told Chen. And Michael Benton, director of the paleobiology program where Saitta is currently a student, is proud of Saittas accomplishment.

The Dinosaur Might Deserve Its Own Genus After All", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "April 7, 2015", "doc": "It may be one of the most famous dinosaurs of all time. The trouble is that shortly after being discovered, the Jurassic creature fell into an identity crisis. The name for the long necked, heavy bodied herbivore Brontosaurus excelsusthe great thunder lizardwas tossed into the scientific wastebasket when it was discovered that the dinosaur wasnt different enough from other specimens to deserve its own distinct genus. But now, in a paleontological twist, Brontosaurus just might be back. A new analysis of dinosaur skeletons across multiple related species suggests that the original thunder lizard is actually unique enough to resurrect the beloved moniker, according to researchers in the U.K. and Portugal. We didnt expect this at all at the beginning, says study co author Emmanuel Tschopp of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa. At first, Tschopp had been working only with Oct\u00e1vio Mateus of the Museu da Lourinh\u00e3 to update the family tree of diplodocid dinosaurs. But when it started looking like Brontosaurus might be real after all, they asked Roger Benson at the University of Oxford to join their team and run a statistical analysis on their findings. Rogers calculations gave the same results, Tschopp says. Brontosaurus should be valid. The name Brontosaurus excelsus was coined by Yale paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, who described the species in an 1879 paper with the mundane title Notice of New Jurassic Reptiles. His description is based on an enormous partial skeleton exhumed from the 150 million year old rock of Como Bluff, Wyoming. This monster of a dinosaur added to Marshs rapidly growing fossil collection, which already included similar species. Just two years earlier, Marsh had named Apatosaurus ajaxthe deceptive lizardfrom a partial skeleton found in the Jurassic rock of Colorado.\n\nBrontosaurus quickly gained fame because it was among the first dinosaurs the public encountered. An illustration of its skeleton was the first dinosaur restoration to get a wide circulation, points out North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences historian Paul Brinkman. This helped spread the popularity of Brontosaurus in an era before dinosaurs proliferated widely in natural history museums. And once museums started to put up skeletons of Brontosaurusthe first was assembled in New York City in 1905the dinosaurs popularity only grew. But as anyone who has strolled through an up to date museum hall knows, the name Brontosaurus was eventually abandoned. In 1903, paleontologist Elmer Riggs found that most of the traits that seemed to distinguish Marshs two specimens had to do with differences in growth, and it was more likely that the skeletons belonged to the same genus. Since it was named first, Apatosaurus had priority over Brontosaurus. Despite the extreme similarity between Marshs skeletons, Riggs recognized that they differed just enough to be regarded as different species. Therefore Apatosaurus ajax would remain in place, and Brontosaurus was changed to Apatosaurus excelsus. It took a while for museums to follow suit, but by the 1970s everyone finally got on board with the shift. Bringing Brontosaurus back from scientific obsolescence would be the equivalent of restoring Pluto to the status of planet. And much like the drawn out debate over the extraterrestrial body, the status of Brontosaurus relies on definitions and the philosophy of how scientists go about making divisions in a messy natural world. To navigate the ever growing number of dinosaur species, paleontologists look to a discipline called cladistics. In short, scientists pore over dinosaur skeletons to score a set of subtle characteristics, such as the way a flange of bone is oriented. Computer programs sort through those traits to create a family tree based upon who shares which characteristics. However, different researchers might pick different characteristics and score them in different ways, so any single result is a hypothesis that requires verification from other researchers independently generating the same results. Heres where Brontosaurus stomps in. Tschopp and colleagues had set out to create a revised family tree of diplodocid dinosaurshuge sauropods found from the western United States to Portugalwith a special emphasis on sorting out how many species of Diplodocus and Apatosaurus there were. The researchers scored 477 anatomical landmarks across 81 individual dinosaurs. While the general shape of the tree supported what other paleontologists had previously proposed, there was a surprise in store The bones Marsh originally called Brontosaurus seem to stand apart from the two Apatosaurus species, the team reports today in PeerJ. Most of the differences the researchers identified were subtle anatomical features, but there are some broader traits, Tschopp says. The most obvious and visual feature would be that Apatosaurus has a wider neck than Brontosaurus, he says, adding that despite the title thunder lizard, Brontosaurus was not quite as robust as Apatosaurus. These results came from two Brontosaurus skeletons the one Marsh used to coin the name, and a second that could confidently be referred to as the same species. There are more possible Brontosaurus bones out there, and Tschopp studied many of them in preparation for the current study. But because the skeletons were incomplete, the bones popped up in various positions on the family tree. Now, with the new diplodocid tree in hand, Tschopp says he plans to take a second look at these bones to see whether they truly group with Brontosaurus or something else. \u00a0 What remains unclear is whether Brontosaurus is here to stay. Southern Methodist University paleontologist Louis Jacobs praises the new study. Numerous new sauropods have been discovered and named in the last couple of decades, new techniques have been developed, and we simply have a more sophisticated understanding of sauropods now, he says. The potential resurrection comes out of this burgeoning understanding. In short, Jacobs says, good for them, and bully for Brontosaurus John Whitlock of Mount Aloysius College is more reserved. For me the issue is how you want to define genera and species in dinosaur paleontology, Whitlock says. Some researchers will look at this study and conclude that Brontosaurus should still be an Apatosaurus because of their close relationship, forming what paleontologists call a monophyletic group, while others will emphasize the diversity. Theres no standard rule for how such decisions should be made. I think we are going to start seeing discussion about not only how much change is enough to split a monophyletic group but, more importantly, how do we compare characters and character states? Whitlock says. Thats going to be a fun debate to be a part of, and Im excited about it. The fate of Brontosaurus now relies upon whether other paleontologists will be able to replicate the results, as well as what those researchers think about the threshold for when dinosaurs merit different names. Other dinosaurs are held in the same taxonomic tension. While some researchers recognize the slender tyrannosaur Gorgosaurus libratus as a unique genus, for example, others see it as a species of Albertosaurus. But the battle for Brontosaurus stands apart. The name has become a totem of the extinct creatures that continue to ignite our imaginations with scenes of Jurassic titans ambling over fern carpeted floodplains. Weve kept the name Brontosaurus alive because the hefty herbivore is an emissary to a past we can never visit, but that we can still connect to through the dinosaurs magnificent bones. Protocol will ultimately dictate the dinosaurs title, but in spirit if not in science, those old bones will always be Brontosaurus.

It weighed more than 12 pounds. I couldnt believe my eyes, Xiao Pan told the Mirror. But the creaturea\u00a0Chinese giant salamander\u00a0would have been a cute little thing to Metoposaurus algarvensis, an amphibian that roamed the earth more than 200 million years ago. Its basically a salamander thats the size of a car, Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh, who is excavating a trove of these creatures from a site in southern Portugal, reports BBC News. Its one of those creatures from the distant past that looks like an alien   but it actually has quite a lot of relevance, he says. These kind of big amphibians were the ancestral stock that modern frogs, salamanders and newts came from. Metoposaurus algarvensis had large flat heads lined with hundreds of sharp teeth, according to a press release. Brusatte and the team have excavated around 13 square feet of the site so far and have uncovered bones from at least 10 individuals. Their findings are described in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. The giant creatures would have made lakes and rivers somewhat terrifying for early dinosaurs in the Triassic.\u00a0 Similar animals have been found before, though these specimens are the first in the Iberian peninsula, says Susan Evans, a professor of paleontology at the University College London, according to BBC News.

Theyve been found in Germany, Poland, Africa, Indonesia and North America.  Fortunately, for the dinosaurs anyway, the\u00a0Guardian reports that the amphibians dominance would have been limited\u00a0  Though a top predator in its own right, Metoposaurus had small, weak limbs for such a large animal. The relative puniness of its legs meant it could not venture far onto land, and so could easily be stranded if its watery home dried out.

It\u00a0looked like a bizarre cross between a giant squid and a clawless lobster. But this seven foot behemoth was likely an evolutionary trendsetterone of the earliest and biggest arthropods ever to exist and responsible for its phylums descendants, animals like spiders, butterflies, crabs\u00a0and centipedes.  Despite its size and somewhat fearsome appearance, it was a gentle filter feeder, feasting on plankton and other small sea animals using a comb like appendage to scoop up the tiny creatures, the way whales do now, NPR reports. And, as it did when it was alive, the creature is again making waves.  A highly\u00a0defined anomalocaridids\u00a0fossil was recently discovered in Moroccos portion of the Sahara Dessert and described in a paper published by the journal Nature. Unlike previously evaluated fossils from the animal, the new find is in excellent shaperather than being squashed flat, its features are raised, giving the scientists who carefully excavated its detail from surrounding rock a 3D view of its anatomy.\u00a0 According to Jenny Marder at PBS Newshour, the specimens featuresand their implicationsstartled Yale paleontologist Peter Van Roy, lead author of the\u00a0Nature paper. Scientists were already aware that anomalocaridids had appendages used to grab prey or filter plankton from the water and flaps on the sides of their long trunks that were used for swimming. But they were thought to only have a single set of flaps and no legs whatsoever. But what Van Roy saw were two sets of flaps. Writes Marder This discovery of two flaps solved the riddle of the supposedly lost legs in anomalocaridids. For without them, how had modern legs of arthropods evolved? The lower set of flaps seem to be modified legs, Van Roy said, used in the case of these animals for swimming. These flaps, Van Roy and his team believe, are the precursors to walking legs while the upper flaps gave rise to gills found in modern anthropods. When Van Roy and his team went back to look at other specimens of the creature, they saw evidence of the two flaps that had been previously overlooked. Some experts are now saying that the new information on the specimen, a version of the animal the scientists called Aegirocassis benmoulae, helps to close up a substantial gap in our understanding of arthropod evolution.  But what made this man sized, swimming centipede, as NPR called it, so big? Van Roy say that has to do with the era in which it evolveda time during the Ordovician geological period referred to as the\u00a0Great Ordovician Biological Diversification Event that marked the biggest diversification in marine animal life that weve ever known, according to Van Roy. A lot of the new life on earth was plankton, which gave anomalocaridids a good reason to evolve into a filter eater. Scientists theorize that the animal grew huge throughout this period to make it less of an easy object of prey.  If youre filter feeding, of course, you probably are not going to be able to defend yourself, Van Roy said according to NPR. Youre not going to have, like, big fangs or anything. So, one way of escaping from predation is just by growing so massive that theres ... simply nothing else that can tackle you."}, {"title": "Vinegar-Like Acid Rain May Have Fallen During Earth\u2019s Worst Extinction", "author": "Devin Powell", "date": "January 21, 2015", "doc": "Roughly a quarter of a billion years ago, an apocalypse struck the Earth. Known as the Great Dying, it claimed more lives than any other mass extinction known to science, including the one that did in the non avian dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Over 90 percent of all species on the planet were wiped out, from armor clad trilobites in the oceans to giant reptiles on land. The host of strange creatures vanished, giving way to the ancestors of modern flora and fauna.  What caused the cataclysm has long been a subject of debatetheories range from an asteroid impact to methane belching microbes. The most popular scenario starts with volcanoes in present day Siberia, which erupted at about the right time to have kicked off a cascade of problems, including climate change. Now a team of researchers has found physical evidence that extremely caustic acid rain created by these massive eruptions could have played a part in the loss of life.  For the first time, we can say that soils from this time had an acidity similar to that of vinegar, says Mark Sephton, a geologist at Imperial College London whose team will publish the finding in February in the journal Geology.  Sephton and his colleagues examined traces of ancient soils in rock strata that date back to the extinction, which occurred at the end of the Permian period around 250 million years ago. At this time, all of the worlds landmasses were fused into the supercontinent Pangaea. The rocks, unearthed in what is now Northern Italy, contained a particularly intriguing substance vanillin, the same molecule that gives vanilla its flavor and aroma. Vanillin is naturally produced by plants and is found in wood. But it shouldnt survive long on its own in the ground, where bacteria release enzymes that break it down. Finding significant amounts preserved for hundreds of millions of years was even more surprising.  Its certainly unusual, says Tim Bugg, a biological chemist at the University of Warwick who was not involved in the study. To see vanillin accumulate probably suggests a lack of bacterial degradation activity.  To explain the lethargy of the bacteria, the researchers turned to the dairy industry for inspiration. Milk producers often flavor their beverages by adding a dash of vanilla. Experiments have shown that acidifying milk protects the additive and prolongs the flavor, because the low pH deactivates the enzymes that would otherwise target vanillin.  Soil bacteria activity out in the wild could be similarly sensitive to acid, which would also explain why the Italian rocks contained relatively low amounts of a chemical called vanillic acid that tends to be produced by vanillin munching bacteria. Our data fits the idea that acid rain caused the microbes to cease functioning, says Henk Visscher, a paleoecologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands and a member of Sephtons team.  Studies of acid rain produced in the 20th century, primarily by fossil fuel burning power plants, have shown that it can disrupt ecosystems. The poisonous precipitation strips nutrients out of the soil and damages plants.\u00a0A loss of vegetation could have lead to widespread erosion, Septhon speculates, and a shortage of food that made life difficult for creatures higher on the food chain. The finding is welcome news for Benjamin Black, now a geologist at the University of California, Berkeley. While at MIT he helped create a computer simulation that estimated the amount and severity of acid rain that could have been produced by the Siberian eruptions. My hope when I was making that prediction was that we would find ways to test it, says Black.  Published in 2013, the model suggested that carbon dioxide belched out by the eruptions could have lowered the pH of rain to about 4, the acidity of\u00a0tomato juice. Add in sulfur dioxide, another common volcanic emission, and the acidity could have worsened a hundred foldthe Northern Hemisphere could have been scoured by bursts of rain as acidic as undiluted lemon juice.  It cant be a coincidence that vanillin turns up exactly at this time, says Greg Retallack, a paleobotanist at the University of Oregon who was not involved in the research. But he cautions that this new and unfamiliar approach to studying ancient soils must be carefully scrutinized. Retallack also questions whether sulfur dioxide emissions from the Siberian volcanoes could have had such a global impact. The pollutant typically forms heavy aerosol particles that rain out of the sky, limiting how far it can travel.  The severe acid rain proposed by Sephtons team could instead have been the work of a smaller eruption close to the site studied, suggests Retallack. Another possibility is that, in certain conditions, microbes can produce sulfuric acid and acidify their environments all by themselves. In either case, the plunge in soil pH would have been limited to the region.  Bolstering the case for a worldwide acid rain epidemic may require looking farther afield. Traces of ancient soils dating back to the Great Dying have turned up not only in Italy but also in places such as China and Greenland. Future studies could test whether these rocks also contain a hint of vanilla."}, {"title": "Zigzags on a Shell From Java Are the Oldest Human Engravings", "author": "Helen Thompson", "date": "December 3, 2014", "doc": "On the banks of the Solo River in Java, Indonesia, 19th century physician Eugene Dubois uncovered an astounding fossil find the bones of what appeared to be an ancient human, surrounded by animal remains and shells. Excavated in the 1890s, the site gained fame as the home of Java Man, better known today as Homo erectus.  Dated to between a million and 700,000 years old, the bones immediately provoked controversy, because Dubois claimed they showed evidence of a transitional species between apes and humans. It turns out he was rightHomo erectus fossils have since been found in Africa and elsewhere in Asia, and it is possible the species is a direct ancestor of our own. But its the palm sized shells found alongside the Java remains that are raising big questions today. An examination of the shells published in Nature suggests that Homo erectus may have used the shells for tools and decorated some of them with geometric engravings. At around half a million years old, the shells represent the earliest evidence of such decorative marks and also the first known use of shells to make tools.  Dubois collected 11 species of freshwater shells at the site, called Trinil. Most of them belong to the sub species Pseudodon vondembuschianus trinilensis, a now extinct freshwater mussel he described in 1908. Initially scientists thought the mollusks had naturally clustered at the site, perhaps driven by water currents. Even without a connection to the human fossil, the cache provided a nice census of ancient freshwater shell life, coming from at least 166 Pseudodon individuals.  Thats what first attracted Josephine Joordens, a marine biologist and archaeologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands. A few years ago, Stephen Munro, an archaeologist at Australian National University and a study co author, happened to briefly look through the Dubois shell collection and took a few photos. The images showed markings on the shells, at first invisible to the naked eye.\u00a0Its strange to see a zigzag pattern on such old fossil shells, recalls Joordens.   Intrigued, the researchers compared the Dubois shells to how living mollusks were arranged and buried in the wild. The patterns didnt match up. Most of the shells also had weird holes corresponding to the where the organisms adductor muscle and ligament, used to open and close the shell, would have been attached. Presumably, someone or something was trying to pry open the shell and remove the gooey mussel. Back then, shellfish eaters such as otters, rats and\u00a0monkeys also lived on Java. Figuring out what could have poked holes in the shells required some experimentation.  With no modern specimen to draw from, the team selected a living mollusk with the closest characteristics to the ancient Pseudodons, a freshwater mussel called Potamida littoralis. The group tried to open the shells with the most likely pointy object at hand on Java, a shark tooth. Only piercing the muscle popped the shells open without breaking them. That requires a certain degree of dexterity and knowhow, so Homo erectus became the most likely culprit.   The opening of shellfish by piercing the valve is unusual, and is not seen in either early Homo sapiens or Neanderthal middens, which are essentially shellfish trash dumps, says Kat Szabo, an archaeologist at the University of Wollongong. If humans on Java were opening the shells for food, the method suggests they ate the shellfish raw. As bivalves open easily after cooking, this does suggest that the mollusks at Trinil werent cooked, says Szabo.  There is another possible reason Homo erectus might have been scraping out mollusk shells. One specimen had been modified and was likely used as a tool. Under a microscope, the shell was visibly sharpened, with hallmark striations from contact with hard material. The shell tool has a knife like edge, so we assume that it was used for cutting andor scraping, says Joordens.   Exactly what the shell was used for is impossible to know. A previous study suggested that cut marks on ancient cow bones found on Java likely came from shell tools, which could have been used to butcher animals, cut plants or clean fish. Neanderthals, which lived about 200,000 to\u00a040,000 years ago,\u00a0also used shells as tools, though theres evidence that they broke the shells and then sharpened them, notes Enza Spinapolice, an archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.  The presence of a shell tool might explain the dearth of stone tools at hominin sites across Indonesia. This has always been a puzzle, says Joordens. How would they butcher animals without stone tools? It makes sense that the Java humans would simply use what they had at their disposal, but without further evidence of shell tools, its hard to be 100 percent sure. These carvings go deep into the calcium carbonate shell, which is why evidence of the pattern survived over the centuries. But its possible other shells bore more superficial engravings. When fresh, the white shell would have been covered by a leathery brown outer layer, and a carved pattern on such a dark canvas probably looked striking in its day.  Perhaps even more intriguing is a single shell with what appears to be a geometric patternzigzagged grooves carved into the center of the outer shell. Analysis points to the patterns being carved on purpose. Again the team turned to modern mussels they tried carving similar patterns into Potamida littoralis with a shark tooth and compared that to weathering and natural abrasions. Sure enough, their carvings were the closest matches to the ancient pattern.   That must have been an appealing thing for Homo erectus, says Joordens. You can imagine sitting there with a shell in one hand and a tool in the other hand and maybe ready to open the shell for food, but then making a scratch and seeing this white line appear.  The researchers used two dating techniques on preserved sediment in the shells to estimate their age between 540,000 and 430,000 years old. The team also used x rays to examine the Homo erectus bones and confirm that they came from the same rock layer as the shells. The results suggest that the Homo erectus fossils on Java arent quite as old as we thought they were. Still, the geometric engraving predates other examples by around 300,000 years, and the oldest Neanderthal shell tools are also much younger about 110,000 years old.  Creation of geometric patterns could represent a higher level of creativity in Homo erectus than previously thought, or maybe such patterns arent the artistic masterpieces we suppose them to be. This forces us to reassess not only the capacities of Homo erectus, but the criteria we use to gauge the behavioral evolution of our own species, says Szabo.  Given that other Homo erectus populations used stone technology around the same time, the tools and scratches arent totally inconsistent with hominin abilities, notes Rick Potts, a paleoanthropologist with the Smithsonians Human Origins Program. Homo erectus continued to live on Java until around 200,000 yeas ago, and for Potts, the possibility that these practices persisted as part of Homo erectus culture is even more interesting. That would mean that this incipient capacity to impose a creative pattern on an object was a characteristic of the later members of this species, says Potts Thats really cool."}, {"title": "Reexamining Fossils Revealed a New Dinosaur Species", "author": "Colin Schultz", "date": "November 26, 2014", "doc": "Discovering a new dinosaur usually takes years, if not decades, of painstaking field work.\u00a0But sometimes all it takes is a keen eye.\u00a0Thats how University of Bath palaeontologist Nick Longrich\u00a0found\u00a0two suspected new dinosaur speciesthey were\u00a0hiding amongst the fossils housed at the Canadian Museum of Nature\u00a0in Ottawa.

Each new find, then, suggests an even greater abundance of dinosaur diversity than previously imagined.  We thought we had discovered most of the species, but it seems there are many undiscovered dinosaurs left, said Longrich in a release issued by the University of Bath.

The locals found the remains and delivered them to the Academy of Sciences in Yakutia, who realized this mummified bison was remarkably well preserved, reports The Siberian Times. Now, the first results from the necropsy\u00a0are in, the researchers announced at the Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.  The bison is a steppe bison, a species that lived during the early Holocene epoch, or 9,000 to 12,000 years ago. The mummy is in such good condition that the brain appears to be complete, though shrunken. Other organs, including the heart, blood vessels and stomach look to be close to their normal size, writes the Daily Mail. The find is a rare opportunity, explains Olga Potopova of the Mammoth Site of Hot Springs in South Dakota  It is one out of three relatively complete steppe bison mummies that exist in the world, and it is the most complete out of those three. The body is in excellent condition. Normally, we find the mummies that are significantly damaged by predators in the past, or by modern arctic foxes and others, as soon as mummies are thawed out from the permafrost. Such processes happen very quickly, and a mummy that thaws out during summer may be gone in a few months forever.\u00a0   Very few complete steppe bison have ever surfaced. This Siberian bison joins a much older steppe bison skeleton, nicknamed Bison Bob, that was discovered in 2013\u00a0and the remarkably well mummified Alaska steppe bison a different but related species named Blue Babe. However, records of animals from the Siberian specimens era, known as the Pleistocene Holocene boundary, are rare, Potopova says. \u00a0  The exclusively good preservation of the Yukagir bison mummy allows direct anatomical comparisons with modern species of Bison and cattle, as well as with extinct species of bison that were gone at the Pleistocene Holocene boundary, Evgeny Maschenko, a scientist from the Paleontological Institute in Moscow working on the project, says in a press release.\u00a0  Further study of the bisons parasites and stomach contents could give the researchers a more complete picture of life in the Holocene. Theyve noted so far that this animal had very little fat and may have died of starvation. He was about 4 years old. But more clues could led them to possible causes for the whole species extinction."}, {"title": "This Fifth Grader Found a 14,000-Year-Old Clovis Point, Likely Unearthed From Hurricane Sandy", "author": "Max Kutner", "date": "November 4, 2014", "doc": "Noah Cordle and his family were vacationing on Long Beach Island in New Jersey last summer when a discovery cut his boogie boarding session short. Something pointy brushed against his leg. It didnt feel like any of the other shells, he says. He reached into the water and pulled out an object. Without his glasses on, he thought it looked like an arrowhead or a giant shark tooth. It was about the length of his palm and the color of charcoal. His family contacted the New Jersey State Museum and learned that it was likely a hunting tool used by early Americans thousands of years ago. Any doubts they had turned to excitement. I thought it was a waste of time, Brian Cordle, Noahs father, says was his initial reaction. I was a nonbeliever, but they converted me.  Yesterday, Noah, who is 10 years old and lives in Fairfax, Virginia, visited the National Museum of Natural History to meet with archaeologists and donate his finding, which experts say is a Clovis point. The museum has several hundred in its collection  one of which was discovered as far back as the 1870s  but Noahs is the first one to join the collection from New Jersey. You can lay out Clovis points from one end to the other, from California and now New Jersey, and look at them and study them side by side, says Pegi Jodry, a curator in the museums archaeology department. She says the museum will make a cast of Noahs point for him.  Hurricane Sandy devastated Long Beach Island in October 2012, and its possible that efforts to restore sand to the beaches made Noahs discovery possible. The point may have been buried for thousands of years until those replenishment efforts moved sand around, a New Jersey archaeology expert\u00a0told Asbury Park Press. At the Natural History Museum yesterday, Dennis Stanford, the Smithsonians expert in Paleoindian archaeology and stone tool technology, showed Noah how ancient hunters would have attached the point to a spear and thrown it at creatures like mastodon. Its been used and re sharpened several times, Stanford told Noah about his artifact. Noahs response Whoa.  Experts consider the Clovis\u00a0to be among the first Americans. Stanford says the artifact is\u00a0a classic Clovis point, dating from 13,500 to 14,000 years ago and made of a silicate, probably jasper. The museum will conduct a morphometric analysis to study its shape and how it was made. Stanford says its black because it had been in salt water for so long, left behind when sea levels rose after the Ice Age. Noah is in the fifth grade and says his favorite school subject is science. Hes a fan of ancient artifacts. Before his grandfather passed away earlier this year, the two of them would walk around in search of arrowheads, which are typically around 5,000 years old. Noah says hes unsure of what he wants to be when he grows up, but Stanford hints that he should consider a career in archaeology. After all, Stanford discovered his first arrowhead when he was nine years old, he says, and look what happened to me.  Stanford says that Clovis points are rare, but its not uncommon to find them on beaches. However, usually someone goes looking for\u00a0them, not the other way around. Thats never happened to anybody that I know of, he says about the point washing up to Noah. You gotta be in the right place at the right time or it will disappear just like that. He was really lucky."}, {"title": "Ten Years On, the Flores \u201cHobbit\u201d Remains an Evolutionary Puzzle", "author": "Helen Thompson", "date": "October 22, 2014", "doc": "The ancient human known as the Hobbit has taken evolutionary biologists on a very unexpected journey. Back in 2004, a team led by archaeologists Mike Morwood and Peter Brown announced the discovery of a three foot tall hominin skeleton with an exceptionally small stature and skull, found in Liang Bua cave on the island of Flores in Indonesia. A series of papers released in 2009 described even more\u00a0fossils from the site, including\u00a0eight more Hobbit individuals.  Known to scientists as Homo floresiensis, the Hobbit has\u00a0no ordinary skeleton. Although parts of its anatomy resembled those of very ancient humans, dating analysis puts the skeleton at about 18,000 years old. That means the seemingly primitive species lived at the same time as modern humans Homo sapiens, which appeared about 200,000 years ago. In other words, the Hobbit appears to be the latest surviving human species, aside from our own.  This week marks the anniversary of the first publications in Nature describing the Hobbit, and even after a decade of debate, the tiny skeleton continues to provoke controversy. Some experts argue that the skeleton does not represent its own species and is simply a diseased modern human. Its easy to get lost in competing theories of where H. floresiensis came from and how it got to Indonesia, so heres our guide to what scientists know and dont know about this unusual discovery  Why is the Hobbit so weird? At first, archaeologists suspected they were looking at the bones of a modern human child. But closer analysis changed their tune. Older hominins, such as the 3.2 million year old Australopithecus afarensis, known from the famous Lucy fossil, have reinforced jaws, flared hipbones and short legs. Those same features show up in H. floresiensis. The Hobbits small skull indicates that the species had a brain the size of an orange, resembling another ancient species Homo habilis, which lived 2.4 to 1.4 million years ago. The Hobbit also possesses the furrowed brow ridges, thick skull and brain structure of Homo erectus, which appeared nearly 2 million years ago. As the researchers delved deeper, it became clear that H. floresiensis had a curious mix of modern and primitive traits. Its kind of like all of a\u00a0sudden there was this laboratory of human evolution that had been occurring on planet Earth that we didnt even know about, says Rick Potts, a paleoanthropologist who directs the National Museum of Natural Historys Human Origins program.      Are we sure the Hobbit isnt just a really short modern human? Given the young age of the skeleton, some experts have suggested that H. floresiensis represents a modern human with dwarfism, Down syndrome or other pathologies that might explain the small stature and brain. But no modern human pathology can explain all of the Hobbits features. Notably, the wrist bones of H. floresiensis dont contain certain hallmark features of the foot, face and wrist bones of modern humans, such as a boot shaped trapezoid bone in our wrists. That hasnt stopped scientists from arguing about whether H. floresiensis truly constitutes a unique species.  So where evolutionarily speaking did the Hobbit come from? Not the Shire. Perhaps the most widely accepted scenario is that H. floresiensis evolved from a version of H. erectus. Coincidentally, H. erectus remains have turned up on the Indonesian island of Java. The earliest H. erectus fossils unearthed outside of Africa, at Dmanisi in Georgia, have also shown that these hominins were not always the large strapping specimens we suspected them to be. Dmanisi skeletons are smaller and retain some primitive features. This all hints that a\u00a0group of early H. erectus could have made its way to mainland Southeast Asia, and a rogue population could have then been stranded on Flores and given rise to the Hobbit.  Could its origins be even older? That would certainly make things interesting. Given the similarities in anatomy to both Lucy and Homo habilis, its possible that the Hobbit had an older ancestor. If that were the case, wed need to rethink the spread of ancient humans out of Africa. It would mean that a whole branch of a human evolutionary tree in Asia had been missing until those fateful discoveries in Liang Bua, writes Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum in London, in a comment paper published in Nature today. However, an Australopithecus species like Lucy probably couldnt have made the trek from Africa across Asia to Indonesiait isnt until the rise of Homo erectus that we see legs strong enough for walking long distances.  Homo erectus wasnt exactly petite. How did the Hobbit get so small? In short, it shrunk. The leading theories suggest that the ancestor of H. floresiensis may have been subject to insular or island dwarfism. Islands come with a unique set of evolutionary pressures, among them limited and sometimes unreliable resources. To compensate, some animals evolve smaller body sizes that require less energy to maintain. If you want to survive on an island, you have to basically shrink down all of the organs of the body that are expensive, says Potts. Animal remains unearthed with H. floresiensis at Liang Bua included a dwarf species of primitive elephant called a Stegodon, along with normal sized Komodo dragons. Morwood and Brown posited that since island dwarfism was at play on Flores, it could have shaped the Hobbit and may explain the re emergence of primitive skeletal traits.  And why is its brain so small? Proponents of more modern origins for H. floresiensis have linked the small brain size to developmental disorders like microcephaly, which stunts the brains growth. Initially, researchers questioned whether island dwarfism could indeed shrink the brain to the degree seen in H. floresiensis. But a 2009 study\u00a0published in Nature found that in hippos undergoing island dwarfism on Madagascar, the brain does get disproportionally smaller than the body. A big brain requires a lot of expensive upkeep, so it makes sense that the brain might be subject to stronger evolutionary pressures.  How did the Hobbit get to Flores? Even during the last glacial maximum, when sea levels dropped drastically, Flores would not have been accessible from other Indonesian islands or mainland Southeast Asia. The ancestors of H. floresiensis would have needed a boat or raft. Though not out of the realm of possibility, theres no evidence that H. erectus built boats. More likely, a population of early H. erectus got stranded on a piece of vegetation or land, a micro island of sorts, that broke off from the mainland and bumped into Floresthis is actually not uncommon in coastal areas during a typhoon or tsunami.  When did the Hobbit get to Flores? The initial dating of volcanic ash in the sediment around the H. floresiensis fossils puts the bones between 38,000 and 18,000 years old. But other archaeological evidence, such as stone tools in Liang Bua cave, spans from 94,000 to 13,000 years ago. Smithsonian researchers are performing dating analyses on the skeletons in hopes of refining the Hobbits age. The oldest stone tools found on Flores date to 1.02 million years ago and may have belonged to H. floresiensis, or more likely their ancestors.  What answers will the next ten years bring? Any future skeletons unearthed at Liang Bua or elsewhere on Flores could fill in some blanks and probably settle the million dollar question of the Hobbits origins. That answer could impact how we imagine human evolution on mainland Asia and even how we think about human migration out of Africa. This article has been updated to reflect the most recent age estimate for the oldest stone tools on Flores. A previous version stated that they date back 880,000 years."}, {"title": "Carrion Beetles Were the First Caring Parents", "author": "Rachel Nuwer", "date": "September 17, 2014", "doc": "Good parents protect their babies from danger, feed them and teach them the ways of the world.

Unearthed at a dig in Egypt three years earlier, a few things set Spinosaurus apart right off the bat. Its lower jaw had a squared off end and its mouth was filled with unusual teeth that might have been used to catch fish. The fossil also sported long back spines, prompting Stromer to make a comparison to a crested chameleon.  The Egyptian fossilsvertebrae and a skull pieceeventually went on display at a paleontology museum in Munich, but the rise of the Nazi regime brought only loss for Stromer, a staunch critic of the Third Reich. He lost two sons to the war, and an Allied air strike on Munich destroyed the remains of S. aegyptiacus. Since then, only a few isolated Spinosaurus bones and teeth have shown up in fossil beds around the world. Without a more complete skeleton, the true nature and appearance of the mysterious dino was left up to speculation and the imagination of Jurassic Park III animators.  Now research funded by the National Geographic Society and published today in the journal Science re introduces the world to this bizarre ancient predatorand reveals that the animal probably spent its life both on land and in water.  Dinosaurs were far more diverse and adaptable than we give them credit for, says Nizar Ibrahim, a paleontologist at the University of Chicago and a National Geographic Emerging Explorer.  Stromers work in Egypt is in part what inspired Ibrahim to travel to the Sahara in search of African dinosaur fossils. While working on his doctorate degree in April 2008, Ibrahim stopped in a town called Erfoud, and a man with a mustache approached him with a cardboard box full of dinosaur fossils. The man, a local fossil hunter, wanted Ibrahims expertise in identifying the bones. Most were encased in sediment, but one struck Ibrahims eye a long, blade shaped bone with a reddish cross section. I had never seen anything like it before. I thought maybe this is a rib or maybe, just maybe, it could be the spine of a Spinosaurus, recalls Ibrahim.  He brought the fossils back to the Universite\u0301 Hassan II in Casablanca, thinking he might one day pin down their identity. In 2013, he heard from his Italian colleague Cristiano dal Sasso, also a co author, that the Natural History Museum of Milan had acquired a possible Spinosaurus specimen. On a visit, Ibrahim found himself facing a partial skeleton of what appeared to be Spinosaurus laid out in the museums basement.  The museum staff suspected the bones came from Morocco, but a private collector had donated the fossils, making it harder to interpret the find. In this case, it was difficult to tell whether all of these bones came from the same place without the actual context, says Ibrahim.  The bones had the same cross section coloration as those in the cardboard box, so Ibrahim and his colleagues resolved to track down the source the man with the mustache. After weeks trying to find him, the team was having tea at a caf\u00e9 in Erfoud when a tall figure dressed in white walked by. I just got a glimpse of his face, says Ibrahim. But I knew it was him. They ran after the man, and with a bit of convincing, he took them to the place where hed found the bones an almost cave like hole in a cliffside in the Saharas Kem Kem fossil beds.   Further excavations revealed more spines and other Spinosaurus bones, all likely belonging to one individual that lived in the area around 97 million years ago. The team sifted through photographs, drawings and field books belonging to Stromer and confirmed that this new specimen was the same species. To reconstruct the skeleton, they took computerized tomography CT scans of the newly discovered fossils as well as some from museums around the world. From Stromers archives, they created digital models of the jaw and vertebrae he first described, then they 3D printed a composite skeleton and created a flesh rendering. At 50 feet long, \u00a0Spinosaurus aegyptiacus exceeded the size of Tyrannosaurus rex by 9 feet. Its spines were at most 6.5 feet tallaround the average height of a professional basketball player. It was an incredibly large dinosaur, especially as far as predatory dinosaurs go, says Matt Lamanna, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh who was not affiliated with the study.  The Kem Kem beds mark what was once a tropical river system, a predators paradise. Other inhabitants included car sized coelacanths, sharks, crocodiles, flying reptiles and close relatives of T. rex. I call this place the most dangerous place in the history of our planet. Its full of predatory dinosaurs. Thats really unusual, says Ibrahim.  What really makes Spinosaurus special are its unique adaptations that may have allowed the dinosaur to hunt underwater. Like crocodiles, Spinosaurus had a long narrow snout with nostrils mid skull, perfect for submerging. It also had a second pair of openings, likely neurovascular slits that are also found in crocodiles. Spinosaurus had a long neck, like a heron or a stork. Large, cone shaped teeth and powerful, clawed arms might have been used to catch and eat fish, a behavior supported by previous oxygen isotope analysis that pointed to Spinosaurus being a pescatarian.  Spinosauruss pelvis was small but attached to powerful, short legs, similar to the ancient ancestors of whales. Its big feet had flat claws, a structure that may have been useful for paddling. Loosely connected tail bones could have allowed the animal to propel itself forward in water just like a fish, and its densely packed bones resemble those of a penguin.  It was a chimera half duck, half crocodile. We dont have anything alive that looks like this today, says study co author Paul Sereno, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Chicago.  The great remaining mystery is the function of those long spines on the back vertebrae, says Hans Dieter Sues, a vertebrate paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History who was not affiliated with the work. Previously, researchers suggested that the spines might be embedded in a hump, similar to the ones on buffalo used for fat storage and display.  Instead, Ibrahim and his team detected potential evidence of skin attachments along the spine that could have created a sail like structure. If youre mostly swimming around and spend a lot of time submerged in the water, the sail is the one part of your body thats going to stick out and be visible from far away, explains Ibrahim. The size of your sail could tell other animals something about your age, your size, to ensure that they dont come and enter your fishing grounds.  While aquatic reptiles did exist in the ancient past, the idea of an aquatic dinosaur has put paleontologists at odds for decades. Without a time machine, its impossible to know what any extinct animal did, says Lamanna. And while a semi aquatic lifestyle is just one possible explanation for Spinosaurus adaptations, multiple lines of evidence back up the theory that this dinosaur\u00a0might have been aquatic, he says.  Sues agrees It seemed that dinosaurs were mostly land dwelling animals. Spinosaurus has now changed that picture again.  An exhibition entitled Spinosaurus Lost Giant of the Cretaceous will feature the find at the National Geographic Museum in Washington, D.C., from September 12, 2014 to April 12, 2015. It includes the digital model, 3D printed skeleton, and fleshed out rendering of what Spinosaurus aegyptiacus might have looked like. The swimming dinosaur will also be the topic of a National GeographicNOVA special airing on PBS Nov. 5 at 9 pm, and a feature story in the October issue of National Geographic magazine."}, {"title": "This Weird, 500 Million-Year-Old Spiky Worm With Legs Actually Has a Descendant", "author": "Rachel Nuwer", "date": "August 18, 2014", "doc": "Around 505 million years ago, a spiky worm with clawed legs crawled around the ocean floor in what is today the Rocky Mountains in Canada.

A Brazilian research team has discovered fossils from a new species of pterosaurthe distant, flying reptile cousins of dinosaursthat lived 75 to 87 million years ago in the ancient Caiu\u00e1 Desert.  The huge bone bed, outside the city of Cruzeiro do Oeste, contains hundreds of specimens of the novel species, dubbed Caiuajara dobruskii. The discovery provides a window into the pterosaur world, revealing that these animals were quick to take flight after birth, and that they may have been social creatures that nested in big, bustling communities.  Geologic evidence puts the bone bed in the late Cretaceous period and suggests that pterosaurs lived near small lakes in the surrounding desert, as well as along the coast of northern Brazil. These animals lived in rare humid regions among the dunes, like oases, says Luiz Carlos Weinsch\u00fctz, a geologist at the Universidade do Contestados paleontological center in Mafra, Brazil.  Local\u00a0Alexander Dobruski and his son Jo\u00e3o discovered the site while digging a runoff ditch back in 1971. In 1975, they sent off fossil samples for scientific study, but the bones sat in storage for the next three decades. In 2011, Weinsch\u00fctz and his colleague Paulo C\u00e9sar Manzig, a paleontologist at the Universidade do Contestado, stumbled upon them while doing research for a book on Brazilian fossils. The researchers traveled to Cruzeiro do Oeste to literally do some digging. When we arrived at the discovery site, the bones were visiblemany pterosaur bones right in front of my eyes, recalls Manzig. It was one of the most exciting moments of my life.    After carefully excavating 66 square feet of the sandstone site, the researchers uncovered at least 47 individual pterosaurs, including many juveniles. The reptiles had wingspans of 2.1 to 7.7 feet, ranging from the size of a model airplane to an albatross. They also lacked teeth and may have been\u00a0frugivores, relying on a heavy fruit diet.  By analyzing the shapes of the fossilized bones and the presence of different anatomical characteristics, the researchers were able to figure out what branch of the pterosaur family tree gave rise to these particular creatures. A few clues then led the team to conclude that they were looking at an entirely new species. For one, all of the individuals had a unique divet in the jaw and a bony ridge above the eye. Like many other winged reptiles, this group of pterosaurs also had unique head crests. Adults had steeper, larger crests, while juveniles had smaller, less sloped ones.  Some researchers think that the crests were only display structures, others envision them as being a form of sexual dimorphismmales have them, females dont. Personally, I think it was a mix of different functions, explains\u00a0Alexander Kellner, a paleontologist at the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janiero and another co author on the study. With both adults and young at the site, the researchers gleaned some insight into the pterosaurs\u00a0growth cycle. Adults and juveniles dont show huge differences in their skeletons and\u00a0wings, so the pterosaurs likely started flying at a young age. As a result, they probably didnt require a lot of parental supervision and experienced a more reptilian upbringing, more like crocodiles or turtles than mammals or birds.     Finding such a high volume of these creatures is rare, and the fact that they were discovered clumped together within the same 5 foot rock layer points to the animals living and dying in the same place. Along with other recent pterosaur finds, it paints a compelling picture of pterosaurs nesting together and living in colonies. This certainly indicates that at least some of these animals were gregarious, says\u00a0Mark Witton, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth in the U.K. The lake that\u00a0Caiuajara\u00a0lived next to must have been swarming with pterosaurs.\u00a0  Others are hesitant to rule out alternative explanations. Seasonal flooding could have washed bones into the area from animals that died elsewhere. Such mass accumulations are not uncommon and are not necessarily evidence of animals living and dying in groups, says\u00a0Hans Dieter Sues, a vertebrate paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.  So what killed these particular flying lizards? Bones were mixed together and interred at different times, so multiple causes of death are probably at play. Drought and desert storms are the main contenders, though. Any climate oscillation might have been fatal for fragile individuals, says Weinsch\u00fctz. Sporadic storms could have carried bones to the bottom of the desert lakes.  The ongoing excavations could yield further answers. By the Brazilian teams estimates, the bone bed spans an area of about 4300 square feet. Thats about the size of a swimming pool, and excavators have only unearthed 5 percent of the site.

The remains, they concluded, belonged to a distinct species of Homo, whose notably tiny size soon earned it the nickname the Flores hobbit.\u00a0 As The New York Times writes, those findings, however, were almost immediately subject to debate. Some thought that a single skull was too little evidence to base an entire species on, while others questioned that the skulls small size might be the result of a disease rather than a unique species.\u00a0 Now, the debate has reignited with two new papers published this week by a team of\u00a0researchers from Penn State and other institutions.

Then theres the fact that the cave is not easily accessedyou can only get to it by rappelling in on a ropewhich means the remains are largely undisturbed.\u00a0Its so cold all year long, that it has got just the perfect conditions for preserving DNA, in multiple species, in large numbers of individuals, Meachen told the AP.

Today the environment is within the Gobi Deserta far cry from lush, temperate lakeshore it once was. But the Gobis dry, arid climate makes for excellent fossil preservation. In 2005, researchers came across evidence of the areas former inhabitants pterosaurs, a group of flying reptiles that includes the pterodactyl family. Recent excavations of the site have yielded a plethora of fossil specimens of these ancient reptile residents, including the most juvenile of themtheir eggs. A team of paleontologists from China and Brazil found that the unearthed bones and fossilized eggs actually represent a previously unknown genus and species of pterosaur. They published their results today in Current Biology. Before getting into the nitty gritty details of the discovery, its important to note that pterosaurs arent dinosaurs. These reptiles share a different evolutionary history to their dino cousins. Thus, unlike dinosaurs, they arent directly related to birds either. Pterosaurs dominated the skies during the Cretaceous and Jurassic periods, but pterosaurs and birds are two evolutionary paths that separately reached the skill set of flight. In the fossil record, pterosaurs are rare commodities only one or two fossil specimen define each species, and only four eggs have ever been unearthedall are smushed or flattened. That makes the Turpan Hami fossils extremely valuable for analyzing nesting habits. As the researchers write, sites like the one reported here provide further evidence regarding the behavior and biology of this amazing group of flying reptiles that has no parallel in modern time. After the researchers realized they had a huge pterosaur find on their hands, they began systematically excavating the site, and in 2008, they came across their first egg I was more excited than surprised, says Xiaolin Wang, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. With such a fossil rich site, finding an egg wasnt out of the realm of possibility. The team recovered five eggs in total from the site. Microscopic and spectroscopic analysis revealed that the eggs had a thin shell for a\u00a0top layer, made mostly of calcium carbonate, and underneath that lay a soft, thin membrane. It is similar to soft eggs of some modern snakes the size and structure are nearly the same, says Wang. Beyond cracking the mystery of the eggs, the researchers also wanted to figure out how the Turpan Hami Basin pterosaurs fit into the larger pterosaur family tree. They had removed fossilized bones from 40 individuals at Turban Hami, though the entire site could ultimately yield hundreds. After a closer examination of the bones, they found that these animals had marked differences from other species a hooked bone at the end of the jaw, wider eye cavities, a well developed forehead crest, a wrist bone with a protruding spike, and other unique features. Their wingspans ranged from 4\u00a0feet to 11\u00a0feet, and an evolutionary tree analysis suggested that the individuals belonged to a new genus and species of pterosaur, which the scientists named Hamipterus tianshanensis. As they unearthed the specimens, the researchers also noticed that some individuals had the same skull in shape and size but different head crests some were large, wrinkled, with a flare at the end of their snout, while others were smaller, smoother, and less protruding. The researchers think theyve happened upon a sexually dimorphic traitone that separates the boys from the girls. Though some modern reptile species do have larger females, the\u00a0trend in reptiles\u00a0is big males, small females. So, Wang and his colleagues made the educated guess that, in the case of the pterosaurs, larger crests belong to males and the smaller crests to females. For creatures like pterosaurs and dinosaurs, figuring out which has male bits and which has female bits can be a window into the lives of these ancient beasts. But as you might expect, sexual dimorphismthough suspected in pterosaurscan be hard to nail down in fossilized animals. More analysis is needed to say for sure. In addition, finding the bones and eggs present a picture of gregarious social life and reproduction behaviors that resembles that of modern reptiles. These pterosaurs nested in the shore of the ancient lake and buried their eggs in the moist sand, says Wang. The nesting behavior is similar to modern snake species, particularly\u00a0rat snakes. Finding in one location evidence of sexual dimorphism and of behaviors that are much more reptile like than bird like is quite\u00a0rare. This is something of a Holy Graila site potentially recording all of these interesting aspects in the same locality, notes\u00a0Mark Witton, a paleontologist at the University of Portsmouth who was not affiliated with the study. A long extinct group of flying reptiles may seem unimportant in the big scheme of things, but theyre a component of something we must pay more attention to our changing biosphere, Witton added. Looking at the way species and ecosystems have evolved through\u00a0Deep Time\u00a0gives us the only long term insight into the way the natural world workshow it adapts to adversity, when it blooms and diversifies, and so forth. It also shows how populations can be snuffed outnear this lake, the nesting pterosaurs also met their demise. The fossil containing rock layers at Turpan Hami are divided by the mud and sand deposits traditionally left by huge storms. These storm layers, called\u00a0tempestites, form when debris from different sediments mix together in the storms deluge. Heres what the scholars think may have happened The storm may have killed live pterosaurs, and transported the dead bodies and eggs for a short distance, says Wang And then buried them quickly. It must have been horrible way to go for these ancient creatures, but a perfect storm for researchers, who now have a better picture of what life was like when lizards dominated the land and sky."}, {"title": "DNA From 12,000-Year-Old Skeleton Helps Answer the Question: Who Were the First Americans?", "author": "Mohi Kumar", "date": "May 15, 2014", "doc": "Some 12,000 years ago, a teenage girl took a walk in whats now the Yucatan Peninsula and fell 190 feet into a deep pit, breaking her pelvis and likely killing her instantly. Over time, the pitpart of an elaborate limestone cave systembecame a watery grave as the most recent ice age ended, glaciers melted and sea levels rose. In 2007, cave divers happened upon her remarkably preserved remains, which form the oldest, most complete and genetically intact human skeleton in the New World. Her bones, according to\u00a0new research published in Science, hold the key to a question that has long plagued scientists Who were the first Americans? Prevailing ideas point to all Native Americans descending from ancient Siberians who moved across the\u00a0Beringia land bridge\u00a0between Asia and North America between 26,000 and 18,000 years ago. As time wore on, the thinking goes, these people spread southward and gave rise to the Native American populations encountered by European settlers centuries ago. But therein lies a puzzle Modern Native Americans closely resemble people of China, Korea, and Japan but the oldest American skeletons do not, says archaeologist and paleontologist James Chatters, lead author on the study and the owner of Applied Paleoscience, a research consulting service based in Bothell, Washington. The small number of early American specimens discovered so far have smaller and shorter faces and longer and narrower skulls than later Native Americans, more closely resembling the modern people of Africa, Australia, and the South Pacific. This has led to speculation that perhaps the first Americans and Native Americans came from different homelands, Chatters continues, or migrated from Asia at different stages in their evolution. The newly discovered skeletonnamed Naia by the divers who discovered her, after the Greek for watershould help to settle this speculation. Though her skull is shaped like those of other early Americans, she shares a DNA sequence with some modern Native Americans. In other words, shes likely a genetic great aunt to indigenous people currently found in the Americas. To reach these findings, scientists had to first conclusively determine Naias age. It helped that the cave she was found ina submerged chamber called Hoyo Negro Spanish for black hole of the Sac Atun\u00a0cave system, accessible only by divers climbing down a 30 foot ladder in a nearby sinkhole, swimming along a 200 foot tunnel, then making a final 100 foot dropwas littered with fossils of saber toothed tigers, giant ground sloths, cave bears and even an elephant like creature called a gomphothere. These creatures last walked on Earth thousands of years ago during the last ice age. But the researchers needed to get more specific than that. So they took a close look at regional sea level data to get a minimum age at which the cave filled with seawater. Their analysis showed that the site, which is now 130 feet below sea level, would have been become submerged between 9,700 and 10,200 years ago. Thus, Naia had to have fallen into the cave before then. Unlike previous skeletons of early Americans, Naias included her teeth. Led by co author Douglas Kennett, a professor of environmental archaeology at the Pennsylvania State University, researchers radiocarbon dated her tooth enamel to 12,900 years ago. But Naias exposure to seawater within the limestone caves, however, had mineralized her bones. Unfortunately, we cant rule out that the tooth enamel is contaminated with secondary carbonates from the cave system, Kennett explains. Tooth enamel also contains trace amounts of uranium and thorium, radioactive minerals that decay at known rates. But results from those analyses, while they indicated that the remains were at least 12,000 years old, were also inconclusive. However the scientists noticed something interesting about the bones themselves they were spotted with rosette looking mineral deposits. Before the cave was submerged, water dripping from the caves roof created a mineral mist that dried on the bones in floret patterns. Because the florets grew on the human bones, we knew that dating them would give us a minimum age for the bones, explains Victor Polyak, a research scientist at the University of New Mexicos Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. And again, given that Hoyo Negro pit was dry when Naia made her way to the bottom, the florets had to have grown between the time of her death and 10,000 years ago when the bottom of the pit became submerged by brackish water because of rising sea level. Therefore, the oldest pieces of florets provided the oldest minimum age. Analysis of these florets agreed with other readingsNaia fell into cave no earlier than 12,000 years ago. Naias teeth had another role to play With her age established, scientists then sought to extract her DNA from her molars. \u00a0We tried a DNA extraction on the outside chance some fragments might remain, says Chatters. I was shocked when we actually got intact DNA. The researchers focused on mitochondrial DNA mtDNA, which is used by geneticists to examine how populations are related. mtDNA is more abundant than DNA found in a cells nucleus, so its easier to study. Researchers focused especially on haplotypes, which are sequences of genes that mutate more slowly than the rest of the mtDNA. Their analysis showed that Naias mtDNA contains a haplotype that occurs in modern Native Americans and only is found in the Americas scientists believe it evolved in Beringia. We were able to identify her genetic lineage with high certainty, says Ripan Malhi, a professor of anthropology at the University of Illinois. Malhis lab was one of three that analyzed Naias mtDNA all three analyses yielded the same results. This shows that living Native Americans and these ancient remains of the girl we analyzed all came from the same source population during the initial peopling of the Americas. Naia proves that migrations from Beringia made it to southern Mexico. As for why Naias skull is so different from modern Native Americans, co  author Deborah Bolnick, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Texas at Austin has an explanation The physical differences between Paleoamericans and Native Americans today are more likely due to changes that occurred in Beringia and the Americas over the last 9,000 years. Bolnicks lab was one of the three to confirm the mtDNA findings. Studies of Naianamely the fact that shes a genetic forerunner to modern Native Americansironically raises some interesting questions about whether scientists will be able to get access and extract the remains of early Americans yet to be uncovered. For example, Chatterswho discovered the scientific importance of the 9000 year old Kennewick Man in 1996could not further analyze those remains due to local tribes claiming the body as an ancestor under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act NAGPRA, passed in 1990. However, in 2004, the 9th\u00a0Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a previous decision that ruled that the remains could not be defined as Native American under NAGPRA law, and studies of the body resumed. Naias discovery may open the door to more legal struggles in the future. But Chatters dismisses this idea, noting that in the current study, Were not looking at an ancestor descendent relationship here necessarily. Were simply looking at a common heritage.

The sperm are approximately\u00a017\u00a0million\u00a0years\u00a0old and belonged to creatures called ostracodstiny freshwater shrimp. The fossilized specimen, found within the reproductive tract of several\u00a0females and within a male,\u00a0also revealed that the ostracods ancient sperm were relatively massive. At about 1.3 mm, they\u00a0stretched\u00a0at least the length of the males bodies, if not more. To manage them, the males produced the sperm in tightly wound bundles.\u00a0 The fossils were actually discovered back in 1988, but it took a while for researchers to realize they contained the remains of fossilized soft tissue, the team explains. In addition to the giant sperm cells themselves, the team also found the remains of structures called Zenker organs, which acted as biological pumps for transferring sperm from males to females.\u00a0 Bats, the researchers point out, probably receive the credit for preserving the amazing shrimp specimens. Today, the site where the researchers found the fossils appears dry and barren, but 17 million years ago it was a bustling rainforest ecosystem. Bats roosted above the ostracods jungle pool, and the nutrients from their droppings likely helped preserve the shrimp. So the key to eternal preservation of soft tissues may indeed be some magic ingredient in bat droppings,\u00a0the researchers joked in a release."}, {"title": "Paleoartist Brings Human Evolution to Life ", "author": "Helen Thompson", "date": "May 7, 2014", "doc": "A smiling 3.2 million year old face greets visitors to the anthropology hall of the National Museum of Anthropology and History in Mexico City. This reconstruction of the famous Australopithecus afarensis specimen dubbed Lucy stands a mere 4 feet tall, is covered in dark hair, and displays a pleasant gaze. Shes no ordinary mannequin Her skin looks like it could get goose bumps, and her frozen pose and expression make\u00a0you wonder if shell start walking and talking at any moment. This hyper realistic depiction of Lucy comes from the Atelier Dayn\u00e8s studio in Paris, home of French sculptor and painter Elisabeth Dayn\u00e8s. Her 20 year career is a study in human evolutionin addition to Lucy, shes recreated Sahelanthropus tchadensis, as well as Paranthropus boisei, Homo erectus, and Homo floresiensis, just to name a few. Her works appear in museums across the globe, and in 2010, Dayn\u00e8s won the prestigious J. Lanzendorf PaleoArt Prize for her reconstructions. Though she got her start in the make up department of a theater company, Dayn\u00e8s had an early interest in depicting realistic facial anatomy and skin in theatrical masks. When she opened her Paris studio, she began developing relationships with scientific labs. This interest put her on the radar of the Thot Museum in Montignac, France, and in 1988, they tapped Dayn\u00e8s to reconstruct a mammoth and a group of people from the Magdalenian culture who lived around 11,000 years ago. Through this initial project, Dayn\u00e8s found her calling. I knew it straight away after my first contact with this field, when I understood how infinite scientific research and creativity could be, she says. Although her sculpting techniques continue to evolve, she still follows the same basic steps. No matter the reconstruction, Dayn\u00e8s always starts with a close examination of the ancient humans skulla defining feature for many hominid fossil groups. Computer modeling of 18 craniometric data points across a skull specimen gives her estimates of musculature and the shape of the nose, chin, and forehead. These points guide Dayn\u00e8s as she molds clay to form muscles, skin and facial features across a cast of the skull. Additional bones and teeth provide more clues to body shape and stature. Next, Dayn\u00e8s makes a silicone cast of the sculpture, a skin like canvas on which shell paint complexion, beauty spots\u00a0and veins. For hair, she typically uses human hair in members of the\u00a0Homo\u00a0genus, mixing in yak hair for a thicker effect in older hominids. Dental and eye prosthetics complete the sculptures form. For hair and eye color decisions, Dayn\u00e8s gets inspiration from the scientific literature for example, genetic evidence\u00a0suggests\u00a0that Neanderthals had\u00a0red hair. She also consults with scientific experts on the fossil group at each stage of the reconstruction process. Her first collaboration with a scientist on a reconstruction came in 1998 when she teamed up with longtime friend\u00a0Jean N\u00f6el Vignal, a paleoanthropologist and former head of the Police Forensic Research Institute in Paris, to reconstruct a Neanderthal from Frances\u00a0La Ferrassie\u00a0cave site. Vignal had developed the computer modeling programs used to estimate muscle and skin thickness. Forensic sleuthing, she says, is the perfect guide She approaches a reconstruction like a investigator profiling a murder victim. The skull, other bone remains and flora and fauna found in the excavation all help develop a picture of the individual her age, what she ate, what hominid group she belonged to, any medical conditions she may have suffered from, and where and when she lived. More complete remains yield more accurate reconstructions. Lucy proved an exceptionally difficult reconstruction, spanning eight months. Dayn\u00e8s synthesizes all of the scientific data about that point in hominid evolution into one sculpture, presenting a hypothesis of what the individual looked like. But the full reconstruction is both an artistic and scientific challenge, she says. Reaching an emotional impact and transmitting life requires\u00a0important artistic work unlike a conventional reconstruction that would be realized in a forensic laboratory, explains Dayn\u00e8s. Theres no scientific method to predict what anger or wonder or love might have looked like on the face of\u00a0Homo erectus, for example. So for facial expressions, Dayn\u00e8s goes with artistic intuition, based on the hominid family, exhibition design, and any inspiration conjured by the skull itself. She also turns to the expressions of modern humans I cut out different looks from recent photos in magazines that hit me and that I think can apply to a specific individual. For example, Dayn\u00e8s modeled a\u00a0Neanderthal man\u00a0looking powerlessly at his companion, wounded in a hunting accident, for the\u00a0CosmoCaixa\u00a0Museum of Barcelona, on a\u00a0Life\u00a0magazine photo of two American soldiers in Vietnam. Through these expressions and the realistic feel of the sculptures, Dayn\u00e8s also tries to dispel stereotypes of ancient hominids being violent, brutish, stupid, or inhuman. I am proud to know that they will shake up common preconceptions, Dayn\u00e8s says. When this happens, the satisfaction is greatthis is the promise that visitors will wonder about their origins. Daynes has several upcoming exhibitions at\u00a0museums around the world. At the\u00a0Montreal Science Centre, four of Dayn\u00e8s reconstructions of Magdalenian painters is on view through September 2014. In Pori, Finland, the\u00a0Satakunta Museum\u00a0features Dayn\u00e8s reconstructions of Neanderthals in an exhibition focused on the world they inhabited. Two additional exhibitions will launch later this year in Bordeaux, France, and in Chile."}, {"title": "Cougars Survived the Pleistocene Extinction Because They\u2019ll Eat Just About Anything Meaty ", "author": "Rachel Nuwer", "date": "April 24, 2014", "doc": "Cougars are not picky eaters. Theyll scarf down pretty much any animal that crosses their path,\u00a0living or already dead. Whats more, they finish their meal,\u00a0bones and all. A cougar does not leave any scraps.\u00a0 This dietary indiscretion might have been key to the survival of modern cougars\u00a0ancestors, according to research\u00a0from Vanderbilt University. Around 12,000 years ago, big mammals around the world fell by the wayside in whats known as the Late Pleistocene extinction. The event was likely caused by changes in climate as well as a new predator on the blockhumans. In the Americas, four of six big cat species went extinct during this time, leaving only cougars and jaguars to roam that land mass.\u00a0 Diets, the reserachers think, made the difference, at least for cougars.

The arrival of the Nations T. Rex marks both the end of the specimens long journey from its previous home at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana, and the end of the Smithsonians long quest to acquire a T. rex specimen. Originally named for its discoverer, rancher Kathy Wankel who found it in 1988 in eastern Montana, the fossil was excavated by paleontologist Jack Horner in 1989 to 1990. The 65 million year old specimen is one of the most complete T. rex skeletons found. At 38 feet long and weighing in at 7 tons, the fossil skeleton now called the Nations T rex will get its moment in the spotlight, as part of the museums dinosaur hall, which will close for renovations on April 28 to reopen again in 2019. In June of last year, the Smithsonian reached an agreement with the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the skeleton is on loan to the Smithsonian for the next 50 years. At 80 to 85 percent of a full T. rex skeleton, the Wankel T. rex is among the most complete fossils of its kind unearthed, second only to the Chicago Field Museums Sue, which the Smithsonian tried to acquire in 1997. Beyond these stunning skeletal displays, paleontologists have found some 50 T. rex specimens, since Henry Fairfield Osborn first described the species in 1905. The king of reptiles, though mighty and well documented in the fossil record, remains largely a mystery to paleontologists who have yet to understand the creatures basic lifestyle and biology. Weve culled scientific reports to bring you five questions that have yet to be answered What did\u00a0T. rex\u00a0look like? Did it sport scales, colors, feathers or all of the above? Paleontologists have long debated this. A string of studies in the past decade have pointed to the potential widespread presence of either feathers or fuzz like proto feathers in dinosaur species. In 2012, paleontologists\u00a0found\u00a0that a\u00a0T. rex\u00a0relative,\u00a0Yutyrannus huali, had filamentous feathers. If a relative had feathers, why not the king of reptiles itself? Until a specimen is found with preserved imprints of feathers, though, the jury is out. We have some opportunity to know if they had feathers because we can find impressions, says\u00a0Matthew Carrano, curator of dinosaurs at the National Museum of Natural History. But its highly unlikely that we will ever know its color or the texture of its skin. Some scientists have proposed methods of predicting dinosaur color based on the shapes of what they believe to be remains of structures that contain melanin, the pigment responsible for darker colors in modern animals. But other researchers suggest that the structures might instead be the remains of bacterial colonies. Evidence of\u00a0T. rex\u00a0skinwhether from impressions or preserved skinwould obviously shed light on the issue, but so far paleontologists havent had any luck there. Having darker colored skin certainly might have been an advantageous camouflage for\u00a0T. rex\u00a0as a predator. Though evidence of skin from many other ancient reptiles exists in the fossil record,\u00a0T. rex\u00a0skin has yet to be discovered, which raises questions of whether it might have been more easily degradable. It could be something that has to do with feathers in the skin itself changing the texture and the resistance of skin, which perhaps made it more likely to degrade than typical scaly skin, says\u00a0Mary Schweitzer, a molecular paleontologist at the North Carolina State University who specializes in the\u00a0remnants of ancient tissue. Schweitzer speculates that the skin of a mature\u00a0T. rex, without the feathers, would probably be kind of like chicken legs. Probably scaly, probably pretty resistant to water and degradation at least while theyre alive. Chance of an answer?\u00a0Its looking more and more likely that\u00a0T. rex\u00a0had feathers, but coloration and skin texture remain unknown, for now. What did\u00a0T. rex\u00a0eggs and babies look like? T. rex\u00a0juveniles are extremely rare in the fossil record. Some scientists\u00a0suggest\u00a0this is because many juveniles survived to adulthood, but it could also be due to a fossil hunters bias, to seek out and find big specimens. Theres also the possibility that scientists have simply been misidentifying another related, much smaller species of tyrannosaur, called\u00a0Nanotyrannus lancensis, that might instead represent\u00a0T. rex\u00a0juveniles.\u00a0Nanotyrannus\u00a0frequently pops up in the same fossil beds as\u00a0T. rex, however,\u00a0a 2010 study\u00a0examining the skull of a hallmark\u00a0Nanotyrannus\u00a0specimen found distinct differences in the sinus and brain casing features. Only further fossil finds will confirm whether\u00a0Nanotyrannus\u00a0is a baby\u00a0T. rex\u00a0or a distinct species. As for\u00a0T. rex\u00a0babies Perhaps the young were born with a fluffy feather coat, a common phenomenon in birds, and then lost the majority of their feathers once they reached adulthood. The bigger you are the harder it is to lose heat, says Schweitzer. So, when youre little, as most critters are when they hatch out, you need insulation or their metabolism would have to be fast enough to maintain body temperature. Scientists dont know if\u00a0T. rex\u00a0was totally warm blooded or cold blooded, but they think that the giants metabolic rate was probably somewhere in between that of crocodiles and birds. A study published last year in\u00a0PLOS One\u00a0suggests\u00a0that cold blooded energetics could not have fueled dinosaurs active lifestyles, and thus they probably didnt regulate their body temperature exclusively by moving into the sun, as modern lizards and crocodiles are known do. If the\u00a0PLOS One\u00a0study is true, it is even more likely that newborns had feathers. Chance of an answer\u00a0The gold standard would be the epic find of a young\u00a0T. rex\u00a0inside an egg. No\u00a0T. rex\u00a0eggs have ever been discovered, though scientists have stumbled upon eggs from many other dinosaur species. To you or me, they look like bird eggs. We hold out that we can find one, says Carrano.\u00a0 What kind of sounds did the king make?  The ominous roar of a T. rex, made familiar by the Jurassic Park movies, is nothing more than the product of a filmmakers creative imagination. Scientists look to modern relatives of the T. rexbirds and reptilesfor indications of what the dinosaurs might have sounded like, if they made any vocalizations at all. In reality, their calls may have been more like a shriek or a grumble than a roar. We can guess that it might have sounded like a crocodile or an ostrich, but definitely not a lion and therefore no roaring or purring, says Carrano. Chance of an answer Nil. The only thing that would prove it is a Mesozoic era recording of the creature.\u00a0 How did T. rex get it on?  When Osborn\u00a0described T. rex in 1905, he posited that the animals short forelimb was a grasping organ in copulation, forever imprinting the image of two giant reptiles getting it on with grasping tiny arms. If in fact they were feathered, plumage could play a role in precopulatory courting rituals, extending that entertaining image. In order to pin down the logistics of how these 7 ton animals mated and reproduced, paleontologists need to know which fossils are male and which are female. Unfortunately, T. rex skeletons dont exhibit a lot of sexually dimorphic characteristics. However, in 2005, Schweitzer found evidence in a Tyrannosaurus rex from the Hell Creek Formation of medullary bone, a type of tissue that accumulates in female birds during ovulation. This type of bone develops to provide calcium to the eggshell. Scientists hypothesized that dinosaurs also had to provide this calcium, and so Schweitzers find was a key clue to how T. rex youngsters came to be. Chance of an answer We dont know the logistics, says Carrano. We can theorize these are pretty big animalsseven ton animals that stood on two legs. Scientists might look to giraffes or elephants, but they obviously arent perfect models. What did T. rex use its arms for? The mysterious function of T. rexs short arms has provided an endless source of amusement on the internet. But scientists too have been perplexed by the dichotomy of such a large animal with such tiny, seemingly useless forelimbs. Similar to the initial idea that T. rex used its arms to hold its mate, some have suggested that the arms kept prey in placea study from 1990 hypothesized that the arms could maneuver at least 400 poundsor provided lift when the animal stood up on two legs, assuming the animals ever sat on the ground. As far as current theories go, the idea that T. rexs forelimbs are in fact totally useless is growing in popularity, says Sara Burch, a paleontologist at Ohio University. But Burch isnt convinced and is trying to reconstruct the muscle layout of T. rexs forelimbs based on the forelimb muscles of its modern relatives and the shape of the bones. Chance of an answer Not out of the realm of possibility. I think with the new methods of muscle reconstruction and 3D modeling out there, we will definitely narrow down the possibilities of uses for the forelimb, says Burch. The Nations T. rex contains one of most complete forelimbs in the fossil record.

The footprints trailed over a pathway nearly 150 feet long. The whole track, though, was\u00a0carved up into smaller specimens and distributed. Over the years, many of the blocks disappeared from the record\u00a0entirely.\u00a0 But\u00a0even things that are lost can still be found, sometimes.\u00a0A new study published in PLOS One shows how researchers took a closer look at 17 photographs of the site that were taken decades ago, before it was dismantled. Using a technique called photogrammetry, they were able to re create the scene on a computer, a technique that could be immensely valuable to both paleontologists and archaeologists in the future. From the BBC Dr Falkingham said Here were showing that you can do this to lost or damaged specimens or even entire sites if you have photographs taken at the time.

A cross between a lizard and a chicken in appearance, its limbs were long and graceful and, counting its tail, it stretched to 11 feet in length. Despite an unassuming stature of just five feet, the dinosaur wasnt without its defenses Large, sharp claws tipped its forelimbs. The species, newly named Anzu wyliei and described by researchers at Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History and the University of Utah, belongs to Oviraptorosauria, a group of dinosaurs known for nearly a century from a few bits of fossilized bone in North America, but more substantial specimens from Asia. With the discovery of A. wyliei, we finally have the fossil evidence to show what this species looked like, and how it is related to other dinosaurs, says Hans Dieter Sues, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the National Museum of Natural History and a member of the team that published a paper on A. wyliei in PLOS One. To reconstruct A. wyliei, the team analyzed three partial skeletons, all found in the fossil rich Hell Creek Formation, a late Cretaceous rock deposit that was once a swampy forest. Private collectors dug up two of the skeletons only 50 feet from one another in a portion of the formation in South Dakota, and they were later purchased by the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, where Sues, an expert in Oviraptorosauria, previously worked. The third Anzu skeleton was discovered by Tyler Lyson, now a post doctorate at the Natural History Museum, who first sighted the bones as a teenager while exploring his uncles ranch in North Dakota. In 2006, Lyson and Emma Schachner of the University of Utah attended a meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. There, they presented a poster describing their bones three vertebrae, a radius, an ulna, a rib and a scapulocoracoid, a shoulder bone. While at the conference, they met Sues and Matthew Lamanna, the new papers lead author and assistant curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, who had been studying the two skeletons from the Carnegie Museum. Each had heard about the other groups skeleton, and they were curious to compare notes to see if the similar sounding fossils were related. It was quite clear that all three specimens belonged to the same new species, says Sues. So we suggested that we just pool our fossils and work on them as a team. It took the team eight years to reconstruct and study Anzu, creating a skeleton that was 75 to 80 percent complete. Along the way, the researchers came to some interesting conclusions Because it had jaws that could cut and shear food but no teeth, Lyson and Sues assume it ate both animals and plants, and perhaps eggs. Two of the specimens had injuries. One a broken rib, and another an arthritic toe, which Lamanna says was probably excruciatingly painful. The two animals, he says, led pretty rough lives. Paleontologists have long guessed that dinosaurs like Anzu existed in North America because of bits of bone found that resembled other Oviraptorosauria fossils known from Asia. In 1997, Sues published a paper that linked Oviraptorosauria jaw and hand specimens found in North America. But the specimens from Asia tended to be smaller and have shorter, fatter legs, as well as different beaks and lower jaws. We knew that there was a group of Oviraptorosaurs in North America, but we didnt know many fundamental things about them, Lamanna says. What they looked like, how exactly they were related to their Asian cousins, how they lived, how big they got, all these things. Anzu helps to answer all of these questions. One question, however, that stymied Lamanna was what to name the creature. It looks like a giant, scary bird, says Lamanna, who, along with colleagues, nicknamed it the Chicken From Hell. So I wanted to try to invoke that nickname in coming up with an official name for the animal, because I think its a pretty good description. Lamanna eventually decided upon Anzu, a feathered demon from Mesopotamian mythology. Anzus skeleton has solved some mysteries, but not all of them, says James Clark, a paleontologist at George Washington University who was not involved in the study. Theyve got these weird heads, but the rest of the body doesnt look much different than the Velociraptor, a medium sized predator with large, sickle shaped toe claws, known from a few million years earlier in the late Cretaceous. According to Sues, another potential A. wyliei skeleton was discovered in the Hell Creek Formation last summer. And unlike the recently reconstructed Anzu skeleton, this one includes a foot, which could offer new details."}, {"title": "The World\u2019s Largest Virus Was Just Resurrected From 34,000-Year-Old Permafrost", "author": "Joseph Stromberg", "date": "March 3, 2014", "doc": "Deep within the Siberian permafrost, nearly 100 feet underneath the frozen ground, it sat\u00a0dormant, for centuries and centuries. Above ground, the glaciers receded, ancient humans arrived,\u00a0and eventually,\u00a0civilization developed. Now, its been thawed and revived, thanks to a team of French scientists. Its a virus, and its zombie like resurrection goes to show that the microbes can persist for far longer than scientists have previously imagined. For tens of thousands of years, the virus remained entirely frozen. The microbe, however, wasnt quite deadpartly because any virus, by the standards of biology, cant be truly be described as\u00a0alive. All viruses require host cells to reproduce, and in between reproductive cycles, they persist as an inert particle called a virion, roughly analogous to a plants seed. In 2000, the scientists, led by\u00a0Jean Michel Claverie\u00a0and\u00a0Chantal Abergel\u00a0of the\u00a0Mediterranean Institute of Microbiology, arrived in\u00a0Anyuysk, a remote town in Siberias Chukotka region, to search for new viruses in previously unexplored environments. Itd previously been speculated and has since been proven that organisms could be frozen for tens of thousands of years\u00a0and then successfully revived, so the researchers drilled deep into an outcrop of permanently frozen ground along the banks of the Anuy River to search for some. They handled the core of frozen soil they extracted\u00a0with extreme care, coating its outer surface with rubbing alcohol to eliminate contamination, then extracting a tiny sample of\u00a0soil from its center and storing it in a sterile bag. Using\u00a0radiocarbon dating, the scientists dated the soils age to somewhere between 34,000 and 37,000 years. Years passed, and the scientists eventually analyzed the sample, along with others. More than a decade later, theyve finally announced theyve indeed found a viable virus in the sample of permafrostand its much more unusual than theyd expected. We guessed that virions could remain infectious at least\u00a0that long, Claverie says.\u00a0The surprise came more from the fact that it was a giant virus and of a type totally different from the previous modern\u00a0ones. Until 2003, it was thought that all viruses were tinycompletely invisible under a standard light microscope\u00a0and a fraction of the size of most bacterial cells. Since, several giant viruses have been discovered, including pandoraviruses, discovered by Claverie and Abergel\u00a0in a water sample collected off the coast of Chile, which held the size record with a length of about one\u00a0micrometer, or one thousandth of a millimeter. But their new virus\u00a0Pithovirus sibericum, described in a paper published today in\u00a0Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,\u00a0is an astonishing 1.5\u00a0micrometers long,\u00a0between 10 and 100 times as large as the average sized virus. Under a microscope, its easily visible as an oval rimmed by a dark black envelope\u00a0with a perforated plug at the end, about the size of a bacterial cell. It poses no danger to humans, because it exclusively infects single celled organisms called\u00a0amoebaesomething the scientists discovered when they revived the microbe from its inert virion form by warming it up and\u00a0putting it in a petri dish with live amoebae. Once revived, the virus entered the amoebae cells,\u00a0hijacked the cells metabolic\u00a0machinery to create many copies of itself, and split the cells open, killing them and freeing itself\u00a0to infect further cells. Previously known giant viruses also infect amoebae, likely because of how easy it is to enter them. Amoebae feed through\u00a0phagocytosis, using their cellular membranes to engulf particles and organisms for a giant virus to get inside an amoeba, all it has to do it let itself be engulfed. Because\u00a0most human\u00a0and other animals cells dont engulf particles in this way, viruses that infect us generally have to use more complex entry methods, which prohibit such an enormous size. For the scientists, the most significant aspect of the new discovery is what they found when they isolated the virus DNA and sequenced its genes. Its genome size is much smaller than expected from the particle size,\u00a0only 500 genes, Claverie says, where the other two families of giant viruses have more than a thousand. Additionally, the new viruss replication process is much more similar to that of standard size virus, rather than the other giant viruses, leading Claverie to describe it as something of a bridge\u00a0between the\u00a0giant viruses and the traditional ones. Until now, the two families of giant virus discovered\u00a0megaviruses\u00a0and\u00a0pandoraviruses were very genetically similar. The discovery of a radically different giant virus in a randomly selected sample of permafrost, the researchers say, indicates that giant viruses are much more common and more diverse than was previously thought. Theres also the fact that this virus survived\u00a0for at least 30,000 years in frozen soil. Because viruses dont engage in most of the self sustaining activities performed by all forms of life they dont harness energy to\u00a0regulating their own metabolism, for instance, it seems likely that they can survive in an inert state far longer than any life form. If the only limit is the amount of time their DNA can persist, its possible they can survive several million years before its irreparably damaged by natural radioactivity from the Earth.\u00a0Claverie and Abergel are currently sampling older layers of frozen soil to search for even more ancient viruses. But even though this particular virus poses no human health threat, its discovery raises unsettling questions. This is a good demonstration that the notion that a virus could be eradicated\u00a0from the planet is plain wrong, and give us a false sense of security, Claverie says. As the Arctic and subarctic warm, mining and drilling mean\u00a0bringing human settlements and digging through these ancient layers for the first time in millions of years. If viable\u00a0virions are still there, this is a good recipe for disaster."}, {"title": "Scientists Solve the Mystery of a Nine-Million-Year-Old Mass Whale Die-Off", "author": "Joseph Stromberg", "date": "February 25, 2014", "doc": "Sometime between six and nine million years ago, in\u00a0a stretch of the Pacific Ocean just off of South America, something kept killing whales. Lots of them. At least thirty\u00a0baleen whales died, their bodies washed onto a tidal mudflat and buried over time. Species of sperm whale and a walrus like whale, both now extinct, also died, along with seals, billfishes, bony fish and aquatic sloths. These die offs, known as mass strandings, appeared to have happened over and over, with\u00a0the animals buried in sediment between each episode. Epochs passed. The skeletons, hidden underground, gradually fossilized. Geologic subduction\u00a0pushed the sediment upward by about 130 feet, lifting the mud flats and transforming them into dry land in whats\u00a0now known as\u00a0Chiles\u00a0Atacama Desert. Then, in October 2011, during the final moments of a paleontological expedition in the fossil rich region, Smithsonian researcher\u00a0Nick Pyenson\u00a0decided to look at the sediments being exposed by the widening of the Pan American Highway from two lanes to four right near the coast. Stumbling upon evidence of the deaths, he and his colleagues were astounded by what they sawdozens of complete, ancient\u00a0whale fossils, along with those of several other species, including\u00a0an extremely rare ancient dolphin species that had only been found a handful of times previously. At least ten different kinds of marine animals, recurring in four different layers, Pyenson says. It begged for an explanation. The problem The road would be widened within two months, and the fossils had to be removed immediately. This, of course, is a major\u00a0no no in paleontological research. Taking a fossil from its site\u00a0erases its geological context, the main clue Pyenson and other researchers could use in figuring out what caused all these deaths in the first place. The solution lasers. Soon after the discovery, Pyenson returned to the site with Vince Rossi and Adam Metallo of the\u00a0Smithsonian Digitization Program Office. Within a weeks time, they used\u00a0laser powered\u00a0digitization methods to\u00a0create digital 3D renderings of the site, and its fossils, in extreme detail. With these digital renderings, Pyenson and other researchers could inspect\u00a0the fossils in their original context at their leisure, even after theyd been removed. Digital models of the whales could also be shared electronically with other scientists, and the researchers eventually\u00a0made them publicly\u00a0available below a baleen whale fossil, along with a datasets of their\u00a0dimensions that allow anyone to print them at any scale. Over the next few years, Pyenson, Carolina Gustein of the\u00a0Universidad de Chile and other members of Pyensons Natural History Museum lab used the digital\u00a0models and the original fossils to investigate\u00a0the mystery of the site, called Cerro Ballena Spanish for whale hill. Analysis of the surrounding sediments showed they had been part of a tidal flat environment, and the\u00a0fossilsa broad mix of both\u00a0adult and juveniles of different specieswere deposited in four distinct layers over the course of about 16,000 years. Intriguingly, the fossils positions suggested they hadnt been killed at the site itself. The baleen whales were mostly belly up, and whales are generally only belly up if they arrive at someplace dead, Pyenson says. This is a graveyard, its not a murder sitethe murder happened elsewhere. He and colleagues investigated possible explanationsa tsunami, or a virusbut they didnt fit the data. There was no geologic evidence of a powerful tsunami, such as sand deposits where they shouldnt be, and the fossils were in excellent condition, relatively intact. Viruses and other pathogens tend to be species specific, making it unlikely theyd kill such a diversity of animals. I realized theres\u00a0only one good explanation for it harmful algal blooms, Pyenson says. As he and colleagues detail in\u00a0an article published today in\u00a0Proceedings of the Royal Society B, sudden blooms\u00a0of many types of algae\u00a0can produce high concentrations of toxins that\u00a0quickly kill\u00a0large herbivorous marine mammals when they inhale or eat them. Carnivorous animals, meanwhile, die after eating prey laced with them, causing organ failure. There are countless modern examples of algal blooms killing large marine animals, including a recent red tide off the\u00a0coast of Florida\u00a0that led to the deaths of thousands of manatees. The closest analog\u00a0for the Cerro Ballena die off may be a 1987 incident in which dozens of humpback whales washed ashore on Cape Cod, and\u00a0autopsies of dead whales showed theyd just eaten mackerel dense with red tide toxins. In modern times, algal blooms can be triggered by human activities fertilizer laced water runoff, for instance but also by the natural discharge of minerals such as iron into water, which feeds the explosive growth of algae. The Chilean coast nearby Cerro Ballena, as it happens, is chock full of iron deposits, and sudden rain in the arid region can carry it into the ocean via runoff. The researchers cant prove it definitely, but it seems most likely this mechanism is responsible for the bounty of whale fossils found during the widening of the highway. They also\u00a0plan to continue excavating in the area, with the hope of potentially finding evidence of other algae driven mass strandings that, Pyenson believes, likely happened elsewhere along the coast. They also hope to set an example. Theres a large industry of illegal fossil trafficking in the region, Pyenson says. A\u00a0lot of what our team is trying to do is legitimize scientific research in the eyes of the public. He adds, Fossils are non renewable resources, and the more that we can protect them, the more we can understand what they tell us about the past."}, {"title": "Colorful Plumage Began With Feathered Dinosaurs", "author": "Helen Thompson", "date": "February 13, 2014", "doc": "What color were the dinosaurs? Museums, movies, and paintings give us a vibrant picture of giant lizards in bright greens, yellows, purples, and blues. But, the truth is, dinosaur color is a bit of a mystery. Paleontologists like Julia Clarke of the University of Texas in Austin and others are trying to solve this mystery using the one of the most common natural color pigments\u00a0in the world melanin. In\u00a0a recent study\u00a0in\u00a0Nature, Clarke and her colleagues\u00a0suggest that feathered dinosaurs injected a range of colorat least color that comes from melanininto the ancient world. Researchers think that the appearance of this color variety in dino plumage was a side effect of a change in the way the ancient animals stored and used energy.\u00a0The\u00a0findings\u00a0have\u00a0implications for how paleontologists\u00a0reconstruct what these and other dinosaurs looked like.\u00a0 Melanin is responsible for darker skin coloration in humans, darker spots or stripes in lizards, and darker feather colors in birds. Tiny packages within our cells called\u00a0melanosomes\u00a0house melanin. In humans and birds, the shape of these melanosomes corresponds to different chemical\u00a0forms of melanin and thus, different colors.\u00a0For example,\u00a0red hues come from round melanosomes, and gray hues come from long and skinny melanosomes. Melanosomes come in a wide\u00a0variety of shapes and sizes, and those correspond to a wider variety of colors.\u00a0 The multishaped melanosomes found in birds led scientistsparticularly paleontologiststo wonder whether similar melanosomes are found in ancient birds and feathered dinosaurs, the ancestors of modern birds. Luckily, some fossil finds include fossilized feathers, and, with a high powered microscope, scientists can actually see melanosome structures preserved in these petrified plumages. Without a modern specimen to compare fossils to, scientists use the shapes of melanosomes in modern birds to give hints on what colors a particular feathered dinosaur or extinct bird might have sported. This is like a toolkit for us, explains Clark. Using this technique, Clarke and colleagues at the University of Akron in Ohio and Chinas University of Geosciences have linked the shapes of melanosomes in fossils to\u00a0red, gray, black, or iridescent hues in ancient fossilized birds and feathered dinosaurs. But Clarkes team knew that fossilized melanosomes had more to reveal. Scientists hadnt looked at melanin color in anything beyond a few mammals, birds, and feathered dinos, the researchers\u00a0wanted to see if melanosome shapes across the spectrum of the animal kingdom, extinct and living, could shed light on when the pigment packets shapes evolved to exhibit such variety. Pinpointing this timing would give them strong evidence for when dinosaurs evolved different colors. The team started off by sampling hair, skin, and feathers from 181 living mammals, turtles, lizards, crocodiles, and birds. In China, they examined fossils from 13 lizards, turtles, dinosaurs, and flying\u00a0reptiles called pterosaurs, all from from the Cretaceous and Jurassic periods, about 200 to 66 million years ago. The fossilized samples ranged from preserved feathers to patches of skin to fuzzy filaments from animals that sported spikes that were not quite feathers. The reasearchers then used a scanning electron microscope to visualize the melanosomes in these ancient structures. They looked at what type of body covering the\u00a0melanosomes from each sample extinct and living came fromskin, hair, fuzz, or feathersand measured\u00a0differences in their shapes across\u00a0different animal lineages\u00a0bird, mammal, and reptile. If you look at living lizards, turtles, and crocs theres a very small range in melanosome shapes, says Clarke. You might have very similar, only very subtly different shaped melanosomes in a brown versus a black versus a grey toned lizard. And, not much had changed in from ancient turtles and lizards to modern onesthe menalosomes in fossilized lizard and turtle remains also look too much alike and cant be used to predict what color the animals\u00a0might have been.\u00a0 However, feathered dinosaurs, specifically the first maniraptor dinosaurs which showed up on Earth about 150 million years ago and\u00a0ultimately became\u00a0birds, sported the greatest diversity of melanosome shapes. Interestingly, fuzzy dinosaursthose with spiky filaments and protofeathersevolutionarily preceded their\u00a0feathered brethren, but they\u00a0dont show melanosome shape diversity\u00a0either.\u00a0Only with the origin of feathers do you then see a huge explosion in diversity of melanosome shapes, says Clarke.\u00a0 An explosion in melanin\u00a0color diversity likely came with this range in melanosome shape. That doesnt mean\u00a0that ancient lizards, turtles, and dinosaurs with scales or just filaments\u00a0werent colorful. They may have simply relied on different pigments\u00a0for their color, Clark explains. Weirdly, mammal hair\u00a0and modern bird feathers\u00a0share this diversity in melanosome shape, despite the fact that they are totally unrelated animal families. On a molecular level, mammals and birds\u00a0even make melanin based colors in totally different ways. Nevertheless, it appears that they each independently\u00a0evolved this melanosome diversity. But, why would melanosomes evolve different shapes in feathered dinosaurs and not earlier? Clarke and colleages suggest that, in feathered dinosaurs at least, the variety of melanosome shapes may have something to do with the creatures physiology. For clues on what that something may be, Clarke draws again on the ancestral relationship between feathered dinosaurs and birds.\u00a0 Scientist have observed a genetic connection between how melanosomes are made and how birds regulate energyin particular, some genes that determine\u00a0melanosomes shape\u00a0are also involved in fat storage in chickens. Based on this, the researchers think that a genetic change related how feathered dinosaurs regulated energy in their bodies could have inadvertantly\u00a0caused a shift in how they made melanin. If true, this would be a good example of pleiotropy, where one\u00a0gene set can influence seemingly unrelated traits, a phenomenon thats pretty common in the biological world. For now, though, were one step closer to understanding the rules that govern a dinosaurs complextion."}, {"title": "Ancient Walking Fish May Have Walked on All Fours", "author": "Colin Schultz", "date": "January 14, 2014", "doc": "A full decade ago, paleontologists digging around in the Canadian High Arctic discovered something amazinga fish whose front fins seemed made for walking. The ancient fish, which lived 375 million years ago, looked a lot like a fish\u00a0and a bit like a crocodile\u00a0it had a flat, broad head, a long, slender body\u00a0and front fins that the researchers described as morphologically and functionally transitional between a fin and a limb. After analyzing the bones, the scientists, led by Neil Shubin,\u00a0suggested that the fish, Tiktaalik roseae, could prop itself up on its front fins to help it catch its prey in the river waters of what is now Canadas Ellesmere Island. When the first Tiktaalik roseae fossil was found in 2004, however, large parts of the organism were missing, including its hindquarters. But now, Shubin and his colleagues are back with a new Tiktaalik fossil. This time theyve got a preserved pelvis, and more surprises for the evolution of four legged propulsion. In addition to its limb like front fins, Tiktaalik also had large, mobile rear fins that it used to push itself around in the water. Postmedia News\u00a0Margaret Munro\u00a0reports that, according to the new study, the fishs pelvis was much bigger than expectedand indicates that Earths organisms may have started doing\u00a0something like walking on four legs much earlier than scientists had thought It looks like this shift actually began to happen in fish, not in limbed animals, team leader Neil Shubin, at the University of Chicago, says in a summary of the findings.... This is an amazing pelvis, particularly the hip socket, which is very different from anything that we knew of in the lineage leading up to limbed vertebrates, co author Edward Daeschler said in a summary of the findings. The finding that Tiktaalik had useful back limbs, too, certainly sounds like would have given the fish some advantages, says Jonathan Amos for the BBC The fins undoubtedly were employed as paddles to swim, but might also have been used in a leg like way on occasions. Tiktaalik probably had the ability to use those fins as props to move along, using them to push along the shallow bottom, to work its way through plants and, who knows, maybe it got out of the water briefly if it needed to move over to another watercourse, speculated Dr Daeschler. But in no way was it specialised for getting out of the water. It may have had some ability to do that, but everything about its reproduction, its sensory system, its hunting, its breathing   all these things tied it to the water, he told BBC News. Animals like Tiktaalik roseae can be tricky to think about, and its easy to misrepresent them as animals that so desperately wanted to walk on land. But, of course, says Berkeleys Understand Evolution,\u00a0thats not how evolution works Tiktaalik\u00a0was specialized for life in shallow water, propping itself up on the bottom and snapping up prey. The\u00a0adaptations\u00a0it had for this lifestyle ended up providing the stepping stones for vertebrates to climb onto dry land  but of course,\u00a0Tiktaalik\u00a0was not aiming to evolve features for land living.\u00a0Tiktaalik\u00a0was simply well adapted for its own lifestyle and later on, many of these features ended up being co opted for a new terrestrial lifestyle. There was already some contention over the timing of the arrival of four limbed motion, with some researchers in 2010 suggesting theyd found track marks from a four legged animal that predated even Tiktaalik.\u00a0But aside from that, the new discovery can help answer one of the persistent questions in evolution what good is half a leg?"}, {"title": "Dinosaur Poop Is Harder to Find Than It Should Be", "author": "Rose Eveleth", "date": "January 6, 2014", "doc": "At one point, there were a lot of dinosaurs roaming around the earth.

But considering just how many dinosaurs there were and how much poop they should have produced, some have wondered why there isnt more paleoscat around to study. Unlike today, where scavengers like dung beetles and flies break down feces, in the Mesozoic,\u00a0there were relatively few insects that could have done the dirty deed and done it on such a large scale.

Today scrubby bushes cover the bottom, where dirt paths wind past rainwater ponds filled with bright green algae. A gaping 200 foot deep gouge in the forested countryside, the Messel Pit doesnt at first glance seem worth preserving, never mind visiting, but since 1995 it has been a Unesco World Heritage site, thanks to a series of unfortunate events beginning some 48 million years ago. The world was a very different place then, during the period known to scientists as the Eocene. The levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were higher than today at least, for the time being, producing a greenhouse effect of soaring temperatures. In the Arctic, giant crocodilians swam in warm waters among the ferns. A tropical rainforest covered Antarctica. The shapes of the continents would be mostly recognizable, though India was still on the collision course with Asia that would form the Himalayas. Sea levels were about 150 feet higher than today, so Europe wasnt a largely continuous landmass but a vast archipelago. The spot now occupied by the new, conspicuously sleek, concrete and glass Messel Pit visitor centerwhich includes a trip back in time through a virtual boreholewas, in the Eocene, near a deep lake that at its peak was around two miles across. The lake became a deathtrap for countless animals, and geochemistry in concert with millions of years of accumulating plant and mineral sediments would preserve features of the sunken carcasses to an astonishing degree. Decaying animal and vegetable material buried and squeezed under tremendous pressure over millions of years yields, every school kid knows, fossil fuel, in this instance primarily oil shalelayers of soft gray stone impregnated with oil. Those deposits attracted miners from the late 1800s to the 1970s, when the open pit mine closed down and was forgotten by all but a small group of people bent on extracting not the fuel but the fossils. Word of amazing finds spread fast. And aside from a perhaps understandable bout of civic shortsightedness when the local government considered turning the giant hole in the ground into a garbage dumpa proposal that paleontologists and others sharply opposed for 20 years, prevailing in 1992the site has been cherished as the greatest fossil trove of its kind. Everyone in vertebrate paleontology knows Messel, says Johns Hopkins University paleontologist Ken Rose. Theres really no place in the world that compares. A great deal of what we know from that time period is from there. The Eocene, from 56 million to 34 million years ago, was a crucial turning point in the history of life on Earth, a time to which we ourselves owe a considerable debt, for thats when mammals came into their own and evolved to occupy the ecological niches vacated by the extinction of the dinosaurs. At Messel Pit, mammal skeletons galore are preserved intact, often with the outlines of fur and flesh still visible in the surrounding rock. Primitive opossums, horses the size of fox terriers, an anteater, eight bat species and a lemur like primate that could be an early branch on humanitys family treethese and many more fossils provide glimpses of the distant ancestors of species we know today. While paleontologists often frown at the prospect of visitors tromping around their digs, Messel Pit, which is run by the Senckenberg Research Institute in Frankfurt, is open to the public for guided tours. One fall day I follow geologist Marie Luise Frey from the 6.5 million visitor center, opened in 2010, to the bottom of the pit. She leads me off the paved path onto the gentle slope of a recently closed excavation. Flakes of dried out oil shale crunch under my boots. A sharp corner reveals where paleontologists cut through layers of shale with a chain saw, removing large blocks before carefully prying them apart to look for hidden fossils. The edges of the excavation resemble the pages of a burned book. Even today, the oil shale is mostly water. As it dries, Frey explains in German, the oil shale turns as flaky as phyllo dough and eventually crumbles to dust. Im trying to imagine the place as it was before, but the chill fall air, the turning leaves, the rumble of machinery at a nearby gravel plant arent helping me put myself in a jungle 48 million years ago. I notice some suspiciously round pebbles and pick one up. Its about the size of a praline. Das ist ein Koprolith, Frey tells me brightlya coprolite, paleontologist speak for a chunk of fossilized poop. This one was likely produced by a very big fish, she says You can still tell what they ate by examining them. I follow Frey farther into the pit, eager to understand how this place came to be. At some point around 50 million years ago, underground water came into contact with a vein of molten rock. High pressure steam erupted, forming a crater with steep sides. As water seeped in, it created a lake shaped more like a drinking glass than a soup bowl. Any animal that fell in sank quickly to the bottom. Still, that alone doesnt explain why so many land mammalsnot to mention birds, bats and insectsperished here. One theory is that carbon dioxide periodically bubbled up from deep beneath the lake bottom, smothering animals near the shore. Another possibility is that some of the summer algae blooms were toxic, poisoning animals that had chosen the wrong time and place to slake their thirst. Or perhaps smaller animals died nearby and were washed in by small floods or rushing streams. The lake was so deep that oxygen didnt circulate near the bottom, which meant that there were no bottom feeders around to consume the dead and dying animals. Year after year, algae scumming the lake surface bloomed and died, and so layers of fine clay and dead micro organisms drifted to the bottom. Each layer was as thick as a strand of hair. It took 250 years to build up an inch of mud. Over millions and millions of years, plants and animals were preserved like flowers pressed between the pages of a book, and the algae and other organic matter turned into oil shale. Among the thousands of fossils that paleontologists have recovered at Messel Pit are specimens representing nearly 45 different mammal species. Those finds are critical to understanding how warmblooded creatures evolved. Mammals and dinosaurs appeared at nearly the same time around 200 million years ago. But dinosaurs were so well suited to the environment that they crowded out any competition. Mammals lived on the margins, mostly tiny creatures eking out a living by eating insects under the cover of darkness. They just tried to stay out of the way, says Thomas Lehmann, a Senckenberg Research Institute paleontologist. And so it went for nearly 150 million years. Then, in an instant, everything changed, apparently when an asteroid or comet struck Earth 66 million years ago and dramatically altered the climate, eventually wiping out the giant reptiles. The diversity of species found among the Messel Pit fossils reveals that mammals rushed to fill every empty ecological nook and cranny they could find. They really tried everythingflying, jumping, running, tree dwelling, ant eating, says Lehmann. From the point of view of evolution, Messel is a fantastic laboratory to see what life might have given us. Might have, but in many cases didnt. Messels most fascinating specimens may be those species that have no living relatives, though they look jarringly familiar. In the visitor center, kids crowd around to watch as a conservator armed with toothbrushes, dental picks and scalpels cleans layers of oil shale away from a fossil unearthed just a few weeks earlier. To me, the skeleton of Ailuravus macrurus looks like that of a giant squirrel. Its three feet long, including its bushy tail. Near the ribs a black stain traces the creatures fossilized digestive tract. Despite its tail, Ailuravus is no squirrel ancestor. Its an evolutionary dead end Ailuravus and all of its relatives died out more than 37 million years ago. Why? Maybe they fell victim to climate changes, or a better adapted competitor, or disappearing food sources, or simple bad luck. Ailuravus resemblance to a modern squirrel is an example of evolutionary convergence. Given enough time, adaptations may lead to nearly identical solutionsbushy tails, say, or powerful, kangaroo like hind legspopping up in different species. Its like using the same Legos to build different forms, says Lehmann. And there are forms aplenty at the Messel Pit. The exquisitely preserved fossils have provided paleontologists with unprecedented insights into the adaptive strategies\u00adsome successful, others notadopted by mammals for feeding, movement and even reproduction. For instance, the contents of the tiny prehistoric horses stomachfossilized leaves and grape seedsindicate that the animal was not a grazer but a browser, eating what it found on the forest floor. The paleontologists also found eight fossilized specimens of pregnant mares, each carrying a single foal. That discovery suggests that the early horses had already adopted herd behavior, since joint care would be the best way to guarantee the survival of small numbers of offspring. Such findings make the place feel less like a graveyard than a time capsule encompassing a 48 million year old ecosystem. Its not only paleontology, its biology, says Jens Lorenz Franzen, a retired paleontologist who worked at the Senckenberg Research Institute and helped excavate some of Messels most remarkable finds. We can reconstruct the living world of that era."}, {"title": "Scientists Just Sequenced the DNA From A 400,000-Year-Old Early Human", "author": "Joseph Stromberg", "date": "December 4, 2013", "doc": "Since its discovery in 1990, La Sima de los Huesos, an underground cave in Northern Spains Atapuerca Mountains, has yielded more than 6,000 fossils from 28 individual ancient human ancestors, making it Europes most significant site for the study of ancient humans. But despite years of analysis, the exact age and even the species to which these individuals belonged has been in doubt. Now, though, an international group of scientists has extracted and sequenced DNA from the fossilized femur of one of these individuals for the first time. The resulting datawhich represent the oldest genetic material ever sequenced from a hominin, or ancient human ancestorfinally give us an idea of the age and lineage of these mysterious individuals, and its not what many scientists expected. The fossilized bone tested, a femur, is roughly 400,000 years old. But the big surprise is that, although scientists had previously believed the fossils belonged to Neanderthals because of their anatomical appearance, the DNA analysis actually shows theyre more closely related to Denisovans, a recently discovered third lineage of human ancestors known only from DNA\u00a0isolated from a few fossils found in Siberia in 2010. The findings, published today in\u00a0Nature, will force anthropologists to further reconsider how the Denisovans, Neanderthals and the direct ancestors of modern day humans fit together in a complicated family tree.  The femur from which DNA was extracted for analysis. Photo by\u00a0Javier Trueba, Madrid Scientific Films  The analysis was enabled by recent advances in methods for recovering ancient DNA fragments developed at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany, previously used to analyze the DNA of a cave bear fossil found in the same cave. This wouldnt have been possible just two years ago, says\u00a0Juan Luis Arsuaga, a paleontologist at the University of Madrid who led the initial excavations of the cave and collaborated on the new study. And even given these new methods, we still didnt expect these bones to preserve DNA, because theyre so oldten times older than some of the oldest Neanderthals from whom weve taken DNA. After extracting a two grams of crushed bone from the femur, a group of scientists led by Matthias Meyer isolated the mitochondrial DNA\u00a0mtDNA,\u00a0a pool of genetic material thats distinct from the DNA in the chromosomes located in our cells nuclei. Instead, this mtDNA lives in our cells\u00a0mitochondriamicroscopic organelles responsible for cellular respirationand is much shorter in length than nuclear DNA. Theres another quirk of mtDNA that makes it especially valuable as a means of studying the evolution of ancient humans Unlike your nuclear DNA, which is a mix of DNA from both your parents, your mtDNA comes solely from your mother, because most of a sperms mitochondria are found in its tail, which it sheds after fertilization. As a result, mtDNA is nearly identical from generation to generation, and a limited number of distinct sequences of mtDNA called haplogroups have been observed in both modern humans and ancient human ancestors. Unlike anatomical characteristics and nuclear DNA, which can vary within a group and make it difficult to confidently distinguish one from another, mtDNA is generally consistent, making it easier to link a particular specimen with a lineage. Which is why, when the researchers compared the femurs mtDNA to previously sequenced samples from Neanderthals,\u00a0from a Denisovan finger bone and tooth found in Siberia\u00a0and from many different modern humans, they found it so surprising that it more closely resembled the Denisovans. This was really unexpected, Arsuaga says. We had to think really hard to come up with a few scenarios that could potentially explain this. Anthropologists had already known that all three lineages humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans shared a common ancestor, but its far from clear how all three groups fit together, and the picture is further clouded by the fact that interbreeding may have occurred between them after they diverged. Helpfully, comparing the femurs mtDNA to the Neanderthal, Denisovan and modern human samples allowed the researchers to estimate its agebased upon known rates of mtDNA mutation, the previously established ages of the other samples, and the degree of difference between themleading to the 400,000 year figure. To explain how a Neanderthal looking individual could come to have Denisovan mtDNA during this time period, the scientists present several different hypothetical scenarios. Its possible, for instance, that the fossil in question belongs to a lineage that served as ancestors of both Neanderthals and Denisovans, or more likely, one that came after the split between the two groups estimated to be around 1 million years ago and was closely related to the latter but not the former. Its also a possibility that the femur belongs to a third, different group, and that its similarities to Denisovan mtDNA are explained by either interbreeding with the Denisovans or the existence of yet another hominin lineage that bred with both Denisovans and the\u00a0La Sima de los Huesos population and introduced the same mtDNA to both groups. If this sounds like a complicated family tree to you, youre not alone. This analysis, along with earlier work, adds further mystery to an already puzzling situation. Initial testing on the Denisovan finger bone found in Siberia, for instance, found that it shared mtDNA with modern humans living in New Guinea, but nowhere else. Meanwhile, it was previously thought that Neanderthals had settled in Europe and Denisovans further east, on the other side of the Ural Mountains. The new analysis complicates that idea. For now, the researchers believe the most plausible scenario illustrated below is the femur belongs to a lineage that split off from Denisovans sometime after they diverged from the common ancestor of both Neanderthals and modern humans. But perhaps the most exciting conclusion to come out of this work is that it proves that genetic material can survive for at least 400,000 years, and can be analyzed even after that amount of degradation. Armed with this knowledge and the new techniques, anthropologists can now attempt to genetically survey many other ancient specimens in hopes of better understanding our family tree.

They were creatures unlike anything I had ever seen, but their drab, scaly flesh was always fit snugly to their bones with little embellishment. For decades, this has been the paradox of prehistoric restorations. Reconstructed skeletons are gloriously magnificent and introduce us to strange creatures that we never could imagined if we did not already know they existed. Yet the art of reviving these organisms has often been incredibly conservative. Dinosaurs, in particular, have often been shrink wrappedtheir skin tightly pulled around a minimalist layer of muscle distributed over the skeleton. This may be part of why dinosaur restorations look so weird. As John Conway, C.M. Kosemen, Darren Naish and Scott Harman argue in their new book All Yesterdays, no living lizard, fish, bird or mammal adheres to such a limited skin on the bones fashion. Dinosaurs were not only skeletally distinctive, but they undoubtedly looked stranger and behaved more bizarrely than we have ever imagined. The recently published Dinosaur Art started to realize these possibilities, but All Yesterdays goes even further in melding science and speculation about dinosaur biology. On a superficial level, All Yesterdays is a gorgeous collection of speculative artwork. Divided into two sectionsthe first featuring Mesozoic life in new or little seen vignettes, and the second imagining how we would restore modern animals if we only had partial skeletons to work fromthe book features some of the most wonderful paleoart Ive ever seen. Scott Hartmans crisp skeletal reconstructions form the framework from which Conway and Kosemen play with muscle, fat and flesh, and, following Naishs introductory comments, Kosemen provides scientific commentary about how each illustration is not quite so outlandish as it seems. A curious Camptosaurus approaching an Allosaurus at rest is a reminder that, much like modern animals, prey and predators were not constantly grappling with each other, just as a snoozing rendition of the Tyrannosaurus Stan shows that even the scariest dinosaurs had to snooze. The gallerys feathered dinosaurs are especially effective at demonstrating the fluffy weirdness of the Mesozoic. Conways peaceful scene of feather draped Therizinosaurus browsing in a tree grove is the best rendition of the giant herbivore Ive ever seen, and his fluffy, snowbound Leaellynasaura are unabashedly adorable. The second half of the book continues the same theme, but in reverse. How would artists draw a cat, an elephant or a baboon if we only had skeletons or bone fragments? And what would those scraps suggest about the biology of long lost animals? If there are paleontologists in the future, and they have no other source of information about our world, how will they restore the animals alive today? They might have no knowledge of the fur, fat, feathers and other structures that flesh out modern species, creating demonic visions of reptilian cats, eel like whales and vampire hummingbirds. Working in concert, the two sections will give casual readers and paleoartists a jolt. While some might gripe about Todd Marshall adding too many spikes and dewlaps to his dinosaurs, or Luis Rey envisioning deinonychosaurs at play, the fact of the matter is that dinosaurs probably had an array of soft tissue structures that made them look far stranger than the toned down restorations were used to. As All Yesterdays presents in various scenes, maybe sauropods liked to play in the mud, perhaps hadrosaurs were chubbier than we ever imagined and, as depicted in one nightmare inducing panel, Stegosaurus could have had monstrous genitals. None of these scenarios are supported by direct evidence, but they are all within the realm of possibility. More than a gallery of speculative art, All Yesterdays is an essential, inspirational guide to any aspiring paleoartist. Those who restore prehistoric life are limited by the evidence at hand, this is true, but more conservative does not mean more accurate. Using comparisons with modern animals, artists have far more leeway than they have ever exercised in imagining what prehistoric life was like. Weve seen enough Deinonychus packs tearing apart Tenontosaurus, and far too many malnourished dinosaurs. We need more fat, feathers, accessory adornments and scenes from quieter moments in dinosaur lives that do not involve blood and spilled viscera. Professional paleoartists are beginning to embrace these ideasJason Broughams recent restoration of Microraptor is an appropriately fluffy, bird like animal rather than the flying monster Naish and collaborators decrybut All Yesterdays is a concentrated dose of prehistoric possibilities that are being artistically explored. Some of the books restorations may turn out to look quite silly. As lovely as Conways rendition is, I still dont buy the bison back idea for high spined dinosaurs such as Ouranosaurus. Then again, depending on what we discover in the future, some of the illustrations might seem quite prescient. The important thing is that All Yesterdays demonstrates how to push the boundaries of what we imagine while still drawing on scientific evidence. The book is a rare treat in that each section explicitly lays the inspiration for each speculative vision, providing references for those who want to dig deeper. If anything, All Yesterdays shows that we should not be afraid of imagination in science. Even though we know far more about dinosaur biology and anatomy than ever before, there are still substantial gaps in our understanding. In these places, where bones might not have much to tell us, science meets speculation. The result is not anything goes garishness, but an exploration of possibilities. Somewhere within that murky range of alternatives, we may start to approach what dinosaurs were truly like.

The park boasts one of the largest displays of dinosaur tracks in the world. In 1966 a bulldozer operator discovered the first of the footprints in a slab of gray sandstone. The construction project was sidelined and further excavations at the site revealed a swath of 2,000 footprints. About 1,500 of the tracks were reburied so that they might be preserved, while 500 remain visible, protected by a geodesic dome built in 1977. Paleontologists surmise that 200 million years ago, in the early Jurassic period, a dinosaur called Dilophosaurus made the tracks, which measure 10 to 16 inches in length and are spaced 3.5 to 4.5 feet apart. When I was first there I was probably about 9 years old, says Carrano. It was just very dramatic. The footprints are on the spot where the dinosaur stepped. They are still there. Seeing them was almost more like being close to the living animal. Footprints capture action in the fossil record. The unusual thing about dinosaurs is that most begin as two legged animals. In the modern world, there are just very few things that walk on two legs, says Carrano. The tracks at the edge of what was once an ancient lake date to the early history of dinosaurs, so they show how dinosaurs were moving and taking advantage of that adaptation. You can see that some of them in areas where the lake was deeper were kind of swimming. In some places, they would sit down, and you can see there is a little butt print of a dinosaur, says Carrano. It is a very evocative place. A visit to Dinosaur State Park, he adds, emphasizes the evolution that the landscape has undergone. You walk out of the building, and you are in Connecticut in 2011. You walk in the building, and you are in Connecticut 200 million years ago. So it is like time travel, without going anywhere, says Carrano. You can get a sense of how this place was different. Nothing has moved. But everything has changed. To help in that regard, the park has an Arboretum of Evolution on its grounds with more than 250 plant species, all members of plant families that thrived during the reign of the dinosaurs. Bucket List Carrano picks some must see sites he hopes to visit one day Dinosaur Valley State Park\nGlen Rose, Texas\nhttpwww.tpwd.state.tx.uspublicationsparkguidergnpl019.phtml Dinosaur footprints have been found in almost every country, but the really cool ones are ones that have become famous for showing something specific, says Carrano. At Dinosaur Valley State Park, about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth, scientists found a 113 million year old trackway showing a 40 foot long theropod, a bipedal carnivore, stalking its prey, a 60 foot long herbivorous sauropod. Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry\nElmo, Utah\nhttpwww.blm.govutstenfopricerecreationquarry.html Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, in central Utah, is basically a giant trap filled with dinosaur bones, says Carrano    more than 12,000 bones, in fact. In the past century, researchers have found specimens of more than 70 dinosaurs, mostly the meat eating species Allosaurus, at the quarry, making it the densest deposit of Jurassic dinosaur bones in the world. It has been a big debate about why they are all there, says Carrano. Did the dinosaurs get mired in a muddy bog? Did they drink contaminated water? Paleontologists have also theorized that the dinosaurs died of thirst near an evaporating water hole, drowned in a flood or perished and washed up on a sandbar in a riverbed. In a building constructed over a portion of the quarry, visitors can see the pile of dinosaur bones. I have always wanted to see that, says Carrano. Chances are, he adds, If you go to a museum and see an Allosaurus, you probably are seeing one from this quarry. More than 60 museums around the world display skeletons unearthed from the site Matthew Carrano of the National Museum of Natural History studies the evolutionary history of predatory dinosaurs. He excavates fossils from field sites in Wyoming and Montana, Chile, Madagascar and Zimbabwe. He also analyzes bones already in museum collections. His goal is to trace which dinosaur species evolved from which other species, from their rise in the Triassic period to their extinction 160 million years later in the Cretaceous. Did animals get bigger or smaller? Did they start in one place and move to another? says Carrano. To answer any sort of evolutionary question, you need this family tree to start."}, {"title": "Wyoming Paleontology Dispatch #9: Why It\u2019s Called \u201cBreaking Camp\u201d", "author": "Scott L. Wing", "date": "August 25, 2011", "doc": "My least favorite day of the year has arrived. Yesterday we completed one last hike prospecting the badland hills north of Worland where rocks deposited during the PETM are exposed. The search was fruitlesswe found no new plant fossil sites, no last day of the field season wonders. Today is the day we break camp, pack everything back into the little red shed at the Bureau of Land Management yard, and leave. Breaking camp, striking camp, anyway you put it, taking down the tents we have lived in for the past month always makes me feel sad. It is strange, but I think most people feel itone becomes emotionally attached to a spot of ground very quickly. We arrived here just a month ago. This was, and soon again will be, a bare patch of relatively flat ground dotted with sagebrush and cactus. We set up a tent for cooking, a few more tents for sleeping. Each day we woke here, breakfasted here, left for work from here, returned here in the evening, ate again, and sat here and talked as the sky overhead of this spot darkened and broke out in stars. Our only commitments to this place are our temporary use of it, the temporary structures we brought with us, and a ring of stones we made to contain the occasional campfire. Yet through some trick of the human psyche it feels like home. Taking down the tents and packing them into Dino destroys the home we have made our own simply through living in it and enjoying it for a few weeks. No wonder the term is breaking camp. Of course there are other reasons to feel a little melancholy as we pull the tent stakes, fold the tarps, pack the bins of dishes, and empty the coolers of their last blocks of ice. We are all giving up the fellowship that grows among any small group that lives and works together in a challenging environment, even for a short time. I have seen this happen, field season after field season, for nearly 40 years now. Some groups mesh exceptionally well, with others there is more friction, but always people learn to help one another to some degree. They come to feel a common purpose. And almost always they feel a connection to this harsh landscape, even a little sense of owning the place by virtue of living in it. We will also miss the relative independence that comes with fieldworkwe have had stretches of several days when we were unplugged from the world, with no phone or email. Until about 10 years ago our only non emergency contact with the rest of the world was via snail mail and weekly phone calls that could be placed from a public pay phone in Worland. Now, improved cell phone coverage has turned the hill behind camp into the phone booth, and it takes a conscious decision to separate from the rest of the world. The reward of separating is to be, temporarily, master of your own schedule and captain of your activities, able to focus entire days on the rocks and fossils in front of you without even the shadow of distraction by the outside world. It seems a radical act, and it is almost as addictive as collecting fossils. Finally and most importantly, although fieldwork is physically hard and frequently monotonous, it also holds the possibility of great finds. In leaving I am giving up the chance that tomorrow I might walk around a nameless badland hill and find a spectacular new fossil site. The gambler in me wants to throw the dice a few more times. That is my main motivation for returning to the Bighorn Basin every summer. Some 20 years ago my colleague Bill DiMichele came to visit one of my field areas in the Bighorn BasinI think curious that I continued to come back here year after year. One evening after dinner we walked to the top of a high butte near my camp and looked out onto an area of badlands called The Honeycombs, maybe 10 square miles of sharply weathered badland hills, each isolated from the next by ravines 50 to 100 feet deep, and each exposing on its sides rocks deposited in the last part of the Paleocene. Bill said what we were both thinking My God, youll never look at all that, its an endless labyrinth of outcrop just in this little area. He was certainly right, but it remains fun to try. We started packing not long after dawn so that we could complete the hardest work before it got hot, and by 10 a.m. our home is entirely packed and loaded into Dino. My poor old field vehicle is once again bulging at the doors. We take a last tour around our campsite, picking up the occasional small pieces of paper or plastic that have blown into the surrounding sage during summer windstorms. We all want to leave it as we found it, even if we dont want to leave it at all. When we finish, the site is a barren, dusty, sage spotted flat looking pretty much as it did when we got here. The fire ring, and a few smooth spots where tents were pitched are the only marks we have left. Dinos creaks and groans are louder than ever as I negotiate the camp road for a final time. Topping the first low hill outside of camp there is a large buck pronghorn standing by the two track, grazing placidly. He looks up with mild interest as we pass, far more blas\u00e9 than the usual pronghorn as we rattle by about 40 feet away. I like to imagine that he is patiently waiting for the summer people to leave and return the badlands to their regular state of sun stunned, midday quietude. With any luck, though, we will be back in his territory next year. Who knows what we might find then? \u00ab Dispatch 8 Scott Wing is a research scientist and curator in the Smithsonian Institutions Department of Paleobiology."}, {"title": "When Triceratops Was a Giant Bison", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "May 27, 2011", "doc": "Triceratopsthe giant with a three horned faceis one of the great ambassadors for dinosaurs. Everyone knows this well ornamented Cretaceous herbivore today, but the dinosaur was originally mistaken for a very different creature. For a short time, the horns of Triceratops were thought to belong to a giant bison. Near the close of the 19th century, relatively little was known about the dinosaurs of North America or, in fact, dinosaurs in general. The word dinosaur had been coined by the English anatomist Richard Owen in 1842, and the entire group was only represented by a handful of species known from specimens of varying completeness. The extraordinary fossil rich formations of the American West had just begun to be examined, meaning each discovery had the potential to significantly change the image of prehistoric life. The early Triceratops fossil was one such discovery. The story of the fossilincluding its changing attributionwas retold by paleontologist Ken Carpenter in a 2007 paper in the book Horns and Beaks. The tale of the specimen began in the rock around Denver, Colorado. This area was peppered with fossils from the last days of the dinosaurs and the earliest days of the post dinosaur world, and the fossils were so accessible that many were picked up by local collectors and those in want of natural curiosities to display at home. But the Triceratops fossil had a different fate. In the spring of 1887, a local high school teacher and geologist by the name of George Cannon found two large horns and part of a skull roof. The specimen was sent to Othniel Charles Marsh at Yale University, and after urging his contacts in the field that he wanted more of the skull, a few more fragments of the horns soon followed. Altogether, the fossil consisted of a pair of long horns attached to part of the skull roof, and it had clearly belonged to some prehistoric animal much larger than anything that roamed the West in modern times. Anatomically speaking, the horns most closely resembled those of herbivorous, horn bearing mammals like bison. In fact, the horns looked as if they had come from some gigantic predecessor of that iconic Western symbol, and therefore Marsh named this new creature Bison alticornis that same year. Those who know the rocks from which the bones came were not so sure. Cannon, who had found other dinosaur fossils in the same rock layers, found it strange that the remains of a giant bison should be found mixed in with those of dinosaurs, and he wrote to Marsh that he would devote every spare second to figuring out why such disparate organisms should be found in the same strata. Marsh eventually recognized the Denver horns as belonging to a horned dinosaur, but his path to this conclusion was circuitous. For example, in 1888 Marsh named the dinosaur Ceratops on the basis of similar, smaller horns that had been sent to him, but the Yale paleontologist initially thought the horns were spikes akin to those anchored in the tail of Stegosaurus. Another dinosaur that Marsh changed his mind about multiple times. Marsh changed his stance again after receiving the partial skull of the dinosaur that he would name Triceratops horridus in 1889 the long, pointed structures were horns peculiar to this previously unrecognized group of dinosaurs, and further discoveries of horned dinosaurs reinforced this view. Marshs nemesis, Edward Drinker Cope, had studied a number of horned dinosaur specimens during the 1870s, but he was also left puzzled by the horn cores and other incomplete remains from the ceratopsians. Still, to cover his mistake, Marsh affirmed that the structure of the Denver horns truly was similar to that of a bison. This isnt so far fetched. The horn structures of Triceratops and bison are somewhat similar, and paleontologist Tobin Hieronymus and colleagues recently used the horn anatomy of buffalo and musk oxen to reconstruct the facial structures of the horned dinosaur Pachyrhinosaurus. As Carpenter cautions, though, we should not ridicule Marsh for his mistakes. No one in the late 1880s knew what a ceratopsian really looked like, especially since many of the dinosaurs that Marsh had previously studied were Jurassic creatures that lived many millions of years before. With nothing else for comparison, the Triceratops horns did show some features in common with both bison horns and Stegosaurus spikes, which led Marsh to incorrect conclusions until more complete specimens finally solved the mystery. Marshs mistakes are a prime example of how new dinosaurs are sometimes identifiedparts of unknown creatures are compared to what is already known in an attempt to narrow down a range of possibilities for identification. Triceratops was so different from other dinosaurs Marsh studied that it is little wonder that he erred in his conclusions.

No major institution can be without a hall of enormous Jurassic and Cretaceous animals with the smaller, lesser known Triassic dinosaurs taking their places along the margins, but the American occupation with the biggest and baddest Mesozoic creatures is relatively new. Even though dinosaurs captured the publics imagination relatively early on appearing in cartoons, poetry and other bits of pop culture in the 1820sthey were still almost entirely absent from American museums at the close of the 19th century. Even at the height of the infamous Bone Wars between the academics O.C. Marsh and E.D. Cope, public museum displays typically boasted little more than a few teeth and a limb bone or two. As historian and paleontologist Paul Brinkman illustrates in his new book, The Second Jurassic Dinosaur Rush, todays spectacular dinosaur displays have their roots in the turn of the 20th century contest to see who could obtain the most impressive sauropod dinosaur. The American Museum of Natural History, the Carnegie Museum and the Field Museum competed to find the most complete Jurassic dinosaur specimens possible skeletons that are still prominently on display in each institution to this day, yet this second dinosaur rush was a bit different from the rough and tumble expeditions of Cope and Marsh. Rather than actively try to savage one anothers reputation, teams from each of the institutions tried to lure away members of opposing groups and kept a watchful eye on what their competitors were doing, with whatever controversies erupted being a result of museum politics instead of Wild West antics. They did not always get along, but they had common goals, and so many of the paleontologists working at that time hated Marsh that each team was trying to find its own way of showing that Americas former leading paleontologist was not as brilliant as he thought he was. Much of Brinkmans book records the movements and activities of the paleontologists employed by the various museums as they scouted Jurassic age dinosaur sites in the American West. There are quite a few famous names to keep track of H.F. Osborn, John Bell Hatcher, William Diller Matthew, Barnum Brown, Elmer Riggs, Olaf Peterson, J.L. Wortman and othersand a number of them switched institutions during the period in question. At times it is easy to get confused about who was working for whom, but this is less the fault of Brinkmans clear prose than of the politics and dealings of early 20th century paleontologists. Although I would have preferred a little more analysis of how discoveries in the field were translated into academic and popular images of dinosaurssomething discussed primarily in the conclusion, in relation to the role of paleontology in large museumsBrinkmans work fills in a considerable gap in our understanding of the history of paleontology. Every paleontologist worth his or her salt is familiar with the names Osborn, Hatcher, Riggs and the like, but few have paid much attention to the details of how these researchers collected specimens and kept paleontology thriving during a time when their discipline was being superseded by genetics and other biological sciences in universities. Had large museums not been so interested in fostering their paleontology programsprograms with great potential to collect specimens that would bring in hordes of patronsthe science may very well have stagnated. Although paleontologists sometimes found themselves caught up in red tape or working for finicky institutional administrators, both museums and paleontology benefited from the close collaboration. If I have any significant criticism of Brinkmans work, it is that the book should have included a glossary or appendix explaining the present nomenclature for many of the dinosaurs discussed in the book. Frequent references are made to the sauropod Morosaurus, for example, which was considered a valid name at the turn of the 20th century but has since been synonymized with Camarasaurus. Those steeped in the esoterica of dinosaur paleontology will have no problem with such details, but other readers may be puzzled to see so many unfamiliar dinosaur names. \u200bThere are a few major gaps in the history of paleontology that, for one reason or another, have not yet merited a major investigation. Brinkmans The Second Jurassic Dinosaur Rush has now filled in one of those gaps in a comprehensive and accessible manner. From daily camp life to museum politics, Brinkman has ably documented a time of major change in dinosaur science, one that provides the context for paleontology as we know it today."}, {"title": "Twenty Years of Tyrannosaurus Sue", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "August 12, 2010", "doc": "Twenty years ago today, fossil hunter Sue Hendrickson discovered the dinosaur that now bears her namethe immense, 80 percent complete Tyrannosaurus rex called Sue. Arguably the most famous representative of the superstar of the dinosaur world, Sue is one of the most fantastic fossil discoveries ever made, yet the story of the discover underscores persistent problems that still confound paleontologists. The route Sues skeleton took from the Cretaceous age rock of South Dakota to Chicagos Field Museum was circuitous. Soon after researchers from the privately owned Black Hills Institute removed the bones from the encasing rock, a dispute arose over who owned the land where Sue was found and who had the rights to the skeleton. The Black Hills Institute crew had paid Maurice Williams, the putative landowner, 5,000 Williams later contended that this fee was only for access to his land and that the skeleton was his. Since he was a member of the Sioux Nation, the tribe also became involved in the dispute. Tyrannosaurus Sue quickly took on a distressing new meaning as the parties jockeyed for ownership. As it turned out, the land Sue was found on was being held in trust by the Department of the Interior, and in 1992 the FBI and National Guard raided the Black Hills Institute to seize Sue. Eventually, a trial judge awarded Sue to Williams. Then Williams decided to auction the skeleton to the highest bidder through Sothebys, and the event was set for October 4, 1997. Many paleontologists feared that Sue would wind up with a private collector, never to be seen againbut a partnership between a museum and several corporations secured the fossil for public display. While the bones would ultimately come to rest at Chicagos Field Museum, the institution needed the help of Disney, McDonalds and other donors to reach the winning 7.6 million bid for the most complete Tyrannosaurus rex ever found. Many of the problems that delayed Sues journey to the Field Museum and into the scientific literature remain. Land ownership is still a major concern for scientists and fossil collectors, especially when something agreed upon over a handshake goes sour. Paleontologists must check and double check the provenance of the bones they are recovering so they can protect themselves and the dinosaurs they find. Auctions and the fossil black market continue to do brisk business. All too often, exceptional specimens go from the ground into private hands and never receive the scientific study they deserve. The fact that Sue sold for nearly eight million dollars only made things worse, as it confirmed that underground fossil dealers could command hefty sums for museum  or university worthy specimens. This issue came to the fore again last year when it became known that paleontologist Jorn Hurum and the University of Oslo paid almost 750,000 for an exquisitely preserved fossil primate named Darwinius. There are a few cases in which owners of purchased specimens do the right thinglike when the owner of the first known Raptorex skeleton, Henry Kriegstein, donated it to a museum in Inner Mongolia, where it had been illegally excavatedbut for every act of generosity there are innumerable instances where money wins out. Indeed, in especially remote places, fossils are often yanked out from under paleontologists noses and wind up in a wealthy buyers showroom. Aside from such controversies, Sue has provided paleontologists with a wealth of information about Tyrannosaurus rex. Just do a literature search for Sues official institutional identificationFMNH PR 2081and you will find a stream of papers on subjects ranging from the animals arm and neck biomechanics to how the gigantic theropod grew as it aged. Sue has been a boon to researchers, and no doubt will remain so."}, {"title": "How Dryptosaurus Got Its Name", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "April 19, 2010", "doc": "In 1866, back when the scientific study of dinosaurs was only just beginning in North America, the naturalist E.D. Cope received word that workers at the West Jersey Marl Company in Gloucester County, New Jersey, had discovered the gigantic bones of an unknown fossil animal. As Cope did much of his work just across the Delaware River in Philadelphia, he did not have far to travel, and upon arriving at the site he was able to collect elements of the jaws, skull, legs, hip, tail and arm including an immense claw from the chocolate colored Cretaceous marl. Altogether this material would come to represent a dinosaur Cope named Laelaps aquilunguis, named after the dog of Greek mythology which never failed to catch its prey Laelaps and for the large talon found among the remains aquilunguis, meaning eagle clawed. As he declared in its description, Cope believed it was the most formidable type of rapacious terrestrial vertebrata of which we have any knowledge. Cope was enthralled by this discovery. It was the first partial skeleton of a predatory dinosaur found in the United States, and the fact that its arms were clearly shorter than its hindlimbs caused paleontologists to reconsider what dinosaurs looked like. Rather than being the squat, crocodile like monsters that the English anatomist Richard Owen envisioned, dinosaurs were cast as being more bird like in form and habit, and in his scientific work Cope himself appears to have taken great joy in envisioned Laelaps leaping upon its prey, tearing at the hide of Hadrosaurus also discovered in New Jersey and shattering the armor of ancient crocodiles. Today we know the dinosaur as a tyrannosauroid closely related to the recently discovered Appalachiosaurus, and though hypotheses of what it looked like have changed a bit since the late 19th century Copes restorations of Laelaps was still pretty close to reality. Yet Laelaps was not to keep its name. Unbeknown to Cope, that genus name had already been applied to a kind of mite, and this provided an opportunity for his rival, O.C. Marsh, to upstage him. Though they struck up a brief friendship upon meeting in Europe early in their career, back in the United States the two paleontologists quickly became fierce rivals, and the competition between them erupted into the famous Bone Wars of the late 19th century. Both in the field and in academic journals, both men vied for the unofficial title of Americas greatest paleontologist, and in the case of New Jerseys predatory dinosaur Marsh had found a way to rename one of Copes most favorite discoveries. In 1877, eleven years after it was first announced, Marsh renamed Copes dinosaur Dryptosaurus tearing reptile in a footnote of a description of another dinosaur, Titanosaurus which, oddly enough, had already been used for another dinosaur, causing Marsh to later rename it Atlantosaurus. This must have been doubly frustrating for Cope. Not only had his Laelaps been renamed, but his rival had done so as an academic aside. While it is certainly true that the methods of writing scientific papers and descriptions have changed since 1877, I cant help but wonder if Marsh intentionally renamed Laelaps in a footnote specifically to irk Cope. Not surprisingly given his stubborn temperament, Cope continued to use the name Laelaps for the rest of his career. This was not the only time that a prehistoric creature had to be renamed because the name it had been given was preoccupied. Another fossil creature from New Jersey, a crocodile originally named Holops, had to have its name changed to Holopsisuchus because its original name had already been given to an insect. Even more recently, it was discovered that the horned dinosaurs Diceratops and Microceratops needed to be renamed for much the same reason. Today they are known as Diceratus and Microceratus, respectively. Such conflicts are inevitable, especially as biologists of varying fields continue to catalog new genera, and while I must admit I like some of the original genus names, we all have to play by the rules when it comes to science."}, {"title": "Uncovering Seitaad: An Interview With Mark Loewen", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "March 26, 2010", "doc": "Earlier this week I reported on the discovery of a new, 190 million year old sauropodomorph dinosaur Seitaad ruessi from southern Utah, and scientist Mark Loewen of the Utah Museum of Natural History one of the paleontologists who described the fossil was kind enough to answer a few of my questions about it. Brian How was the skeleton discovered, and when did you realize it was a new kind of dinosaur? Mark Seitaad was discovered by Joe Pachak, a local historian, sculptor and petroglyph expert from Bluff, Utah. Joe was hiking the Navajo Sandstone on Comb Ridge in the four corners region of Utah, came across the bones, and alerted both the BLM and the Utah Museum of Natural History. We received photographs in February of 2005 showing a skeleton in the side of a cliff. When we recognized the rocks in the photos as likely Navajo, we got really excited.\u00a0 So little is known of the Navajo Sandstone fauna that we suspected anything we might find would be significant and probably new. When we first excavated the skeleton we mistakenly thought we had a pterosaur, with the eroded ischium being the lower jaw. As we started to prep the blocks we recognized we had it 180\u00b0 backwards and were leaning toward it being a theropod. As we prepped down to shoulders and arms we knew we had a prosauropod. Joe Sertich and I borrowed the scant materials from this group that were previously found in the Navajo Sandstone of Arizona from\u00a0 Museum of Northern Arizona and the UCMP at Berkeley and saw right away that we had something new. After comparing our specimen to all other known basal sauropodomorphs, we confirmed that we had something new to science. Brian The head, neck, and tail of Seitaad were missing. What could have happened to them? Mark As we completed the preparation we were able to determine that Seitaad was deposited literally standing on its head in a nearly vertical position. The skeleton was preserved with just the backbone emerging from the cliff wall. Every other bone head, neck, pelvis, femora, and tail would have been eroded away when the modern canyon formed. The sand immediately surrounding the fossil are consistent with dune collapse deposits and are laterally equivalent dune foresets. Similar isolated collapse deposits are repeated above in the cliff wall. Rapid burial by rare sedimentary event is the likely scenario in which the skeleton was preserved.\u00a0\u00a0 It wasnt until a year ago when we CT scanned the block at the University of Utah Hospital that we realized that Seitaad was missing a single toe and the fibula. Seitaad was probably recently dead and complete when it was buried and was held together by soft tissues. Brian For most of the public, the process by which dinosaurs are named is mysterious. How did Seitaad ruessi get its unusual name? Mark We wanted a unique name for the skeleton in a local dialect and settled on the rich traditions of the Navajo language. We found a Navajo Din\u00e9 creation legend about Seitaad, a sand desert monster that swallowed its victims in sand dunes. The fossilized skeleton of Seitaad was swallowed by a sand dune, so it seemed appropriate. The suffix ruessi is derived from Everett Ruess, a famous young philosopher poet, artist, historian, explorer and lover of the red rock country of southern Utah where he was last seen in 1934. We wanted to honor Everett Ruess for his love of the region, its people, and for his free spirited and adventurous lifestyle. Brian As described in the paper, Seitaad is a sauropodomorph dinosaur. How did it and its extinct relatives relate to the later, long necked sauropod dinosaurs? Mark Seitaad is a basal member of the clade Sauropodomorpha. Many of these basal forms have in the past formed a clade that we knew as prosauropods. Recent work has suggested that prosauropods do not form a group of their own, an idea we will further be able to test as we find more animals like Seitaad. The phylogenetic analyses we ran suggests Seitaad is a close relative of the prosauropods Plateosaurus from Germany and Riojasaurus and Adeopapposaurus from Argentina. Either way, Seitaad is now the best known, early sauropodomorph from western North America and is closely related to the animals we think of when we say prosauropod. The last survivors of the sauropodomorphs the long necked sauropods probably evolved large body size as super food processing strategy and or to deter predators. Seitaad represents the standard run of the mill basal sauropodomorph in terms of size. Interestingly, large true sauropods had evolved in other parts of the world by the time Seitaad was living in Utah. Brian What kind of environment did Seitaad live in? What other creatures did it live alongside? Mark Seitaad lived in a vast white desert. The backdrop would have been crescent shaped barchan dunes of white sand stretching as far as the eye could see. There were wetter areas with vegetation and interdunal ponds between some of the dunes. Most of the vegetation would have been plants like horsetails and ferns. According to work by David Loope, monsoonal rains from the summer northeasterlies would have produced periodic dune slumps and collapses. Not a very hospitable environment From fossils we know that there was a protomammal tritylodont living in the Navajo along with one or two crocodylomorphs. We have a single specimen of the small theropod dinosaur Segisaurus halli along with trackway evidence of a 20 feet long theropod probably similar to Dilophosaurus. Other than that, we know from tracks that there was a small ornithopod and can presume that pterosaurs flew in the skies above. Seitaad was by far the largest herbivore in the area, a fact confirmed by trackway evidence. Brian And, to conclude on a more personal note, what inspired you to pursue paleontology as a career? Mark Like most kids I always loved dinosaurs. I got into science in college as a chemistry major and really took a liking to solving research problems. I was lucky enough to land a summer research internship looking for fossils in the Eocene of Wyoming and immediately switched to geology and paleontology. During graduate school, I started to see both sedimentology and paleontology as a way to travel back in time and see the past. I am personally fascinated in past worlds and what the animals that lived in them were like.

Even though innumerable museums have dinosaur exhibits and filmmakers are almost constantly calling paleontologists to appear on television documentaries, it is extremely difficult for researchers to find jobs and secure funding for their research. Indeed, there is much more to paleontology than simply finding fossils, and in the latest issue of American Paleontologist, Peter Dodson asks the question Who pays for dino research? As Dodson notes, the post of academic paleontologist is a relatively new thing. Prior to the beginning of the 20th century most paleontologists were self funded enthusiasts who either used their family fortunes O.C. Marsh and E.D. Cope, for example or sold fossils the Sternberg family, for example to underwrite their work. Studies of dinosaurs became institutionalized in museums and colleges, but like other scientists, paleontologists still struggle to bring in enough money to support their studies. Now and then a wealthy benefactor might provide some funding, and some foundations set aside money for exciting dinosaur research, but for most paleontologists most of the time, research funding comes in the form of grants. Securing a grant can be a trying task. Paleontologists continually write to different foundations and societies in the hopes of winning some of the more prestigious grants which, Dodson says, are typically those that bring in the most funding to the paleontologists home institution. Among the biggest pools to which researchers apply is the government agency the National Science Foundation. The overall budget of the agency is over 6 billion, but a relatively tiny slice of that pie goes to paleontologists in a given year. As calculated by Dodson, between 1983 and 2009 the NSF awarded 88 grants to carry out research on dinosaurs and their close relatives, totaling a relatively modest 11 million in funds. Most dinosaur specialists rely on funding from other sources for most of their careers. For paleontologists, Dodson concludes, funding research is catch as catch can. Scientists are continually submitting and resubmitting proposals to foundations like the NSF in the hopes of receiving large grants that will allow them to comfortably carry out their work, yet most of the time dinosaur specialists must rely on a collection of smaller grants, the patronage of private donors, partnerships with television companies, and other opportunities in order to keep working. These days being a successful paleontologist requires business acumen as well as intellectual creativity. While it can be difficult to find funding, the rewards of such effortsa better understanding of ancient lifeare well worth the struggle."}, {"title": "\u201cBird\u201d Wrists Evolved Among Dinosaurs", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "March 3, 2010", "doc": "If there is one persistent gripe that paleontologists have with dinosaurs on screen, it is that their hands are usually wrong. From Tyrannosaurus to Velociraptor, predatory dinosaurs are time and again shown with their hands in a palms down position, something that would have been anatomically impossible at least without moving the arms to which those wrists were attached to. This does not mean that the wrists of theropod dinosaurs were inflexible, though. As reported in a new study just published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, some theropod dinosaurs had a unique wrist structure that may have greatly influenced the evolution of birds. Take a look at your own hands for a moment. Stick one out in front of you so that your palm is oriented straight up and down. Now imagine that you could bend your wrist so much on the pinky side that your fingers would be pointing straight backwards towards your elbow. That is what birds can do, and it is important to the way they fly and fold up their wings when on the ground. As with many other bird characteristics, though, this feature evolved first among dinosaurs, and it probably had its beginnings in something that did not have anything at all to do with flight. As outlined by paleontologists Corwin Sullivan, David Hone, Xing Xu and Fucheng Zhang in their new study, the evolution of a peculiar wrist bone in theropod dinosaurs called the semi lunate carpal allowed the wrists of predatory dinosaurs to become more flexible. This may have had something to do with hunting, but regardless of the reason why it evolved, it set the stage for the evolution of increased wrist flexibility among the ancestors of birds. Maniraptoran dinosaurs were a diverse group, containing an array of feathered dinosaurs from the weird therizinosaurs to the famous raptors and birds, and as this group evolved many lineages were adapted to have greater wrist flexibility. This can be seen in their anatomy the degree of asymmetry in the wrist bones provides an indication of how far the wrist could be flexed. Not surprisingly, the feathered dinosaurs most closely related to birds show the greatest amount of flexibility, but why were their wrists adapted in this way? Nobody knows for sure. It had originally been proposed that this flexibility could be attributed to hunting, but the same changes are seen in maniraptorans that were herbivores and omnivores so it is unlikely that hunting provides the answer. Instead, the authors of the new study propose, the ability to fold the hands backwards would have protected the feathers of the arms. This would have prevented the feathers from getting damaged or from being in the way as the dinosaurs moved about, although the authors recognize that this hypothesis requires further evidence. Perhaps more significant, however, is how this wing folding mechanism may have allowed birds to take to the air. Birds do flex their wrists while flapping their wings to fly, and so it appears that the wrist flexibility that first evolved in dinosaurs was later co opted for flight in birds. This is what is known as exaptation, or when a previous adaptation takes on a new function. Indeed, as more is discovered about the evolution of birds, the more traits paleontologists find that evolved for one function but have been co opted for another at a later point feathers themselves being the most prominent example. There is relatively little separating birds from their feathered dinosaur ancestors. For more on this new study see Not Exactly Rocket Science and Dave Hones Archosaur Musings.

A notable exception, however if I do say so myself, is my forthcoming book about evolution and the fossil record called Written in Stone. After years of hard work it will finally hit shelves on November 1, 2010. But before I get too carried away with self promotion, I have to address a question that I have been asked many times during the writing process Do we really need another book about paleontology? The answer is an emphatic Yes Even though numerous summaries of the overwhelming evidence for evolution have been published in the past year, the discipline of paleontology has often taken a backseat to genetics and microbiology. Fossils might demonstrate the fact of evolution, some authors imply, but to really understand how evolution works we need to look at living systems that we can observe right now. As Richard Dawkins wrote in The Ancestors Tale, even if there were no fossil record at all, living organisms still would provide abundant evidence for evolution. Hence, in Dawkins view, the fossil record is a non essential bonus that is not truly necessary to understand how life has changed. But I am not convinced by Dawkins argument. During the 19th century, speculations about evolution or a natural law that regulated the origin of species, as it was often referred to at the time were heavily influenced by fossils. Not only had fossils confirmed that species could become extinct, but they also illustrated that life on Earth was composed of a shifting cast of actors that appeared and disappeared over time. This was particularly significant to Charles Darwin, who began the introduction to On the Origin of Species by explaining how the relationship between the living and fossil mammals of South America got him thinking about the mystery of mysteries, evolution. Even though Darwin deduced the mechanisms of natural and sexual selection from what could be observed among living organisms, the true power of his view of evolution was that all living things were linked together by common ancestry through a natural process that had operated over millions of years. What was observed in the present could be used to make predictions about the shape of the tree of life, and so the findings of paleontology have acted as a test of Darwins ideas. At first many paleontologists felt that the fossil record did not accord well with evolution by natural selection, but during the past sixty years scientists have confirmed that Darwin was right about the pattern of life. This is where many accounts stop, with paleontology acting as a sort of handmaiden to other evolutionary sciences, but there is much more to the story. Geology and comparative anatomy still make up the core of paleontology, but many researchers have been combining these more traditional aspects of the discipline with methods from genetics, microbiology, embryology and other sciences. Paleontologists are no longer just documenting transitions in the fossil record. They are using new approaches to explain how those transitions could have occurred. Research published within the subdiscipline of dinosaur paleontology during the past year alone illustrates the spread of this synthetic approach. Last June paleontologists published a description of Limusaurus, a strange theropod dinosaur that may help explain a developmental shift in how the hands of dinosaurs and their bird descendants formed. Another team found degraded soft tissue material inside the bones of a different dinosaur, Brachylophosaurus, and the research drew upon microbiology and genetics as much as on traditional paleontology. And, since we know that birds are living dinosaurs, some paleontologists have even considered trying to reverse engineer a chicken into something dinosaur like by fiddling with genes the birds still possess. There are many more studies that could be mentioned, but this handful of examples illustrates how paleontology is becoming more of an interdisciplinary science that can provide new insights into how life evolved. So while I will not dispute Dawkins point that we could learn a lot about evolution by studying living creatures alone, I cannot so easily write off the fossil record as just a collection of curiosities. An understanding of the history of life on Earth has always been important to considerations about evolution. The interdisciplinary nature of many new studies has made paleontology more important than ever. No understanding of evolution is complete without a healthy appreciation for the fossil record, and I hope that my forthcoming book will help explain why so much of what we understand about evolution is written in stone."}, {"title": "Were Dinosaurs Meant to Fly?", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "December 16, 2009", "doc": "One of the most important insights Charles Darwin had was that evolution does not follow a pre ordained path. There is no evolutionary endpoint that organisms are striving toward. The endless forms most beautiful we observe in nature are both shaped by adaption to local conditions and constrained by the contingencies of their history, and it is impossible to predict what life might look like 1 million, 10 million, or 100 million years from now. But paleontologist Simon Conway Morris begs to differ. He argues that some evolutionary outcomes are inevitable. If this were true then it could be argued that our species had been planned all along, thus allowing for a closer correspondence between cherished religious beliefs and what we know about nature. Conway Morris makes his case primarily through identifying evolutionary convergences, a natural phenomenon in which two unrelated organisms independently evolve the same trait. If a particular trait has evolved multiple times, Conway Morris argues, then it can be treated as an inevitable outcome of evolution which therefore suggests in his view that life is being pulled in a particular direction by some supernatural force. In his latest exposition of this idea, published in the journal Naturwissenschaften, Conway Morris appeals to the evolution of birds to help support his thesis. According to Conway Morris, birds evolved at least three times. In addition to the earliest recognized bird Archaeopteryx, the four winged dromaeosaur Microraptor and its relative Rahonavis might be considered dinosaurs that independently acquired some degree of flight. For Conway Morris the convergent evolution of flying dinosaurs several times means that evolution is following a predictable pathway if birds did not evolve from one lineage of feathered dinosaurs then they certainly would have evolved from another. But there are some severe problems with this interpretation. First, it is still not entirely clear how Archaeopteryx, Microraptor, and Rahonavis flew, if they could fly at all. They were all small, bird like dinosaurs that possessed what we call flight feathers, but this does not mean that they all flew or flew the same way. They may have been gliders rather than fliers, especially Microraptor, and while each is relevant to understanding the origin of birds we cannot honestly interpret each as definite evolutionary step towards birds of today. Indeed, feathers and other bird characteristics were widely shared among dinosaurs that were not ancestral to birds. Birds evolved only once, and the alternative lineages Conway Morris sees as anchored to Microraptor and Rahonavis never came to be. He does not address why this might be so, but it has everything to do with the complementary roles of contingency and constraint in evolution. In many cases, the dinosaurs that possessed avian traits such as feathers could not be easily modified into flying creatures. Many were too big, had the wrong kind of feathers, or just did not have a lifestyle in which gliding or flying would have been advantageous to survival and reproduction. Little quirks of evolutionary history and ecology constrained how feathered dinosaurs could be modified from one generation to the next, and it was in only one lineage, by chance, that the circumstances caused the first birds to evolve. Likewise, the fact that birds survived the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous could not have been predicted beforehand. Had they perished, we probably would not be spending so much time talking about them now as they would be, in our biased view, just another evolutionary dead end. Despite all this, however, Conway Morris concludes Avian theropods are, therefore, pre ordained. I cannot help but think of this as a case of confirmation bias. In battling a straw man, ultra Darwinian view, Conway Morris treats every case of convergence as evidence of inevitability in evolution, thereby ignoring the roles of contingency and constraint in shaping the tree of life. If a group of dinosaurs of similar body shape inherits feathers from a common ancestor, for example, then of course it would be expected that some of them might be adapted in similar ways given their shared characteristics. The resulting convergences would not be the result of inevitability, but based upon the constraints of surviving and reproducing given a common starting state. Evolutionary convergence is a real pattern, and an interesting one at that, but it has to be understood as being couched within evolutionary history. It is not productive to simply cherry pick occurrences of traits evolving more than once and then state that it was all meant to be. At a grand scale, though, I think that the wider diversity of dinosaurs undercuts Conway Morris argument for evolutionary inevitability. Dinosaurs have been around for over 230 million years, and during their time on earth they have diversified into a wide array of unique forms that generally have not been duplicated by mammals. There have been some instances of convergence, as between the armored ankylosaurs and the hard shelled mammals called glyptodonts, but you would think that if evolution was proceeding in a fore ordained direction most dinosaurs would have made the next step to whatever Conway Morris believes should have come after them. Yet no such signal is readily visible. Hence the evolution of dinosaurs and all other life\u00a0 is better viewed through Darwins perspective, and I think the notion that dinosaurs were not predestined makes them all the more fascinating."}, {"title": "Paleontologists Announce New Tiny Dinosaur", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "October 26, 2009", "doc": "From movies to museums, the most famous dinosaurs are among the largest. We like superlatives, and want to know what the biggest, fastest, and fiercest dinosaurs are. Yet, just like living animals, dinosaurs came in a variety of shapes and sizes, and a team of paleontologists has just announced, in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, one of the smallest dinosaurs yet discovered. Named Fruitadens haagarorum, this diminutive dinosaur from the 150 million year old strata of western Colorado was only about two and a half feet long. It was a heterodontosaurid, or a member of a group of ornithischian dinosaurs that split off early from the family tree and persisted for millions of years. It is the first time a heterodontosaurid dinosaur has been found in North America. While many other ornithischian dinosaurs like hadrosaurs and horned dinosaurs were herbivores, though, it appears that Fruitadens was an omnivore. Like other heterodontosaurids it had at least three kinds of teeth peg like teeth at the front of the jaw, a single large tusk or canine like tooth, and a series of leaf shaped teeth good for shearing plants. This would have allowed it to eat a variety of foods, including meat, and its small body size probably meant that it had to. The bodies of small animals are typically more energetically expensive than those of large ones, meaning that small animals have to find high quality food like fruit and flesh and consume a lot of it. They cannot get by eating only relatively poor quality food such as leaves. Such is the price of small body size, and thus Fruitadens may have been a late surviving relic of an early radiation of small, omnivorous dinosaurs that later gave rise to more specialized plant eating giants."}, {"title": "Early Bird Archaeopteryx Grew More Like A Dinosaur", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "October 14, 2009", "doc": "Modern birds grow amazingly fast. After hatching, many species grow to adult size in a matter of days to weeks. But a new study published in the journal PLoS One suggests that birds did not always exhibit the same rapid rate of growth. By looking at chips of bone taken from the legs of some of the earliest birds and their close dinosaur relatives, paleontologist Gregory Erickson and colleagues found that when it came to growing up, early birds like Archaeopteryx were a lot more like dinosaurs than their living relatives. In order to study how Archaeopteryx and other early birds such as Jeholornis and Sapeornis grew, paleontologists had to move beyond gross anatomy and look at the microscopic structure of the fossilized bone sampled from the legs of the selected specimens. Different growth rates are represented by the presence of patterning of different kinds of bone, and what the scientists expected to find was rings of bone filled with holes for blood vessels that represent rapid growth. Instead they found bone tissue that was not well supplied by blood vessels and was more similar to that of slow growing animals, like living reptiles. This presented something of a paradox. Larger dinosaurs that were closely related to birds, but not actually birds, had bone tissue indicative of rapid growthyet the earliest birds did not. Why should this be? The scientists proposed that it may be a matter of size. The larger the animal that was studied, the more their bones seemed to indicate fast growth. The small dinosaur Mahakala, by contrast, exhibited bone types more similar to that seen in the early birds. This suggested that growth patterns were tied to size and that the earliest birds had inherited their relatively slow growth rate from their small dinosaur ancestors. Indeed, while presently recognized as the earliest bird, Archaeopteryx had far more in common with its dinosaur forebears than modern birds, leading the authors of the paper to conclude, Archaeopteryx was simply a feathered and presumably volant dinosaur."}, {"title": "Pulling Back the Curtain on Dinosaur Science", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "September 9, 2009", "doc": "Everyone knows that paleontologists study fossils, but how do they actually do that? How do scientists go from discovering a fossil bone to describing that fossil in a scientific journal? The public rarely sees how scientists work, but a new initiative called the Open Dinosaur Project might help to change that. Over the past few years there have been many calls to make science more open    to let anyone who is interested view science as it is happening. Now three paleontologists    Andy Farke of the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology, Matt Wedel of the Western University of Health Sciences, and Mike Taylor of University College London   \u00a0 have devised away to allow the public not only witness science in progress but also to participate in it. The researchers want to better understand the evolutionary changes in limb bones in ornithischian dinosaurs, or the large group that contained the horned dinosaurs, ankylosaurs, hadrosaurs, stegosaurs, and others. This will require the collection of a lot of data, and this is where you come in. In order to measure enough dinosaur limbs Farke, Wedel, and Taylor will need a group of dedicated volunteers, and those volunteers could be almost anyone. As the scientists write What will those volunteers do? Since many scientific journals are allowing the public increased access at no charge, almost anyone with an Internet connection could contribute something to the researchers database. The precise details of this project have yet to be announced, and the paleontologists acknowledge that there will be some fine tuning along the way, but the Open Dinosaur Project will give almost anyone a chance to contribute something to paleontology.

The CDDVD album is meant to help introduce kids to scientific concepts, from the states of matter to evolution, and my natural favorite is their tune I Am a Paleontologist. The band even released the video for the song as a special preview, which you can see above. I have a few minor quibbles with the song and video. Paleontology is about much more than dinosaur bones paleontologists study all forms of life from fossil bacteria to prehistoric whales, and the field has increasingly been incorporating studies of development, genetics and microbiology to get a more detailed look at ancient life. Looking for fossils in the field is still a core part of paleontology, but that is far from being all that paleontologists do. Also, the real name of the Carnotaur they refer to is Carnotaurus, a predatory dinosaur from the Cretaceous of South America, and fossil elephants like the one dancing along in the background do not have bones in their trunk. Still, the song is a lot of fun and I just cant get the song out of my head.

According to the BBC, the recent cessation of Angolas civil war has allowed paleontologists to start working in the country again. As the news company states, the country seems to be a new fossil frontier that is brimming with the petrified remains of ancient creatures as yet unknown to scientists. Many of the fossils that have been found in Angola so far have been from fish, turtles, sharks and extinct forms of marine reptiles like mosasaurs and plesiosaurs. Many of these fossils are sticking out of the ground, just waiting to be picked up, and there may be some new dinosaurs to find, too. In 2005, the paleontologist Octavio Mateus from Portugals New Lisbon University found elements from the front leg of a sauropod dinosaur. While the rest of the skeleton remains elusive, Mateus has stated his confidence that more dinosaur fossils will soon come to light. Access to fossil sites is very important to paleontology. Paleontologists not only want to understand what the past was like at one particular place, but what the whole world was like in the prehistoric past. In order to do this paleontologists must study numerous sites from various ages at places all over the world, the more the better, and who knows what new secrets the Angola deposits might turn up?"}, {"title": "Dinosaurs Along the Silk Road", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "August 26, 2009", "doc": "I have often wanted to visit the natural history museums and famed fossil sites of China, but sadly such a trip is a bit out of my price range.

It is important to stay on top of the latest peer reviewed articles and symposium volumes, but every now and then I like to pull a yellowing old science book from the shelf and see what scientists of centuries past had to say. One of my favorite volumes in my little library is a copy of O.C. Marshs 1896 masterpiece The Dinosaurs of North America. Marsh was one of the foremost American paleontologists of the late 19th century, and he had a major role in establishing the study of dinosaurs as we know it today. Printed by the U.S. Geological Survey, the huge monograph contains descriptions of many of the most famous dinosaurs like Triceratops, Ceratosaurus and Stegosaurus. Many of these scientific descriptions are matched with beautifully printed plates depicting individual bones and restored skeleton. Beyond its scientific importance, it is really a beautiful book to look at. Until recently it was pretty difficult to find this volume. Only a few copies were in circulation and you had to pay through the nose if you wanted to own one. Fortunately, though, the book is so old that it is now in the public domain and can be shared freely on the internet. If you want to have a look at it yourself, check out the O.C. Marsh Papers Web site. It contains a copy of the book in PDF format, as well as numerous other papers written by Marsh. It is a treasure trove of classic paleontology, and hopefully we will someday see a similar repository of papers written by Marshs famous professional rival, E.D. Cope."}, {"title": "Oops! Dinosaur Find Actually Fossilized Wood!", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "August 10, 2009", "doc": "Naming a new dinosaur can be a tricky thing. Although nearly complete skeletons often make headlines, more often than not new species are based upon fragmentary material. In these cases further discoveries are often needed to determine whether the species really is new, and every now and then it turns out that the fossils really belonged to a previously known species. This can be frustrating, but it is the way science works, and it is nowhere near as bad as when a 19th century naturalist created a new dinosaur based upon a plant fossil. In 1887 the naturalist Abbe G. Smets found two fossils in France that he thought represented a new kind of dinosaur. According to Smets, the dark colored fossils were parts of the jaw of a Hadrosaurus like dinosaur, and he named his find Aachenosaurus. Obviously there was not a lot to go on, but Smets felt so confident that he even issued a full scale restoration of what he thought they dinosaur might have looked like. The paleontologist Louis Dollo and the botanist Maurice Hovelacque disagreed. When they investigated Smets fossils they discovered that the fossils did not belong to a dinosaur at all. Instead the fragments were just bits of fossil wood Smets protested and viciously attacked Dollo in print, but other naturalists saw this as desperation on Smets part. The findings of Dollo and Hovelacque were much better supported no matter how angry this made Smets. This was the opinion of G.A. Boulenger and Richard Lydekker, who published a note entitled A Wooden Dinosaur in the March 20, 1889, issue of the Geological Magazine. As Boulenger and Lydekker wrote, Smets appeared to Indeed, Boulenger and Lydekker were especially aggravated to find that Smets had attempted to use their research to discredit Dollo. This was perhaps the main reason that the two wrote their notice in the first place. Dollo was a well respected paleontologist and no amount of name calling by Smets was going to change that. Smets was only making a fool of himself by trying to turn other naturalists upon each other, and his wooden dinosaur had rotted away."}, {"title": "Paleo-Profile of David Hone: China, Blogging, and Bone-Eating Dinosaurs", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "August 6, 2009", "doc": "Vertebrate paleontologist David Hone has always been obsessed and fascinated by animals. He got his start studying zoology and working at the London Zoo, but his attention later turned to much more ancient creatures. Vertebrate paleontology has benefited from his shift of focus. Since beginning his career as a paleontologist Hone has made important contributions to studies of pterosaurs, theropod dinosaurs, and other extinct creatures. I recently got the chance to ask Hone, who is presently studying paleontology in Beijing, China, a few questions via e mail about his work and what it is like to be a paleontologist. Brian Switek You have just recently returned from a field site in China containing a fossil bed from the late Cretaceous, the end of the time of the dinosaurs. What kinds of animals are found there? What was it like there during the time those animals lived and died? David Hone Its a fair mix actually and basically the same as the Late Cretaceous of North Americawe have large tyrannosaurs Tarbosaurus, ankylosaurs, dromaeosaurs Velociraptor, neoceratopsians Protoceratops, mononykines, hadrosaurs, oviraptorosaurs and troodontids. You dont have to know much about dinosaurs to see thats quite a bit of variation. The one difference is there are sauropods in China which are not present in northern North America they are in Mexico and southern U.S., but not the north and Canada which in itself is interestingwhy are these two ecosystems, so far apart in space since it is thought they were on separate continents at the time so similar, but with one major exception? That implies some kind of long standing connection but if that is the case, why did the sauropods not make it when everything else did? As for the environment, it was probably pretty similar to the one we see today there. Fairly rocky and desert y with scrubby plants clinging on. Of course there was a large river delta in the exact area we were searching thats how many things got buried but in other parts of China and Mongolia that are an extension of the beds we are searching it was far more like a desert and animals were typically buried in sand, such as the legendary fighting dinosaurs. Between these two factors there is of course a lot of interest as effectively you have two near identical faunas in different places and different environments. This can potentially tell you a lot about the evolution of the ecosystems as a whole and the evolution of each of the clades. Its always great to have a comparison, the trick as ever is how to make those comparisons correctly to get the information you want. BS Field work can be a pretty tough experience. What was your average day like while at the field site? What difficulties did you encounter in your search for fossils? DH Basically wed drive out from our camp and just prospect a nice technical term for looking around for a couple of hours, have lunch, compare notes and go back out. If you found something good it would be marked up for later or collected if it was small. That was basically the first two weeks and then we went back for the last two and evaluated what we had and set about protecting and digging up what we wanted to take back. There were no major obstacles but of course there are always problems, we lost the cars more than once, you can easily get lost or run out of water in the desert and there are snakes and scorpions and plenty of ticks in all the kinds of nooks and crannies in which you are supposed to be digging. Ive had plenty of worse experiences in my travels and on average it was pretty easy going. This year we ran into sandstorms and at one point got hit by a hailstorm, in a desert, in Juneincredible. Last year we had better weather but much longer drives to the filed sites which took up a lot of time, so its always different. BS How did you become a paleontologist? What experiences helped make you decide that you wanted to study extinct animals? DH None really, it was largely chance. Ive always been an animal nut, but my preference was for living stuff my degree was in zoology and while I had done bits of palaeo where I could, it was never my main interest. While on my Masters course the option came up to do something dinosaur based the clade was actually irrelevant, they were just a good group to pick for an evolutionary study and that led me to dealing with Adam Yates of Dracoventaor fame, Davide Pisani and the legend that is Mike Benton back at Bristol where I had done my bachelors but in the biological sciences department, not geology, the two being rather well separated as subjects in the U.K.. When I was looking to do a Ph.D., Mike offered to take me on and it started there. If one of my other choices had come through earlier Id probably have carried on with the work I was doing in fish mechanics or behaviour but thats how these things go sometimes. It was chance and timing rather than desire, though if Id been offered a position on slug physiology then Id probably still be looking... More about Archosaur Musings and predatory dinosaurs after the jump... BS You write a blog called Archosaur Musings. Do you feel that your writing there helps you to communicate your research to the public better? DH I really do, though whether or not the public agree is another matter. I found out a while back that a good friend of mine is a keen reader and it has rather changed my approach to the whole thing as Oliver is a computer techie of the highest order as I hope he doesnt mind me saying. I had been writing for the dino geeks primarily and as a relaxation for myself not having to worry about citations and all the petty annoyances that go with normal papers and basically just hoped to correct a few misconceptions and get the odd person more aware of how real science works. However, now I am really trying to engage with people at any level and reach a more general audience and I go to the trouble of explaining what I think are simple terms and really lay out all the basics. In fact Ive now started a big chain of posts that I expect will run and run on science basics which deals with science itself and not just archosaurs. There is a ton of blogs out there on science but every single one seems to be written for people who are at a minimum already interested in the field be it physics or palaeo. If you are someone very ordinary who last did science at high school aged 16 or so and now want to learn a bit from the internet, the vast majority of blogs are useless of the ones I have browsed. It just assumes too much knowledge which is fine for the target audience, but not for everyone not that I dont put up plenty of bits like this myself. Ive already noted about how some issues I was never taught at school or even university and yet are fundamental to scientific thinking, what chance has Joe Public got or even Joe the plumber? I hope to try and change that a little bit. Time will tell. In the main on the blog I try to talk about various bits of palaeontology that you wont see elsewhere. The media and by extension the public somehow seem to think that fossils go in one end, computers and research happens and then a press release comes out with a paper at the end. Everyone talks about new research and what it means, but it is incredibly important to talk about the process. How did it get done, what did they do and not do, and why? How did they come up with the idea, how were they able to test it, how did they know what to look for? Where did the money come from, how did they get the paper published, what did the fieldwork involve? Are there obvious weakness with the research that need to be addressed, does it flat contradict something we have seen before and if so, why? This entire side of things is pretty much never addressed, even if the author has a blog of his own, but we need to show the public that we know what we are doing and why. Science is not a black box, anyone can understand it and anyone can do it. Its a fundamental misunderstanding or hidden concept that allows the quacks and creationists a foothold and we can deny them it is we actually both top point this out, though of course you also have to make people listen which is far harder. Onto the actual dinosaur content, the archosaurs for those who dont know are a group of reptiles that essentially include everything in the family tree between birds and crocodiles and thus dinosaurs, pterosaurs and a bunch of others. It stated as a blog on the DinoBase site and was named by Darren Naish on one of his posts before I had even set up on wordpress. As a result the content of the blog is largely dictated by a name given to it by someone else, rather than me there cant be too many of them out there Still, basically I keep on in the same vein for the actual dinosaur and pterosaur stuff as I do with the actual science  just trying to lay out the basics. What are pterosaurs? How do we define them? What were they like and what fossil evidence is that based on? There is obviously a ton of dinosaur blogs out there and a couple dealing primarily with pterosaurs too but I like to think I bring something a little different and of course there are few professional bloggers out there. Though how much longer I remain professional largely depends on me getting my next contract. BS Thats far from your only outreach project through isnt it? DH Thats right, theres quite a list actuallyI started the QA website Ask a Biologist so that people everywhere can ask a panel or academics anything about biology thought mostly this involves us telling them we wont do their homework for them and we have now taken about 2000 questions in about two years. Next I contribute to DinoBase which is more of a forum and database site for dinosaurs and actually spawned the Musings. I have a new pterosaur site on the way with a bunch of colleagues, and I recently sent some stuff to the excellent Why Science. Ive also done various radio and TV bits and sent off the odd article to popular palaeomagazines and when Im in the U.K. I try to do school visits and public lectures on science and dinosaurs. It keeps me busy, certainly. BS Why is it important to study paleontology? DH Tricky one. My stock answer is always because it expands human knowledge which sounds either philosophical or poncey depending on your take, but I think its a valid answer. I just want to know. Everything. All the time. I was like that as a kid, just asking why? all the time which is basically how Ask A Biologist got started, I wanted to give people the kind of service I would have loved as a childand probably my parents and teachers too for that matter to shut me up though somewhat inevitably always about animals or biology in some regard and that has never left me, but now instead of asking other people I can find out for myself. If you want something a bit more practical it can tell us about the past and this is very important for looking at the future and never more so in the current climate crisis, though of course its hard to tack tyrannosaur taxonomy onto carbon emissions, but I can probably try. Even then you would be surprised what can be applicable for example the work I am involved in developing new aeroelastics based on pterosaur wings. The engineers are just boggled that you can actually do this, that an animal extinct for 65 million years is decades ahead of what they can make. Of course they are also annoyed that no one ever told them it had already been done BS I hear that you are working on a new website all about pterosaurs. Could you explain what this project is and why you took up the task? DH Yes and yes. And I will too. The site is basically a brief primer on pterosaurs, everything about pterosaursflight, evolution and relationships, behaviour, the fossils, even pop culture references and a fair bit more. Its started from zero knowledge so if you come in and know nothing about them at all, you should be able to follow it. Even if you come in a relative expert you should still learn plenty as the contributor list should blow you away. There are maybe 15 people who work on pterosaurs full time and perhaps another 30 or 40 for whom its a major component of their research including Ph.D. students and here are a dozen of them writing this site like Dino Frey and Ross Elgin. Thanks to our connections we were also able to get photos of all kinds of rare and important specimens that are currently not on the web at all, as well as artwork from Luis Rey, and John Conway and photos from Helmut Tischlinger. I would humbly submit that its one hell of a package and with luck there will be a blog attached too, so the bloggers among us like myself, Darren Naish and Mark Witton can cross post all our pterosaur stuff there. As for the why, I guess there are a few reasons. First off it seemed necessarythere are hundreds of dinosaur sites and yet only a few for pterosaurs and frankly, most of them are pretty poor. Secondly, I am constantly throwing out new stuff like this the Musings, stuff on DinoBase, Ask A Biologist and more and this seemed like the most obvious thing to do. Thirdly to counter some of the terrible information that is out there from some of the fringe people of which pterosaurs seem to draw more than their fair share. Finally in an Everest moment, because it could be done. Id love to see this as a model for future projects like this with various people putting together things like this online. Obviously I have a real bent for science communication stuff, but Id love to see a bunch of theropod people get together and do a unified theropod website like this aimed specifically at the public, then one on conservation and one on pine trees or whatever. A tree of life project for communication with all the relevant researchers giving up just a bit of time and effort to put together a small site explaining about their pet subject and what they are like. Pterosaurs were obvious not only because Im a pterosaur worker, but because its a relatively small group that can be handled easily in this way in manner in which say a site on dinosaurs canttheyre just too big for a small group to handle. A pipe dream perhaps, but it could happen. There are lots of superb sites out there, but they are all so disjointed and often all trying to do the same thing. You dont need ten average theropod sites all saying the same thing in the same way, you want one good one that tells you everything. Same amount of effort, much better for everyone. I should stress that the sites not quite ready yet since there are various tweaks to finish off but it should be out soon, but then we said that about a year ago BS Just this week you co authored a paper with Oliver Rauhut where you suggest that large predatory dinosaurs may have preferentially targeted juvenile dinosaurs. Some recent studies have suggested that juvenile sauropods, horned dinosaurs, and ornithomimosaurs traveled together in groups. Is this consistent with the hypothesis in your new paper that predatory dinosaurs might have preferentially targeted juvenile dinosaurs? DH I would argue that it is, but its a tricky thing to cover. This did get a minimal bit of coverage in the paper since you cant discuss everything you would like to at great length in a paper like this as you rather veer off topicId have happily written a couple of pages on the subject and its certainly something I want to follow up on with my behavior work. Returning to the thrust of the question juvenile animals of all kinds are vulnerable to predators for a bunch of reasons, they have higher relative energy requirements than adults since they are growing, tend to forage in low quality areas with less good food or less good cover since they lack experience and adults can bully them off the better sites and as a result of these tend to forage for longer, and being less experienced with predators are less good at avoiding them. As a result they are pretty vulnerable to predation and anything they can do to mitigate this would be of great help to them. Obviously herbivores send a lot of time eating and when they are doing that they are not looking for predators, but if you form a group them at any one time a couple of animals will be looking for predators and looking in various directions which really boosts the overall awareness of the group as a whole. In short, it makes evolutionary sense for a group of juveniles to buddy up to scout for danger since they are at so much risk and this would fit my hypothesis that theropods were after juveniles. Its tricky to test though obviously and something that has yet to be seriously explored and of course we dont have too many records of this behaviour. BS Among modern predators there are some animals, like spotted hyenas, that specialize in crushing and consuming bones. Were there any predatory dinosaurs that filled the same role? Such a niche has been suggested for the recently described abelisaur Kryptops does this hypothesis consistent with the findings of your study? DH We have a specific section in the paper on large tyrannosaurs as putative bone crunchers. As such Im not sure whether you would say they fit with the hypothesis or not since we are not looking to cover every single clade or ecological niche for theropods. However I would say that the evidence as it lies in the literature and the currently available fossil evidence is that bone biters were quite rare  there are quite simply few records of theropods biting heavily and deliberately on bones. If these animals were consuming large pieces of bone we should start finding coprolites full of bone chunks and stomach contents with adults bones or bits of them in, but instead we find a few bits of bones from juveniles and not much else. I am happy with the idea that there were bone crunchers out there, even Allosaurus has demonstrated it could bite through the odd big piece of bone despite lacking any obvious adaptations for it but I dont think we will see anything in quite the mould of a hyena in terms of very heavy adaptations towards bone biting and bone consumption."}, {"title": "Why We Need the University of Wyoming Geological Museum", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "July 23, 2009", "doc": "Due to state funding cuts, the University of Wyoming Geological Museum was recently closed down. This is a crying shame, especially since good paleontology museums are as important as ever when it comes to helping the public understand science. Indeed, a recent opinion piece in Rock Springs, Wyomings Daily Rocket Miner underlines precisely why such institutions are so sorely needed. In an article titled Dinosaur, Founding Fathers point to Gods role as creator, Pastor Richard Carlson presented himself as a dinosaur expert. According to Carlson, scientists who have spent their lives digging through the rock, closely scrutinizing fossilized bones, and presenting their findings to the public and peers have it all wrong. Instead, dinosaurs walked the earth with humans less than 6,000 years ago, Carlson says, presenting himself as more of an authority on fossils than any professional paleontologist. Carlson attempts to support his case with some garden variety young Earth creationist nonsense. He claims that recently discovered remnants of soft tissues of the kind that have been found from a Tyrannosaurus and a Brachylophosaurus point to a young Earth.\u00a0 What Carlson misses is that the existence of degraded soft tissue structures in dinosaur fossils does not tell us how old these fossils are. Paleontologists use techniques like radiometric dating and biostratigraphy to determine the age of fossils, not the state of preservation of a particular fossil. Fossilization can vary widely in different settings and it is a mistake to consider something to be geologically young just because it is well preserved. While paleontologists carefully study the rocks and fossils themselves to investigate the past, Carlson takes a more dogmatic approach. He insists that exceptionally preserved fossils could only have been formed recently, probably within the last 6,000 years. What he does not tell you, however, is that this oft cited date for the beginning of the worlds creation according to young Earth creationists is nowhere to be found in the Bible. It is an interpretation based upon a narrow reading of a religious text, centuries old religious scholarship and a disavowal of anything that runs counter to Carlsons preconceived notions. It comes as no surprise that Carlson is not so much concerned with science as in defending his particular religious beliefs. So threatened is he, in fact, that he insists that there is no real paleontological or evolutionary science. Instead, paleontologists and evolutionary biologists are simply zealots bent on destroying religion. Carlson writes Im sure this would be news to many paleontologists, especially the ones who are Christians. Rather than provide any positive evidence for his claims, Carlson resorts to calling anyone who disagrees with his worldview an atheist.\u00a0 I wish I could just write off Carlson as a lone crank that could be safely ignored, but there are many people who would agree with his Dinotopia like vision of history. That is why good paleontology museums, like the one at the University of Wyoming, are so important. When it comes to evolution and paleontology, the public needs to hear from paleontologists, not pastors who are threatened by the fact that the history of the Earth does not match their fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible. Fortunately, it looks like steps are being made towards re opening the University of Wyoming museum now called the S.H. Knight Geological Museum. According to a recent article in the Laramie Boomerang, the museum will be re opened on a part time basis, although without a secretary or curator. The next step is raising enough funding to restore these positions so that scientific work and public tours can be started up again, and if you want to help in these efforts please visit the Keep Laramie Dinos website."}, {"title": "\u201cDakota\u201d the Hadrosaur Makes Her Debut", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "July 8, 2009", "doc": "In the winter of 2007, news agencies were all a twitter over the news of another mummy hadrosaur found in North Dakota. Nicknamed Dakota, the dinosaur was said to exceed the jackpot of what paleontologists could have hoped for, and two books, a documentary and a lecture tour were arranged to promote the fossil. All the while, however, scientists have been waiting for a scientific description of Dakota to be published. After a long wait, the first detailed study of Dakota finally appeared in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B this past week. Dinosaur mummies, or dinosaurs with skin impressions intact, have been known for over a century. What might make Dakota special, however, is that the fossil preserves much more than just the impressions of the skin. As recent research by paleobiologists like Mary Schweitzer has shown, sometimes degraded remnants of original dinosaur organic material can survive the fossilization process under the right conditions. The authors of the description of Dakota suggest that their specimen, too, contains some detailed traces of the dinosaurs original body. Even though the body of Dakota has yet to be fully uncovered, and the paleontologists are still unsure as to what species of Edmontosaurus the dinosaur is, enough of the fossil has been studied to reveal the exceptional detail of the dinosaurs preservation. Indeed, it appears that the fossil preserves about two inches of skin, not just impressions of the top layer, and in the skin layer are what appear to be cell like structures. There even seemed to be remnants of the tough sheath that would have covered some of the toe bones dinosaur toenail, and tests suggested that it, too, was preserved material from the original dinosaurs body. These findings are not quite as dramatic as the studies of preserved Tyrannosaurus and Brachylophosaurus soft tissue structures carried out by Mary Schweitzer and her colleagues, but it does suggest that we should look more closely at some other known dinosaur mummies. Perhaps they too preserve some cells or other minute details that have been ignored.

Dinosaur enthusiasts know that Tyrannosaurus was a Cretaceous dinosaur, for example, but fewer people know that Tyrannosaurus only lived at the very end of the Cretaceous, about 68 to 65 million years ago. The Cretaceous as a whole lasted from about 145 to 65 million years ago, and this makes the reign of the prehistoric tyrant a relatively short one by comparison. Not all parts of the Cretaceous are equally well known, though, and in a new paper published in Naturwissenschaften, paleontologists have described a large predatory dinosaur that helps fill in a significant gap in our knowledge of Asia during the Cretaceous. Up until now, paleontologists who have been studying the Cretaceous dinosaurs of Asia have primarily been working with the bookends to a series. The Late Jurassic, from about 161 to 145 million years ago, and Late Cretaceous in Asia are relatively well known, but there is a 60 million year gap spanning the Early and Middle Cretaceous from which little is known. While scientists have found some smaller dinosaurs from the earlier part of the Cretaceous, remains of large predatory dinosaurs have often been so fragmentary that it has been difficult to tell what sort of theropods were roaming the landscape. Were they the ancestors of the later tyrannosaurids, or did some of these teeth and shards of bone belong to other predators? The fossils described by the paleontologists in the new paper provide evidence that large non tyrannosaurid theropods once hunted in the Cretaceous of Asia. The first fossils of this dinosaur were discovered decades ago and called\u00a0Chilantaisaurus maortuensis, a new species within a large theropod genus known from other fossilsbut there was a problem. The fossils for the new species did not match any of the bones used to describe the other Chilantaisaurus species, so researchers could not be sure if they were really belonged to the same genus of dinosaur or not. The fossils remained in a sort of limbo for years, but last January paleontologist Steve Brusatte had another look at the Chilantaisaurus maortuensis fossils and noticed something peculiar. Different scientists had placed the species within several different theropod groups, but Brusatte saw that the fossils clearly had traits that linked it to carcharodontosaurids, large predators known primarily from Africa and South America. One from Asia had never been found before. Brusatte teamed up with Roger Benson, Dan Chure, Xu Xing, Corwin Sullivan, and Dave Hone to describe the fossil, and they came to some interesting conclusions. The first order of business was giving this dinosaur a new name. Based upon the available skull material they rechristened the fossils Shaochilong maortuensis, the shark tooth dragon. But what was a carcharodonotosaurid doing in Asia? How did it get there? There are not concrete answers to these questions yet, but during the Early and Middle Cretaceous Asia may have held a curious mix of dinosaurs previously segregated in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. As paleontologist Thomas Holtz mentioned in a mailing list comment about this paper, this discovery might make possible a scenario previously regarded as fictional large carcharodontosaurids may have hunted and eaten horned dinosaurs.

If you think this is a question easily answered, you are sorely mistaken. In many ways sauropods were unlike any living creatures, and scientists have been debating their posture for years. Indeed, last month a short communication in Science suggested that the ancient giants held their heads low to the ground, but a new paper published in Acta Palaeontologica Polonica by Mike Taylor, Matt Wedel, and Darren Naish who are also behind the SV POW blog suggests that these dinosaurs regularly held their heads high. A large part of the current debate has to do with the different ways of approaching the problem. You can study the bones of dinosaurs to get an idea of their posture, but they also would have required physiological mechanisms to do things like maintain blood pressure. A scientist who bases his or her hypothesis on skeletal anatomy may reach a very different conclusion than one who tries to reconstruct sauropod physiology. The authors of the new paper decided to look at the skeletal evidence and compared the necks of sauropods to many kinds of living vertebrates to see if the way living animals hold their necks could answer some questions about sauropods. When they looked at the neck posture of birds, rabbits, cats, rodents, and primates, the team found that these animals typically held their necks vertically and that the middle part of the neck was relatively rigid. They also found that the living animals often had more flexibility in their necks than you would think just looking at bones alone. More striking, though, was that the animals studied, including the closest living relatives to dinosaurs birds and crocodylians, held their necks up, not down. If almost all other land dwelling vertebrates were doing it, there is a good chance sauropods were doing it, too. From what they found, the scientists strongly suggest that not only did sauropods hold their necks above a horizontal position, but they had a much wider range of motion than other scientists have suggested. I have no doubt that the posture of sauropods will continue to be debated, especially in terms of physiology and feeding, but this paper is a very important contribution to the discussion. As the authors state, unless they were unlike almost all groups of terrestrial vertebrates, sauropods were holding their heads high.

The majority of the fossil record is far more fragmentary, and while little scraps of bone might not cause journalists to start drooling they are just as important to understanding ancient life. Take the case of a bit of femur, or thighbone, described in the latest issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. Described by Catherine Forster, Andrew Farke, Jacob McCartney, William De Klerk and Callum Ross, the small bit of bone was recovered from rock in South Africa dating to about 140 million years ago. The fossils in that area are very fragmentary, it is not the sort of place you would expect to find an articulated skeleton, but there is enough there to know the area was once roamed by a diverse group of dinosaurs. Among the collection of dinosaurs at the site was a small predatory coelurosaur called Nqwebasaurus try saying that 10 times fast, but when scientists described it they found fragments from a second, unknown theropod dinosaur. This is the dinosaur the recently described femur came from, but what sort of dinosaur was it? With so little to go on, the authors of the new paper were unsure of precisely what sort of dinosaur it might be, but it seemed to belong to the tetanurae, one of the great groups of theropod dinosaurs. There was another group of varied theropods during the time called the abelisauridae, but a number of characteristics of this fossil do not match that group. Instead it does seem to be a tetanuran, but more fossils will be needed to more fully understand what it is.

In fact, 28 fossils of the super snakes were found. They are believed to have been 42 49 feet long and weighed 2,500 pounds previous records were 33 feet and 403 pounds. Carlos Jaramillo, a staff scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, co organized the team that discovered the biggest snake the team included other Smithsonian scientists as well as experts from the University of Florida and other institutions.  Smithsonians Bruce Hathaway interviewed Jaramillo via e mail about the find. Some of the giant crocodiles and turtles that the Titanoboas preyed on weighed 300 pounds. Its hard to imagine even these huge snakes capturing and killing such big crocodiles. How did they do it?\nMaybe they hunted the same way was the largest snakes today, anacondas. Grabbing their prey near the shore, taking it to the water where they have the advantage, quickly wrapping themselves around its body and constricting it to death. It is not so unusual for a snake this big to prey on crocodiles, caimans and turtles current day anacondas do so in the plains of the Orinoco in Colombia and Venezuela. Did these snakes have any natural enemies? How long did they live?\nWe think that their natural enemies attacked eggs and juveniles. The same crocodiles that Titanoboas themselves ate could have preyed on the big snakes eggs and the young Titanoboas. We still dont know anything about their lifespans that is very difficult to know from the fossil record that we have. You say that your findings provide insights into the biological size limits on the evolution of snakes. What are some of the factors involved?\nThe upper growing limits of any organism are conditioned by the resources available, the physiology of each animal and physical forces such as gravity. Ambient temperature is especially important to cold blooded animals thats why the largest snakes on earth live near the Equator. Sixty million years ago, the Cerrejon region in the northeastern part of Colombia, where we found the Titanoboa fossils, was about ten degrees Fahrenheit warmer than today it was a tropical jungle, actually the oldest known rainforest in the Americas. Snakes are cold blooded, so the higher ambient temperatures allowed Titanoboas, which lived 60 million years ago, to grow larger than current day snakes. Can you please tell us more about the big snake fossil excavation process? How did you decide where to dig? About how long did it take to find the fossils? \nWe had been working in the mine for seven years. Cerrejon is the biggest open pit coal mine in the world, so the mine is opening new sites to explore on a regular basis. It took about two years to figure out that the fossils were a snake and collect enough material to be sure about it. Jason Bourque, a student at the University of Florida, was the first one that realized it was a snake we had thought it was a crocodile because of its size. One would think that open pit coal mining would destroy fossils. Apparently not. Why not?\nThe fossils are usually below the coal seams so actually the mining uncovers the fossils for us the mine is an ideal place to look for fossils. The big mining machines remove tons of coal and expose hundreds of square meters of rocks. Thats where the fossils are. Have you only found fossils of backbones? Do you think fossils of Titanoboa heads and mouths and teeth will ever be found? Will there ever be museum skeletal displays of these snakes similar to ones we have for dinosaurs? \nSo far we have only found vertebras and ribs, but we hope that we eventually find a skull and  why not?  a complete skeleton.  We also hope that in the future, the remains of a Titanoboa as well as other fossils from Cerrejon will be displayed in many places. But first, we need to find more specimens, examine them and properly curate them. How did you get involved in paleontology?\nI was born in Colombia, and lived in Bogota until I was in my early 20s. I studied geology at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Bogota, and then did a Masters at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, and a PhD at the University of Florida.  Then I worked for several years with the petroleum industry, and joined the Smithsonian 3.5 years ago. I live in Panama City now, in an area called Clayton, very close to the Panama Canal, surrounded by tropical rainforest. In the mornings I often see toucans, sloths, monkeys, snakes, and even crocodiles. I do not like cold weather. What I like most about my work is being in the field and using fossils to think about the past to understand our present and predict our future. Like Winston Churchill once said The farther backward you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see. Working with fossils gives you a sense of humility, and you appreciate how lucky we are to be on planet Earth. Can you tell us a little about what other projects you, Carlos, are now working on?\nWe are working on the early radiation of flowering plants in the tropics, studying sites in Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Cameroon. Also working on a vast lake that covered the entire Amazon 15 million years ago also working on the new excavations of the Panama Canal to unravel the history of the greatest of all biotic interchanges in earth history the Panama Bridge, when South America and CentralNorth America got together 3.5 million years ago and finally, we want to understand why there is latitudinal diversity gradient lots of species in the tropics, few in temperate regions"}, {"title": "Commercial Collectors and the Plight of Paleontology", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "March 24, 2009", "doc": "In paleontology, amateur can be a dirty word. Even though the term is meant to describe someone with a great affinity for a topic or activity, it all too often is used to signify a lack of knowledge, standards, or other values considered to mark professionals. This is not necessarily true, and the story The Dinosaur Fossil Wars in the new issue of Smithsonian raises the question of how amateur and professional paleontologists differ from commercial collectors. From the very beginning, amateurs have been essential to the development of paleontology. Nineteenth century scholars trained in anatomy and geology like Georges Cuvier, Richard Owen, and William Buckland did much to set the academic foundations of paleontology, but their efforts were matched by tireless fossil collectors like Mary Anning. Not everyone could be a professional academic, but through the 20th century, other fossil hunters like Charles H. Sternberg and Barnum Brown continuned the tradition of careful collection that Anning had started. It is true that Anning, Sternberg, Brown, and other non academic paleontologists sold their finds. The life of a fossil hunter was not an easy one and much of their income came from selling the fossils they found. How is this distinguishable from modern day collectors who dig up bones for the auction block? There are at least two main differences. The first is that fossil hunters like Anning, Sternberg, and Brown were often commissioned by academics to find fossils or they sold those they had already found to museums. Modern commercial collectors do not show the same inclination and are often more concerned with how much money a specimen can make. As the fellows at SV POW remind us, this can keep new and significant specimens beyond the reach of paleontologists. Secondly, non academic paleontologists often keep detailed notes on geology, the position of the skeleton, and other important factors that places fossils in context. It is not enough to simply remove a skeleton from a ground. The very rock it is embedded in is part of its story, and amateur paleontologists often play a crucial role in collecting this sort of data. Commercial collectors do not always show the same concerns and so some of the most important information about a fossil, like where it comes from, might be lost. Non professionals have always been, and will continue to be, very important to the science of paleontology. There is always more work to be done than can be accomplished solely by those who have Ph.D.s and there has been a long tradition of self educated people who have made important contributions to paleontology. The divide these days is not so much between amateurs and professionals as it is between those who care about science and those who want to make a few bucks."}, {"title": "Tianyulong: An Unexpectedly Fuzzy Dinosaur", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "March 20, 2009", "doc": "Over the past decade so many feathered dinosaurs have been discovered that it almost comes as no surprise when a new one is announced. What paleontologists did not expect, however, was to find feathers on a dinosaur that should not have had them. In a paper published this week in Nature paleontologists Zheng Xiao Ting, You Hai Lu, Xu Xing, and Dong Zhi Ming described Tianyulong confuciusi, a small ornithischian dinosaur covered in feather like structures. It takes a little bit of background knowledge to understand why this is so shocking. Dinosaurs can be divided into two large groups the saurischia theropods and sauropods and the ornithischia armored dinosaurs, horned dinosaurs, hadrosaurs, etc.. To date nearly all the dinosaurs with feathers have been coelurosaurs, a group of theropods to which birds also belong, but there is one exception. In 2002 paleontologists announced that they had discovered a specimen of the small ceratopsian dinosaur Psittacosaurus with a plume of bristles jutting from its tail. Since Psittacosaurus was an ornithischian dinosaur it was about as far removed from bird ancestry as a dinosaur could get, so why did have hollow bristly tubes on its tail that resembled early feathers? Careful examination confirmed that the structures were not some strange artifact of preservation like collagen fibers from the decomposing body, but just why this dinosaur had bristles was a puzzle. Enter Tianyulong. This dinosaur from the Early Cretaceous rock of China was a heterodontosaurid, a group of small dinosaurs placed near the base of the ornithischian family tree. What is so special about the first specimen of Tianyulong, though, is that it exhibits three patches of hair like structures very similar to the bristles on the tail of Psittacosaurus. These structures did not branch like feathers and appear to have been more rigid than the feathery dinofuzz of coelurosaurs. The structures possessed by Tianyulong were not feathers, but just what we should call them is now open for suggestion. The big question is whether the bristles on Tianyulong and Psittacosaurus represent the independant evolution of a body covering among ornithischians or whether the bristles were derived from an earlier body covering shared by the common ancestor of ornithischians and saurichians. The feathers of coelurosaurs and the bristles of the ornithischians differ significantly but it is possible that they represent different derivations from a more ancient kind of body covering. The presence of a feathery or hairy body covering in dinosaurs, then, would have been lost in some groups and retained in other groups. The other alternative is that some ornithischian dinosaurs independently evolved a different sort of body covering, perhaps more than once. Which is the correct hypothesis? More research is required to know for sure, but what Tianyulong and Psittacosaurus show is that dinosaurs expressed a wider range of body coverings than we previously appreciated and hint at more amazing discoveries yet to be made."}, {"title": "Book Review: How to Build a Dinosaur", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "March 19, 2009", "doc": "When the film adaptation of the science fiction novel Jurassic Park premiered in the summer of 1993, scientists and the public alike wondered if it was possible to bring dinosaurs back from the dead. It was a tantalizing prospect, but the general consensus was that even if dinosaur DNA could be recovered, there were simply too many obstacles. Cloning a non avian dinosaur appeared to be all but impossible. Yet perhaps there was another way. In the 1993 NOVA program The Real Jurassic Park, paleontologist Robert Bakker suggested that since birds were living dinosaurs, they still carried the genetic code for the formation of teeth, a long tail, and other dinosaurian features. If these genetic switches could be turned back on then scientists could, to a limited extent, reverse engineer a dinosaur. Sixteen years later paleontologist Jack Horner has further developed this hypothesis and, with science writer James Gorman, explained it in his new book How to Build a Dinosaur. When I hear the word paleontologist I almost always think of a flannel clad scientist prying an ancient monster from the rock of a dusty and barren landscape. To some extent this association is accurate, but during the past few decades the discipline of paleontology has diversified to include researchers who specialize in microbiology, development, and genetics. From the structure of dinosaur bone to the controversy over potential Tyrannosaurus rex soft tissue, the first half of the book focuses on how paleontology has been married to laboratory biology. While readers may be itching to get to Horners recipe for a dinosaur, this section is important. It summarizes the emergence of new areas of study within paleontology and confirms that it is unlikely that we will ever clone a dinosaur from preserved tissue. Dinosaurs, as they were from about 230 to 65 million years ago, are lost forever. Only bones and other rare traces of their existence remain. This does not seem like a promising start for a book that claiming to explain how to build a dinosaur, but once the changing nature of paleontology is established, Horner  Gorman set off on another route. The science of evolutionary developmental biology, or evo devo for short, can provide significant clues about major evolutionary changes. This is because evolution is constantly adapting existing structures to new functions. During the evolution of birds, for instance, dinosaurs did not lose their arms only to evolve wings from nothing. Instead the dinosaur forelimb, already feather clad, was modified for flight. It is also true that genes, particularly regulatory genes that organize the formation of the body during development, can be preserved and put to new functions just as parts of skeletal anatomy can. This means that by studying the embryological development of living birds, scientists can find clues as to how the bodies of some dinosaurs were formed. By tweaking the development of a chicken embryo they might be able to create a creature with a long tail, clawed hands, and teeth, just as Bakker suggested in 1993. The precise details of how this could be done are still largely unknown, Horner has no recipe to share, but the hypothesis that it could be done has merit. Wired magazine has an interview with Horner in which he proposes that by switching certain genes on or off during the development of a chicken, you could create something that looked more like Velociraptor and less like something destined to be made into deep fried nuggets. If these experiment were successful, the resulting creature would not be a true dinosaur it would simply be a genetically manipulated chicken that would appear dinosaur like. It would mostly be informative about the small maniraptoran dinosaurs from which birds evolved and would be less informative for the sauropods and the vast array of ornithischian dinosaurs hadrosaurs, stegosaurs, ceratopsians, etc.. Horner  Gorman readily recognize this, and it is just as well. The goal of the project is not to create a living dinosaur but to understand how evolution works. If a creature could be created that revealed how the genetic code for ancient characteristics has been retained and re activated, the animal would be a striking illustration of evolution. More than that, by bringing these traits out paleontologists may be able to understand the details of how birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs. The importance of How to Build a Dinosaur does not lie in Horners wish to create a dinochicken. That makes up only a small part of the book. Instead the slim volume indicates how paleontology is becoming more of an interdisciplinary science where studies of development and genetics are just as important as fossilized bones. It remains to be seen whether Horner will be able to open a Jurassic Barnyard, but that is not the point. The bodies of living things hold records of the past just as the strata of the earth do, and when both lines of evidence are studied together scientists can finally begin to answer evolutionary questions that have puzzled researchers for decades."}, {"title": "Hesperonychus: A Tiny Killer", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "March 17, 2009", "doc": "If you visited what is now Alberta, Canada 75 million years ago, you would have to beware of some formidable predators. The large tyrannosaurids Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus prowled the landscape while the smaller sickle clawed killers Dromaeosaurus and Saurornitholestes stalked their prey in the forest. You might be excused, then, if you missed a smaller feathered predator that weighed about as much as a domestic chicken and was named Hesperonychus. Announced by paleontologists Nicholas Longrich and Philip Currie this week in the journal PNAS, Hesperonychus is the smallest predatory dinosaur yet known from North America even smaller than the termite eating Albertonykus, which Currie and Longrich described last year. It still would have been quite large compared to the mammals of its day, however, and it may have been the scourge of our ancient relatives. This fits with the hypothesis that dinosaur predation on mammals kept mammals small, but as Longrich and Currie point out, it could also mean that the occupation of niches by mammals kept dinosaurs from becoming much smaller. During the Mesozoic, the time when non avian dinosaurs flourished, there were no large mammals. One of the biggest was Repenomamus, which was about the size of a small dog and lived during the Cretaceous. It was large enough to eat some baby dinosaurs which fossil evidence has shown it did but this was unusual. Most mammals were smaller and ate seeds, insects, and fruit. This means that if there were dinosaurs smaller than Hesperonychus they may have come into competition with mammals for food and places to live in the forest. Rather than coming into such direct competition for resources with mammals it seems that the smallest of theropod dinosaurs were just large enough to see mammals as food. What is even more surprising is that Hesperonychus does not fit in with any other maniraptoran dinosaurs from North America. When Longrich and Currie studied its bones to determine what kind of dinosaur it was, they found that it was most closely related to the microraptorine dinosaurs from China. This group of feathered dinosaurs, which includes Microraptor and Sinornithosaurus, had not been found in North America before. Not only that, but Hesperonychus is about 45 million years younger than the oldest members of this group in Asia. Therefore it extends the range of the microraptorine dinosaurs over both time and geography, hinting at other tantalizing finds yet to be disinterred from the rock."}, {"title": "Getting a Handle on Theropod Arms", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "March 6, 2009", "doc": "Earlier this week a new paper in the journal PLoS One reported a set of fossilized impressions that showed how theropod dinosaurs held their hands. Scientists were able to confirm that theropods palms faced each other. But paleo artist Michael Skrepnick reminded me of another trackway that confirmed the mobility of theropod hands. At the 2002 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting, paleontologists reported on a set of early Cretaceous about 146 to 100 million years old tracks found in British Columbia made by a large theropod dinosaur. The tracks showed that it was walking at a uniform speed, but for some unknown reason the theropod raked the ground with both of its hands, making two sets of slash marks. To do so it would have had to have held its hands palms downward, as shown in the wonderful illustration by Skrepnick. The findings of these studies are not mutually exclusive. The neutral position, or the position at rest, of theropod hands was so the palms were facing each other, as shown in the PLoS One paper. Theropod hands were not locked in this position, however, and the earlier 2002 report reveals that they did have enough of a range of motion so that they could hold their arms with elbows out and palms down. Both studies show why trackways can be so important to paleontology they are snapshots of anatomy and behavior preserved in stone."}, {"title": "Blog Carnival Edition #5 \u2014 Unbelievable Organisms, Titanoboa, Animatronics and More!", "author": "Mark Strauss", "date": "February 27, 2009", "doc": "Believe it or not At Catalogue of Organisms, Christopher Taylor serves up a list of the ten Most Unbelievable Organisms Evah The winning dinosaur on the list is Argentinosaurus huinculensis Theres no other way to say it sauropods were just stupidly huge.

A new discovery, however, shows that some were even stranger than the weird genera already known. Yesterday a new paper in Proceedings of the Royal Society B by Octavio Mateus, Susannah Maidment, and Nicolai A. Christiansen announced that Miragaia, a long necked stegosaur, lived about 150 million years ago in what is now Portugal. Most stegosaurs had relatively short necks for their body size. Miragaia was different. It had 17 neck vertebrae, eight more than earlier ornithischian dinosaurs from which the stegosaurs evolved. This is especially interesting because some of its close relatives, like Stegosaurus, had an increased number of neck vertebrae even though their necks were shorter than that of Miragaia. This suggests that the evolution of the long neck in Miragaia was allowed by evolutionary changes that were already underway among stegosaurs for some time. To compare Miragaia with the long necked sauropod dinosaurs like Apatosaurus, you need to go down to the bones. There is not just one way a long neck can evolve. One way, seen in many sauropods, occurred through the lengthening individual vertebrae. The long neck of Miragaia, by contrast, evolved through the addition of vertebrae to the neck. Some of these were borrowed from vertebrae in line behind the neck region, meaning that they once formed part of the upper back but evolved to function like neck vertebrae. This, too, is seen in some sauropod dinosaurs, but how did it happen? The authors propose that a well known kind of regulatory gene important to organizing the body plan of an animal, called a hox gene, may have triggered the variation that eventually allowed back vertebrae to become neck vertebrae. Unfortunately we cannot test this directly because we do not have preserved Miragaia DNA, but it is an intriguing hypothesis. Another perplexing question is what selective pressures led long necked stegosaurs to evolve. The researchers entertained two possibilities that it was the result of sexual selection or that it allowed stegosaurs with slightly longer necks to browse from a wider array of foliage. Further study will be required to determine whether either of these ideas is correct or if there is some other cause paleontologists have not thought of yet. Regardless of what the answer turns out to be I am looking forward to the debate and discussion this amazing new fossil stirs up."}, {"title": "Building a Better Dinosaur", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "February 19, 2009", "doc": "We all know dinosaurs were big, but how massive were they, exactly? A complete skeleton can give scientists a good idea of the height, length, and general size of a dinosaur, but figuring out the mass carried by those skeletal frames has been a difficult question to answer. A study just published in the journal PLoS, though, applies a new technique to this quandary. Using LiDar scanning techniques, researchers from the University of Manchester created virtual three dimensional models of the dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus, Acrocanthosaurus, Struthiomimus, and Edmontosaurus. This not only digitally preserved the skeletons, but it also allowed researchers to play with the skeletons on the computer without risking damage to any of the precious fossils. In addition, this approach allowed the scientists to retain the appropriate scale for each skeleton  in the past, paleontologists have had to use scale models due to the impracticality of building and running tests on life size dinosaur reproductions. This way the scientists could test different scenarios on different models, inserting air sacs and changing various aspects of the model to see what would happen. Doing the same with a life sized mock up of Tyrannosaurus would be difficult and dangerous. So what did the scientists find? By playing with different muscle arrangements, they found that the weights of the dinosaurs were often similar to what other researchers had determined using older methods. Even so, there was some variability in the new models that left room for different interpretations. There was no one set mass arrived at for any dinosaur   the researchers could make their dinosaurs skinny or chunky, and because many dinosaurs had holes for air sacs that lightened their bones, determining a definitive mass for a single dinosaur was complicated. What was more consistent across the different models was the placement of the center of mass of the animal in front of and below the hips. This might seem like a minor point but it is important for reconstructing how dinosaurs might have moved and how fast they could have run. There is a lot to dig into in the new paper especially if you like crunching numbers, but it reflects how technology is being used to gain a better understanding of dinosaurs. Field work can be exciting, but once the bones are back in the lab, paleontologists are using all sorts of new techniques to get a closer look at the lives of dinosaurs than was possible before."}, {"title": "Abel\u2019s Tyrannosaurus", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "February 6, 2009", "doc": "Perhaps no illustrations of Tyrannosaurus rex are as famous as the paintings of it made by Charles R. Knight at the beginning of the 20th century. Even though they are outdated, Knights paintings are still widely reprinted and cherished for their artistic detail. There are plenty of other illustrations from when Tyrannosaurus was still new to science, though, and the other day I stumbled across one I had never seen before. In 1930, the Austrian paleontologist Othenio Abel published a paper on Tyrannosaurus in which he included a photograph and drawing of a model of the famous predator. Many dinosaur sculptures have featured the dinosaurs striking a pose by themselves, but Abels Tyrannosaurus is seen tearing the flesh from an Edmontosaurus skeleton modeled after the famous Trachodon mummy.

Triceratops", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "February 5, 2009", "doc": "Every dinosaur enthusiast can immediately recognize Triceratops by its bony frill and three horns, but what did it actually use those horns for? The horns might have been used for defense against predators, for display, in combat between rival Triceratops, or even all three, but it has been difficult to find ways to test these ideas. In a new study published in the journal PLoS One, however, researchers found some tell tale clues of ancient combat. In 2004 paleontologist Andrew Farke, who writes the blog The Open Source Paleontologist, used scale models of Triceratops to see if two fighting individuals could effectively lock horns with each other. The models suggested that they could, but Farke needed more evidence that these dinosaurs were actually exhibiting these behaviors. To find these clues Farke teamed up with his colleagues Ewan Wolff and Darren Tanke and looked at the differences between the skulls of Triceratops and another kid of horned dinosaur, Centrosaurus. The scientists found that both genera of dinosaurs had bone lesions around their frills, but Triceratops had significantly more on the squamosal bone which makes up the base of the frill. There was no sign that these lesions were caused by disease or by the attack of a predator, but they were consistent with the idea that individual Triceratops fought each other by locking horns. Centrosaurus did not have these pathologies, then, because it did not have large brow horns to fight with. If individual Centrosaurus fought each other they would be doing so in a different way. These dinosaurs still may have used their horns for defense and display, but in Triceratops, at least, there is now evidence that horns played an important role in intraspecies conflict. As Farke notes in his own summary of the paper, this research raises some interesting questions. Centrosaurus is thought to have evolved from an ancestor with Triceratops like brow horns. If so, the shift in horn arrangement may have been reinforced by a change in one on one dinosaur combat that resulted in fewer injuries."}, {"title": "Austroraptor: a Giant, Sickle-Clawed Killer", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "December 19, 2008", "doc": "When Jurassic Park was released into theaters, scientists were quick to point out that the film featured super sized Velociraptor. Even the largest of the dromaeosaurs then known, like Deinonychus, were puny compared to their on screen cousins. The same year that the film was released, however, the first remains of an enormous, 21 foot long dromaeosaur named Utahraptor were recovered in, you guessed it, Utah. Velociraptor may have been small, but there were giants in its family tree. Now another raptor, just as enormous, named Austroraptor has been announced in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Even though many dromaeosaurs are known from the Northern Hemisphere, primarily North America and Asia, they did have some odd cousins that lived in what is now South America. A particular group of these Southern Hemisphere raptors, the Unenlagiinae, had very long snouts and relatively short arms compared to other dromaeosaurs, and Austroraptor falls into this strange group. Even though much of the skeleton is still missing, the recovered skull, leg, vertebrae, and arm bones have told paleontologists a lot about this narrow snouted predator, which lived 70 million years ago. Many dromaeosaurs have very long arms, but the humerus of Austroraptor indicates that it had shorter arms more similar in relative size to Allosaurus or Carcharodontosaurus. This is consistent with a trend seen widely among carnivorous theropods as bodies get bigger, arms get shorter. The leg bones of Austroraptor are also strikingly large, and this also has to do with scaling. Larger animals require thicker and stronger bones to hold themselves up Austroraptor is not simply a scaled up version of its smaller relatives like Buitreraptor. The discovery of Austroraptor has revealed that South America was a center of diversification for predatory dinosaurs. Not only does it illustrate the variety of dromaeosaurs present in South America during the Cretaceous, but it shows that these dinosaurs grew to large sizes and probably came into competition with other predators like the Abelisaurids, theropods like the recently announced Skorpiovenator. South America during the Cretaceous was definitely a dangerous place to live."}, {"title": "Dinosaur Blog Carnival Edition #2, Part I", "author": "Mark Strauss", "date": "December 1, 2008", "doc": "New Blogs on the Block The paleosphere offers a hearty welcome to Jeffrey Martz, a self described underemployed vertebrate paleontologist who has started blogging over at Paleo Errata.

Huxley was carving a goose for a holiday feast when he noticed something peculiar. The anatomy of the cooked bird was very similar to that of some dinosaurs, and soon afterwards Huxley proposed that dinosaurs were the animals from which birds evolved. Its a great story, but unfortunately, it isnt true. Huxley had been teaching his anatomy students that reptiles and birds were very similar anatomically as early as 1863, but he wasnt thinking in evolutionary terms. His conception had more to do with anatomical groundplans birds and dinosaurs shared a number of skeletal similarities. It was only after he read the German embryologist Ernst Haeckels Generelle Morphologie, published in 1866, that Huxley started to go beyond similarities and think about how birds might have evolved from reptiles. About this time Huxley visited the museum at Oxford under the care of the geologist John Phillips. While the pair examined the skeleton of Megalosaurus there, Huxley noticed that what had been part of the dinosaurs shoulder was really part of the hip. Once the bones were rearranged, the dinosaur seemed a lot more avian than the elephant like creatures the anatomist Richard Owen had conceived. This fit well in Huxleys new concept of what the dinosaurs looked like and what they were related to. Huxley produced a slew of papers on the topic, but he did not go so far as to say that birds evolved from any known kind of dinosaur. He thought that dinosaurs like Compsognathus were proxies for what bird ancestors might look like. The fossils that had been recovered by his time revealed the general way birds had evolved, even if direct ancestor descendant relationships were still unknown. Even if Huxley was not inspired by a Thanksgiving turkey or Christmas goose, however, the apocryphal story has inspired some paleontologists to use their dining room tables as a classroom. When their families sit down to a holiday dinner, these scientists point out the skeletal evidence that allows everyone at the table to say they had dinosaur for dinner. Oh, and Happy Thanksgiving"}, {"title": "What Good are Dinosaurs?", "author": "Riley Black", "date": "November 20, 2008", "doc": "Among paleontologists, there is sometimes a feeling that dinosaur research is overhyped. Later this month at the Grant Zoology museum of University College London, paleontologist Mark Carnall will deliver a talk called Dinosaurs are Pointless. The description of the lecture describes dinosaur documentaries as hackneyed, and claims that dinosaur specialists have a Freudian obsession with finding the biggest dinosaurs. The attention given dinosaurs, according to the announcement, is disproportionate to their scientific value, and Carnall will attempt to put dinosaurs in their proper place. It is true that dinosaurs have certainly had more than their fair share of media attention, but I must defend them. Dinosaurs are far from pointless. When dinosaurs were first scientifically described during the first half of the 19th century, for instance, the presence of such animals, along with the flying pterosaurs and ancient marine reptiles, indicated a world much older than previously thought and challenged religious ideas about the history of the earth. While the science of geology was already casting off religious strictures, dinosaurs helped convince people that the world had changed dramatically over long periods of time. Then, as more dinosaurs were discovered, their disappearance became more troubling. How could such a diverse array of animals disappear entirely? During the 1980s, debates about the meteor that struck the earth 65 million years ago provided a compelling explanation for the disappearance of the dinosaurs. Contemplating their extinction helped motivate more philosophical considerations about our own extinction and global nuclear war. Even more recently, the flood of feathered dinosaurs from China has provided some of the most striking evidence for evolution ever found in the fossil record. During the middle of the 20th century, some scientists felt that paleontology had little to offer the study of evolution. But in the past 20 years dinosaur specialists have ably demonstrated that the study of dinosaurs and evolution are inseparable. Is a fragmentary dinosaur skeleton especially informative in fine tuned studies of ancient ecology? Perhaps not, but the scientific value of dinosaurs should not be tarnished because of their popularity. They have been important to scientists studying evolution, extinction, and the history of life on earth, not to mention their role as ambassadors for science. It would be wonderful if members of the public took a greater interest in small Mesozoic mammals or ancient insects, but for better or worse dinosaurs have grabbed the imagination of the public in a unique way. They are modern day dragons that not only terrify, but educate."}, {"title": "Candidates and Constituents Visualize Science in 2008", "author": "Hugh Powell", "date": "October 8, 2008", "doc": "The 2008 electoral campaign has now brought us three debates.

Soft tissue discovered deep inside a Tyrannosaurus rex legbone may be a recent biofilm what you might call scunge if you found it on a dishrag, not remnants of the Toothy One after all. Thats the suggestion of a team led by Thomas Kaye, writing in the scientific journal PLOS One. \u200b Avid Smithsoniacs and dino fans may remember bits and pieces of this story. In 2005, paleontologists Mary Schweitzer and Jack Horner were stuffing a T. rex femur inside a too small helicopter on their way home. They cracked the bone in half to make it fit, and Schweitzer noticed a goopy residue on the 65 million year old insides of the bone see the Smithsonian story. Then this April, Schweitzer and her colleagues isolated a protein called collagen from the sample, analyzed it, and found striking similarities to the collagen of modern birds. Kayes contradictory opinion comes from using an electron microscope to peer at similar residues he found in different fossils. Studying fossils of 17 dinosaur and mammal species, Kaye and his team saw evidence of biofilms, or slime left behind by bacteria that grew on the bone long after the dinosaurs death. Where Schweitzers group described the remains of red blood cells, Kayes team thought they were seeing iron rich structures routinely built by bacteria. The iron content and the structures characteristic shape might have made them look like red blood cells in some analyses, Kaye suggested. Kaye found these structures time and again in his samples   even in a fossilized shell, which never would have contained blood at all. Worst of all, carbon dating suggested the biofilm was as recent as 1960. Of course, theres still the matter of the collagens similarity to chickens and ostriches   a detail Schweitzer was quick to point out to reporters. And Kaye didnt sample the T. rex in question, leaving open the chance that Schweitzers find was the genuine article. Personally, Im leaning toward believing in the extraordinary. At least until the collagen results are explained I mean, can anyone tell me if bacteria even make collagen? Either way, its fascinating to listen to the well constructed arguments on both sides.

Since last year, a Japanese probe called SELENE has been taking thousands of high resolution images of Tycho.

In these days of Google Earth and computer rendered fighting pandas, it can be difficult to appreciate reality as anything more than a poor approximation of a movie. But the cliffs, plains, and pinnacles sweeping past in the video really are up there, rotating in space and baking under the glare of the Sun. That pinprick in Tychos center, for example, is a mile high mountain range complete with jagged peaks, old remains of landslides, and what looks like a totally manageable hike up one side.

This means that one day, paleontologist artists may have to stop dreaming up rosy purples and outlandish greens to clothe their dinosaurs in remember Mark Wittons lovely pterosaurs a few posts ago?. Is there any ephemeral detail that scientists cant discover about long dead creatures through clever chemistry? Theyve figured out the diet of an extinct seabird, learned about Aztec travels from records in exhumed teeth, and now theyve put back together the stripes on a 100 million year old bird. The evidence sat in front of them for years in the form of a powdery residue on some fossils. It was long thought to be the meaningless remains of carrion eating bacteria, but Yale graduate student Jakob Vinthers electron microscope revealed the powder looked exactly like the pigment bearing sacs that occur on modern day feathers. Nowadays, those sacs are full of melanin which give birds colors ranging from black to russet brown. Though the work was done on fossil birds, the scientists report that similar residues from dinosaur scales and the hair of ancient mammals may reveal their colors as well.

With the crew now together, we head out from the AW to our first camp near Shell, a small hamlet about 5 miles away. The land we camp on is owned by a very generous couple, the Manuels, whose family has lived in the Shell area since the early 1900s. Their family has assisted paleontologists working in the area for almost a century now and the Smithsonian paleontologists have personally known the family for more than a decade. Inside the camp, we have a small RV, a gas grill, lawn chairs, a view of the Big Horn Mountains and an air conditioned house with showers and real toilets less than two minutes away. It is almost too comfortable. Suffice it to say, we arent completely submerged in the camping experience quite yet. On our first day in the field, we surface collect a type of deposit called a microsite at Ostroms Beach. In microsites, thousands of small fossils are concentrated in one place. The rock layer we\u00a0 look at is called the Cloverly Formation, from the Early Cretaceous about 120 million years ago. Although we dont discover any new dinosaurs, we find several small crocodile and theropod teeth, as well as bits of bone fragments and some large pieces of turtle plastron, which is the flat underside of the shell. Just behind the microsite, in whats known as the bowl, we find larger, but still fragmented fossils that dont have very much scientific value because so little information can be derived from the fragments. Erosion can actually be a big help in this line of work. Matt still visits every year in case anything new and interesting is uncovered by nature. John Ostrom was a famous paleontologist from Yale University, and he was the first to collect from this site back in the 1960s, explains Matt.\u00a0 His work here was very important, and so we decided to name the site after him. After leaving the bowl we take a look at a very large exposure of dinosaur tracks. The footprints are millions of years old and represent multiple dinosaurs walking along what was once a beach. The Sundance Formation, where this tracksite is located, was previously thought to be a much deeper ocean. However, these footprints disprove that idea and indicate the area was actually much shallower. Ancient footprints bring alive the fact that the fossils we find were once living breathing animals, and approximately 160 million years ago, several dinosaurs walked along this beach.\u00a0 Were they looking for food, or walking to a watering hole?\u00a0 We may never know, but that event on that day in the Jurassic has been preserved for millions of years, says Wesley Hunt. On our way back to camp, we stop at another part of the Sundance Formation and pick up a few belemnites. Belemnites are a very common marine invertebrate fossil in this locality. They are cephalopods mollusks, very similar to the modern squid. The bullet shaped shells we found are part of what originally gave the animal internal structure.

Most of the kilometer long path to the site is barely wide enough for one person to walk comfortably, so we walk one by one to get there. The trek is worth our while, as the hardest site to get to seems to be the most fruitful. Just from initial surface collecting we find several theropod teeth, including a Deinonychus tooth.\u00a0 We also find crocodile teeth, pieces of turtle shell, and a couple of ankylosaur teeth, among other things.

All of the sites on which we prospect are government land, but because a lot of the property in this area is private, it is difficult to get where we want to go without driving over someones land. Asking permission permission every time we need to cross anyones property requires a lot of patience, but with a little bit of charm and a lot of driving from house to house and into town and back, we are allowed to use most of the roads we need to access. Prospecting is a hit or miss venture. We either find something or we dont, more often the latter. But it is the only way to discover new sites and there are many outcrops that are still unexplored. We happen to get lucky on our first day of prospecting After walking around for a few hours and finding nothing, Ruth notices a bit of bone fragment on the ground in a spot everyone had missed. After a wide inspection of the area, we find more bone that is determined to be from a sauropod. Thus, the Sylvia Antoinette site named after Ruths daughter is born. This expedition is uncommonly successful so far. Out of the three outcrops we visited, bone is found in seven new sites. In this year alone, weve found more Cloverly sites than in the previous four years combined, Dr, Matthew Carrano notes. When we dont find fossils, we discover plenty of other ways to entertain ourselves on the outcrop. Things that arent interesting at all before suddenly become fascinating. We find ourselves more engrossed by pretty rocks and dead mammal bones than is necessarily healthy.

Ruth expresses my own feelings so clearly, Im glad weve begun our journey home, but Im going to miss the thrill of holding a bit of history in my hands. I certainly never expected to be involved with this kind of work, but it has brought me a much deeper understanding of paleontology and science. I dont know if I would do it again, but I feel so lucky to have been a part of this team and this adventure."}, {"title": "The Great Human Migration", "author": "Guy Gugliotta", "date": "July 2008", "doc": "Seventy seven thousand years ago, a craftsman sat in a cave in a limestone cliff overlooking the rocky coast of what is now the Indian Ocean. It was a beautiful spot, a workshop with a glorious natural picture window, cooled by a sea breeze in summer, warmed by a small fire in winter. The sandy cliff top above was covered with a white flowering shrub that one distant day would be known as blombos and give this place the name Blombos Cave. The man picked up a piece of reddish brown stone about three inches long that heor she, no one knowshad polished. With a stone point, he etched a geometric design in the flat surfacesimple crosshatchings framed by two parallel lines with a third line down the middle. Today the stone offers no clue to its original purpose. It could have been a religious object, an ornament or just an ancient doodle. But to see it is to immediately recognize it as something only a person could have made. Carving the stone was a very human thing to do. The scratchings on this piece of red ocher mudstone are the oldest known example of an intricate design made by a human being. The ability to create and communicate using such symbols, says Christopher Henshilwood, leader of the team that discovered the stone, is an unambiguous marker of modern humans, one of the characteristics that separate us from any other species, living or extinct. Henshilwood, an archaeologist at Norways University of Bergen and the University of the Witwatersrand, in South Africa, found the carving on land owned by his grandfather, near the southern tip of the African continent. Over the years, he had identified and excavated nine sites on the property, none more than 6,500 years old, and was not at first interested in this cliffside cave a few miles from the South African town of Still Bay. What he would find there, however, would change the way scientists think about the evolution of modern humans and the factors that triggered perhaps the most important event in human prehistory, when Homo sapiens left their African homeland to colonize the world. This great migration brought our species to a position of world dominance that it has never relinquished and signaled the extinction of whatever competitors remainedNeanderthals in Europe and Asia, some scattered pockets of Homo erectus in the Far East and, if scholars ultimately decide they are in fact a separate species, some diminutive people from the Indonesian island of Flores see Were Hobbits Human?. When the migration was complete, Homo sapiens was the lastand onlyman standing. Even today researchers argue about what separates modern humans from other, extinct hominids. Generally speaking, moderns tend to be a slimmer, taller breed gracile, in scientific parlance, rather than robust, like the heavy boned Neanderthals, their contemporaries for perhaps 15,000 years in ice age Eurasia. The modern and Neanderthal brains were about the same size, but their skulls were shaped differently the newcomers skulls were flatter in back than the Neanderthals, and they had prominent jaws and a straight forehead without heavy brow ridges. Lighter bodies may have meant that modern humans needed less food, giving them a competitive advantage during hard times. The moderns behaviors were also different. Neanderthals made tools, but they worked with chunky flakes struck from large stones. Modern humans stone tools and weapons usually featured elongated, standardized, finely crafted blades. Both species hunted and killed the same large mammals, including deer, horses, bison and wild cattle. But moderns sophisticated weaponry, such as throwing spears with a variety of carefully wrought stone, bone and antler tips, made them more successful. And the tools may have kept them relatively safe fossil evidence shows Neanderthals suffered grievous injuries, such as gorings and bone breaks, probably from hunting at close quarters with short, stone tipped pikes and stabbing spears. Both species had ritualsNeanderthals buried their deadand both made ornaments and jewelry. But the moderns produced their artifacts with a frequency and expertise that Neanderthals never matched. And Neanderthals, as far as we know, had nothing like the etching at Blombos Cave, let alone the bone carvings, ivory flutes and, ultimately, the mesmerizing cave paintings and rock art that modern humans left as snapshots of their world. When the study of human origins intensified in the 20th century, two main theories emerged to explain the archaeological and fossil record one, known as the multi regional hypothesis, suggested that a species of human ancestor dispersed throughout the globe, and modern humans evolved from this predecessor in several different locations. The other, out of Africa theory, held that modern humans evolved in Africa for many thousands of years before they spread throughout the rest of the world. In the 1980s, new tools completely changed the kinds of questions that scientists could answer about the past. By analyzing DNA in living human populations, geneticists could trace lineages backward in time. These analyses have provided key support for the out of Africa theory. Homo sapiens, this new evidence has repeatedly shown, evolved in Africa, probably around 200,000 years ago. The first DNA studies of human evolution didnt use the DNA in a cells nucleuschromosomes inherited from both father and motherbut a shorter strand of DNA contained in the mitochondria, which are energy producing structures inside most cells. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited only from the mother. Conveniently for scientists, mitochondrial DNA has a relatively high mutation rate, and mutations are carried along in subsequent generations. By comparing mutations in mitochondrial DNA among todays populations, and making assumptions about how frequently they occurred, scientists can walk the genetic code backward through generations, combining lineages in ever larger, earlier branches until they reach the evolutionary trunk. At that point in human history, which scientists have calculated to be about 200,000 years ago, a woman existed whose mitochondrial DNA was the source of the mitochondrial DNA in every person alive today. That is, all of us are her descendants. Scientists call her Eve. This is something of a misnomer, for Eve was neither the first modern human nor the only woman alive 200,000 years ago. But she did live at a time when the modern human population was smallabout 10,000 people, according to one estimate. She is the only woman from that time to have an unbroken lineage of daughters, though she is neither our only ancestor nor our oldest ancestor. She is, instead, simply our most recent common ancestor, at least when it comes to mitochondria. And Eve, mitochondrial DNA backtracking showed, lived in Africa. Subsequent, more sophisticated analyses using DNA from the nucleus of cells have confirmed these findings, most recently in a study this year comparing nuclear DNA from 938 people from 51 parts of the world. This research, the most comprehensive to date, traced our common ancestor to Africa and clarified the ancestries of several populations in Europe and the Middle East. While DNA studies have revolutionized the field of paleoanthropology, the story is not as straightforward as people think, says University of Pennsylvania geneticist Sarah A. Tishkoff. If the rates of mutation, which are largely inferred, are not accurate, the migration timetable could be off by thousands of years. To piece together humankinds great migration, scientists blend DNA analysis with archaeological and fossil evidence to try to create a coherent wholeno easy task. A disproportionate number of artifacts and fossils are from Europewhere researchers have been finding sites for well over 100 yearsbut there are huge gaps elsewhere. Outside the Near East there is almost nothing from Asia, maybe ten dots you could put on a map, says Texas AM University anthropologist Ted Goebel. As the gaps are filled, the story is likely to change, but in broad outline, todays scientists believe that from their beginnings in Africa, the modern humans went first to Asia between 80,000 and 60,000 years ago. By 45,000 years ago, or possibly earlier, they had settled Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia. The moderns entered Europe around 40,000 years ago, probably via two routes from Turkey along the Danube corridor into eastern Europe, and along the Mediterranean coast. By 35,000 years ago, they were firmly established in most of the Old World. The Neanderthals, forced into mountain strongholds in Croatia, the Iberian Peninsula, the Crimea and elsewhere, would become extinct 25,000 years ago. Finally, around 15,000 years ago, humans crossed from Asia to North America and from there to South America. Africa is relatively rich in the fossils of human ancestors who lived millions of years ago see timeline, opposite. Lush, tropical lake country at the dawn of human evolution provided one congenial living habitat for such hominids as Australopithecus afarensis. Many such places are dry today, which makes for a congenial exploration habitat for paleontologists. Wind erosion exposes old bones that were covered in muck millions of years ago. Remains of early Homo sapiens, by contrast, are rare, not only in Africa, but also in Europe. One suspicion is that the early moderns on both continents did notin contrast to Neanderthalsbury their dead, but either cremated them or left them to decompose in the open. In 2003, a team of anthropologists reported the discovery of three unusual skullstwo adults and a childat Herto, near the site of an ancient freshwater lake in northeast Ethiopia. The skulls were between 154,000 and 160,000 years old and had modern characteristics, but with some archaic features. Even now Im a little hesitant to call them anatomically modern, says team leader Tim White, from the University of California at Berkeley. These are big, robust people, who havent quite evolved into modern humans. Yet they are so close you wouldnt want to give them a different species name. The Herto skulls fit with the DNA analysis suggesting that modern humans evolved some 200,000 years ago. But they also raised questions. There were no other skeletal remains at the site although there was evidence of butchered hippopotamuses, and all three skulls, which were nearly complete except for jawbones, showed cut markssigns of scraping with stone tools. It appeared that the skulls had been deliberately detached from their skeletons and defleshed. In fact, part of the childs skull was highly polished. It is hard to argue that this is not some kind of mortuary ritual, White says. Even more provocative were discoveries reported last year. In a cave at Pinnacle Point in South Africa, a team led by Arizona State University paleoanthropologist Curtis Marean found evidence that humans 164,000 years ago were eating shellfish, making complex tools and using red ocher pigmentall modern human behaviors. The shellfish remainsof mussels, periwinkles, barnacles and other mollusksindicated that humans were exploiting the sea as a food source at least 40,000 years earlier than previously thought. The first archaeological evidence of a human migration out of Africa was found in the caves of Qafzeh and Skhul, in present day Israel. These sites, initially discovered in the 1930s, contained the remains of at least 11 modern humans. Most appeared to have been ritually buried. Artifacts at the site, however, were simple hand axes and other Neanderthal style tools. At first, the skeletons were thought to be 50,000 years oldmodern humans who had settled in the Levant on their way to Europe. But in 1989, new dating techniques showed them to be 90,000 to 100,000 years old, the oldest modern human remains ever found outside Africa. But this excursion appears to be a dead end there is no evidence that these moderns survived for long, much less went on to colonize any other parts of the globe. They are therefore not considered to be a part of the migration that followed 10,000 or 20,000 years later. Intriguingly, 70,000 year old Neanderthal remains have been found in the same region. The moderns, it would appear, arrived first, only to move on, die off because of disease or natural catastrophe orpossiblyget wiped out. If they shared territory with Neanderthals, the more robust species may have outcompeted them here. You may be anatomically modern and display modern behaviors, says paleoanthropologist Nicholas J. Conard of Germanys University of T\u00fcbingen, but apparently it wasnt enough. At that point the two species are on pretty equal footing. It was also at this point in history, scientists concluded, that the Africans ceded Asia to the Neanderthals. Then, about 80,000 years ago, says Blombos archaeologist Henshilwood, modern humans entered a dynamic period of innovation. The evidence comes from such South African cave sites as Blombos, Klasies River, Diepkloof and Sibudu. In addition to the ocher carving, the Blombos Cave yielded perforated ornamental shell beadsamong the worlds first known jewelry. Pieces of inscribed ostrich eggshell turned up at Diepkloof. Hafted points at Sibudu and elsewhere hint that the moderns of southern Africa used throwing spears and arrows. Fine grained stone needed for careful workmanship had been transported from up to 18 miles away, which suggests they had some sort of trade. Bones at several South African sites showed that humans were killing eland, springbok and even seals. At Klasies River, traces of burned vegetation suggest that the ancient hunter gatherers may have figured out that by clearing land, they could encourage quicker growth of edible roots and tubers. The sophisticated bone tool and stoneworking technologies at these sites were all from roughly the same time periodbetween 75,000 and 55,000 years ago. Virtually all of these sites had piles of seashells. Together with the much older evidence from the cave at Pinnacle Point, the shells suggest that seafood may have served as a nutritional trigger at a crucial point in human history, providing the fatty acids that modern humans needed to fuel their outsize brains This is the evolutionary driving force, says University of Cape Town archaeologist John Parkington. It is sucking people into being more cognitively aware, faster wired, faster brained, smarter. Stanford University paleoanthropologist Richard Klein has long argued that a genetic mutation at roughly this point in human history provoked a sudden increase in brainpower, perhaps linked to the onset of speech. Did new technology, improved nutrition or some genetic mutation allow modern humans to explore the world? Possibly, but other scholars point to more mundane factors that may have contributed to the exodus from Africa. A recent DNA study suggests that massive droughts before the great migration split Africas modern human population into small, isolated groups and may have even threatened their extinction. Only after the weather improved were the survivors able to reunite, multiply and, in the end, emigrate. Improvements in technology may have helped some of them set out for new territory. Or cold snaps may have lowered sea level and opened new land bridges. Whatever the reason, the ancient Africans reached a watershed. They were ready to leave, and they did. DNA evidence suggests the original exodus involved anywhere from 1,000 to 50,000 people. Scientists do not agree on the time of the departuresometime more recently than 80,000 years agoor the departure point, but most now appear to be leaning away from the Sinai, once the favored location, and toward a land bridge crossing what today is the Bab el Mandeb Strait separating Djibouti from the Arabian Peninsula at the southern end of the Red Sea. From there, the thinking goes, migrants could have followed a southern route eastward along the coast of the Indian Ocean. It could have been almost accidental, Henshilwood says, a path of least resistance that did not require adaptations to different climates, topographies or diet. The migrants path never veered far from the sea, departed from warm weather or failed to provide familiar food, such as shellfish and tropical fruit. Tools found at Jwalapuram, a 74,000 year old site in southern India, match those used in Africa from the same period. Anthropologist Michael Petraglia of the University of Cambridge, who led the dig, says that although no human fossils have been found to confirm the presence of modern humans at Jwalapuram, the tools suggest it is the earliest known settlement of modern humans outside of Africa except for the dead enders at Israels Qafzeh and Skhul sites. And thats about all the physical evidence there is for tracking the migrants early progress across Asia. To the south, the fossil and archaeological record is clearer and shows that modern humans reached Australia and Papua New Guineathen part of the same landmassat least 45,000 years ago, and maybe much earlier. But curiously, the early down under colonists apparently did not make sophisticated tools, relying instead on simple Neanderthal style flaked stones and scrapers. They had few ornaments and little long distance trade, and left scant evidence that they hunted large marsupial mammals in their new homeland. Of course, they may have used sophisticated wood or bamboo tools that have decayed. But University of Utah anthropologist James F. OConnell offers another explanation the early settlers did not bother with sophisticated technologies because they did not need them. That these people were modern and innovative is clear getting to New Guinea Australia from the mainland required at least one sea voyage of more than 45 miles, an astounding achievement. But once in place, the colonists faced few pressures to innovate or adapt new technologies. In particular, OConnell notes, there were few people, no shortage of food and no need to compete with an indigenous population like Europes Neanderthals. Modern humans eventually made their first forays into Europe only about 40,000 years ago, presumably delayed by relatively cold and inhospitable weather and a less than welcoming Neanderthal population. The conquest of the continentif that is what it wasis thought to have lasted about 15,000 years, as the last pockets of Neanderthals dwindled to extinction. The European penetration is widely regarded as the decisive event of the great migration, eliminating as it did our last rivals and enabling the moderns to survive there uncontested. Did modern humans wipe out the competition, absorb them through interbreeding, outthink them or simply stand by while climate, dwindling resources, an epidemic or some other natural phenomenon did the job? Perhaps all of the above. Archaeologists have found little direct evidence of confrontation between the two peoples. Skeletal evidence of possible interbreeding is sparse, contentious and inconclusive. And while interbreeding may well have taken place, recent DNA studies have failed to show any consistent genetic relationship between modern humans and Neanderthals. You are always looking for a neat answer, but my feeling is that you should use your imagination, says Harvard University archaeologist Ofer Bar Yosef. There may have been positive interaction with the diffusion of technology from one group to the other. Or the modern humans could have killed off the Neanderthals. Or the Neanderthals could have just died out. Instead of subscribing to one hypothesis or two, I see a composite. Modern humans next conquest was the New World, which they reached by the Bering Land Bridgeor possibly by boatat least 15,000 years ago. Some of the oldest unambiguous evidence of humans in the New World is human DNA extracted from coprolitesfossilized fecesfound in Oregon and recently carbon dated to 14,300 years ago. For many years paleontologists still had one gap in their story of how humans conquered the world. They had no human fossils from sub Saharan Africa from between 15,000 and 70,000 years ago. Because the epoch of the great migration was a blank slate, they could not say for sure that the modern humans who invaded Europe were functionally identical to those who stayed behind in Africa. But one day in 1999, anthropologist Alan Morris of South Africas University of Cape Town showed Frederick Grine, a visiting colleague from Stony Brook University, an unusual looking skull on his bookcase. Morris told Grine that the skull had been discovered in the 1950s at Hofmeyr, in South Africa. No other bones had been found near it, and its original resting place had been befouled by river sediment. Any archaeological evidence from the site had been destroyedthe skull was a seemingly useless artifact. But Grine noticed that the braincase was filled with a carbonate sand matrix. Using a technique unavailable in the 1950s, Grine, Morris and an Oxford University led team of analysts measured radioactive particles in the matrix. The skull, they learned, was 36,000 years old. Comparing it with skulls from Neanderthals, early modern Europeans and contemporary humans, they discovered it had nothing in common with Neanderthal skulls and only peripheral similarities with any of todays populations. But it matched the early Europeans elegantly. The evidence was clear. Thirty six thousand years ago, says Morris, before the worlds human population differentiated into the mishmash of races and ethnicities that exist today, We were all Africans.

But paleontologists Mark Witton and Darren Naish think this may be the wrong picture, at least for the largest pterosaurs, including the giraffe sized Quetzalcoatlus. Its beak was too bulky and its neck too stiff for snatching fish on the wing and its feet were too dainty to keep all that pterosaur bulk from sinking into the mud if, as another popular guess holds, Q patrolled muddy shores like an overgrown sandpiper. Instead, the pair thinks the creatures stalked through grasslands on all fours, snapping at smaller reptiles and insects much the way storks feed today.

Geologic forces have created mountains where once an ancient river flowed, and it is here intrepid dinosaur hunters, such as William Hammer, come to search out the past. Hes made the journey from Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois, to Antarctica seven times in the last 30 years. Finding dinosaur fossils isnt all that hard, but extracting them is. Hammer and his colleagues camp out on a glacier for about two months during the Antarctic summerwith  20 degree temperatures and 24 hour daylight500 miles from the nearest medical aid. Though some of Hammers digs are accessible by snowmobile, the dinosaur site on the side of Mount Kirkpatrick can be reached only by helicopter and only when the weather cooperates. Then they have to hope that theyll be able to start the gas powered jackhammers, drills, and saws they use to extract large chunks of rock. This is a difficult task most days, made worse when the tools plastic casings get so cold and brittle that they break. Some days are better than others, especially when it comes to transportation. During his last trip, there was a problem with one of the helicopters, Hammer explains. They said they did a hard landing, but when the landing gear goes through the bottom of the helicopter, to me, thats a crash. Given the conditions, Hammer doesnt search for anything in particular. We look for whatever we can find, he says, and theyve made some amazing finds The fossilized bones of a 22 foot long meat eating crested dinosaur, called\u00a0Cryolophosaurus elloti, were covered with teeth from small theropods relatives of\u00a0Tyrannosaurus rex that had scavenged the large polar dinosaur after its death. Plant remains nearby and the sediments in which the bones were buried indicate that the dinosaur probably lived at a time when the regions climate was cool temperate, like coastal Washington state but not as wet, Hammer says. And though the bones cant tell him much about the animals physiology or behavior, he says, the dinosaurs and other animals we find do not show any special adaptations for cold or darkness, unlike some polar dinosaur remains found in Australia. There have been plenty of non dino fossils, too, especially from the time period before dinosaurs lived. These have included weird amphibians with three foot long skulls that look like toilet lids, Hammer says, and his favorite, the front end of the snout of another amphibian with three inch long fangs. Despite the weather, altitude, and occasionally scary rides in ski planes and helicopters, Hammer keeps going south to search for more. Hes hoping to return in the next year or two so he can extract some bones that he found during his last expedition.

Over the past several decades the scientists who study the history of plant life  known as paleobotanists, or paleobots for short  have been building up a picture of how groups of plants have responded to climate changes. In doing so, theyve created a picture of how ecosystems evolve that may change how we think about the multibillion dollar business of conservation. Back in 1889 a young explorer and biologist named C. Hart Merriam climbed 12,633 foot Humphreys Peak in the San Francisco Peaks in Arizona. He noted what many mountaineers had noted before that as he climbed, the plant life changed radically. Starting among the cacti of the Sonoran Desert, he climbed into a pine forest at 7,000 feet and a treeless alpine tundra at the summit. It seemed to him that the plants at a given altitude were associated in what came to be called communities  groupings of interacting species. The idea was that over the course of time, plants that require particular climate and soil conditions come to live in the same places, and hence are frequently to be found together. An oak hickory forest might be one such community, a spruce fir forest another. What the paleobots are asking is whether these associations, real in the present, are permanent. A great natural experiment took place on this planet between 25,000 and 10,000 years ago, when small changes in the earths orbit and axis of rotation caused great sheets of ice to spread from the poles. These glaciers covered much of North America and Europe to depths of up to two miles, and then, as the climate warmed, they retreated. During this retreat, they left behind newly uncovered land for living things to colonize, and as those living things moved in they laid down a record we can read now. Today the study of tree migration is a growth industry in the past couple of years workshops on the subject have been held in California and Australia. Think about a lake in New England, a few miles south of the retreating ice. As plants started to grow nearby, they would release pollen into the air. Some of these grains would fall into the lake, sink to the bottom and be incorporated into the sediments. As the climate warmed and the ice sheet moved farther north, different plants would grow near the lake and their pollen grains would land in new layers of sediment. Today scientists can drill into that lake bottom, bring up a core and read the record of nearby plant life from the first colonizers at the bottom to the current tenants at the top. If communities are defined as associations of plants that migrate together as well as simply live together, you would expect to see ecosystems marching north in lockstep. The fossil record seems clear, however there is little or no evidence that entire groups of plants moved north together. Things that lived together in the past dont live together now, and things that live together now didnt live together in the past. Instead of stable collections of plants and animals following the glaciers north, we find each individual organism moving at its own pace. At any given time during a migration, particular organisms happen to be grouped together, but those groupings are just snapshots of a continuously changing reality. What does this lack of community during migrations say about the webs of interaction we see in current ecosystems? And what does it tell us about how we should act to conserve the natural world? In an Italian restaurant near the University of Chicago, I raised these questions with two old friends, David Jablonski and Sue Kidwell, husband and wife paleontologists who, although they normally work in different areas, have come to remarkably similar conclusions on the subject of communities. Kidwell notes that the fossil record really makes you question how much glue there is holding communities together. The plants and animals dont seem to care who theyre living with, and all the different combinations seem to work equally well. To which Jablonski adds There seems to be something like a backlash developing against the idea of communities. Theres a lot more interchangeability among members of an ecosystem than people had thought. The two are quick to point out that as with most rules relating to living systems, there are exceptions to this one. Biologists can sometimes identify a so called keystone species  a pollinating insect, for example  that plays such a crucial role that its removal can result in the upheaval of the entire ecosystem. Nevertheless, interchangeability over geologic time seems to be much more the rule than the exception. If the relationships between members of an ecosystem are indeed as malleable as this story suggests, then the lack of community in the northward movement of life after the glaciers is easy to understand. As each new association formed, an essential role that had been played by one species would be taken over by another. Ecosystems can stand a little loss and invasion, says Jablonski. Some give and take need not be fatal in fact, its natural. To nail down the past, paleontologists are compiling databases of everything they have on past ecosystems. The palynologists, who study pollen, are key players, as are their colleagues who study phytoliths, microscopic glass like secretions of plants long gone. The work involves more than academic curiosity. Policymakers have to take the best information that scientists can come up with and make difficult decisions. As a people, we Americans have decided that we want to preserve at least a part of our natural environment. We cant preserve everything, however, and that means we have to have some way of choosing between competing conservation strategies. This choice depends, in turn, on what we think it is important to conserve. When we thought the most important thing to do was to save a species, we concentrated on how to save a particular sand dune or prairie that was home to that species. Today conservationists are more likely to talk about preserving entire ecosystems the Greater Yellowstone Region, for example, or the Everglades. It may be time, however, to focus on a different goal. We should concentrate on preserving the ability of plants and animals to respond to environmental changes. We should be thinking about establishing reserves that cross environmental gradients, argues Jablonski. We should think of ecosystems as sets of living organisms that need to expand and contract and shift around. Such shifting already occurs in nature, of course. The Hawaiian Islands have been created by progressively newer volcanoes rising above the sea surface. As the older islands slowly sink again, the corals that are able to migrate move upward so that they remain at the same depth. Not all of them move fast enough. Other organisms, for various reasons, have had an even harder time Hawaii has probably lost a greater percentage of its flora and fauna than any other place in the United States. The fossil record seems to be telling us that we should be thinking about preserving species by giving them room to maneuver. Jablonski suggests, for example, that if we make an environmental preserve in the Amazon, we should include some foothills of the Andes to protect this kind of flexibility. That philosophy could guide the creation of new parks and preserves in other parts of the world, too. In the United States, unfortunately, our parks and preserves are often surrounded by expensive development. It is very difficult to change boundaries that have existed for decades, even when we find out we should have done things differently. Had we known a century ago what we know now, we might, for example, have extended the boundaries of places like Yellowstone Park to include greater ranges of elevation. We might have bought more inland acres when establishing coastal preserves, to maintain the ability of coastal ecosystems to migrate landward if sea levels rise in the next century. Even if our current choices are limited, I expect that these new ideas will have an impact on how we spend our conservation dollars in the future. The implications go further. If the climate does warm, natural ecosystems are not the only ones that will be moving north those associated with agriculture will be doing the same. We normally think of an Iowa cornfield as a monoculture, but as every farmer knows, all sorts of varmints, weeds and insects live in even that simplified system. If the Corn Belt moves north to Minnesota, the paleobots are telling us, the rest of the community may not move with it like one big unhappy family. Knowing what will happen in advance could be worth billions of dollars to American agriculture. As I left that restaurant and walked out into the cold Chicago night, I felt strangely elated. For one thing, it seemed to me that this new understanding could move the entire environmental debate to a new and more realistic level. Perhaps even more important, though, it confirmed my belief in the value of basic research, which is sometimes portrayed as the pursuit of useless knowledge. We have much to learn from something as seemingly useless as ancient pollen grains in the mud at the bottom of an ordinary lake."}]}
